Rental Giant Hertz Could Be in Bankruptcy in Weeks, Destroying(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) What's Left of the Used Car Market .
2020-05-11 15:47:50 +00:00 .
From Road Track Car rental giant Hertz is currently in talks(#included currently) with creditors in hopes(#included currently) of avoiding(#after 2020-05-11 15:47:50) a bankruptcy(#included currently) that could be just weeks away , Bloomberg reports(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) .
Road Track Car rental giant Hertz has been given(#before May 22) until May 22 to come(#before May 22) up with $ 400 million for holders of Road Track Car rental giant Hertz asset - backed securities , but the greater problem Road Track Car rental giant Hertz faces(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) is a little more complex .
Road Track Car rental giant Hertz ’s most obvious avenue for raising(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) cash would be to sell(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) down parts of its rental car fleet , which numbers above 560,000 cars in the U.S. , not counting(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz international operations .
But the resale values of the rental vehicles Road Track Car rental giant Hertz currently owns(#included currently) have been pummeled(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) by the tremendous drop in sales(#included currently) caused(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) by the pandemic , dropping(#included April) by 70 percent in April alone .
Bloomberg reports(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) that Road Track Car rental giant Hertz ’s two main banks , Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc , have to decide(#after 2020-05-11 15:47:50) in the next two weeks whether to allow(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz to try(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) to raise(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) money by selling(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) off large parts of its rental car fleet , which numbers above 560,000 cars in the U.S. or let(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz go(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) into bankruptcy(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) .
Neither option would be particularly pleasant , and there are still plenty of unknowns even in these scenarios .
Bloomberg describes(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz ’s situation as a three - way standoff : Holders of Hertz ’s asset - backed securities could delay(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) pressuring(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz to sell(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) down its rental car fleet , which numbers above 560,000 cars in the U.S. for a short period of time , but Holders of Hertz ’s asset - backed securities will need(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Hertz ’s banks to promise(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) to make(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Hertz ’s banks whole .
Hertz ’s banks , in turn , may not want(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) to take(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) on such a risk , which requires(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Hertz ’s banks to bet(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) that either the rental car business or used(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) car prices return(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) to some normal operating level .
Meanwhile , controlling shareholder Carl Icahn holds(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) a 39 percent equity stake in Road Track Car rental giant Hertz .
Bloomberg says(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) that Bloomberg could put(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) in more money to keep(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz afloat , but put once again is dependent(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) on a belief that the rental car business will recover(#after 2020-05-11 15:47:50) to some extent in the very near future .
In a bankruptcy(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) , Bloomberg notes(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) , equity holders ’ claims would be behind those of creditors , which is not an incentive for controlling shareholder Carl Icahn to put(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) in more money at the moment .
One possible way out of this is banks letting(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz issue(#after 2020-05-11 15:47:50) more debt , but this once again relies(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) largely on a bet on a domestic and international recovery in the rental car business in the near future .
Otherwise , this only buys(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) Road Track Car rental giant Hertz a short period of time before an eventual bankruptcy(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) .
That bankruptcy(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) could flood(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) the used car market with several hundred thousand cars , whose value is likely to take a substantial hit at a time when used car lots are already quite full and demand is low .
Bloomberg notes(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) that used car prices dropped(#included March) 11.4 percent from March to April , while sales were merely a quarter of pre - outbreak levels .
Dealer auctions that would liquidate(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) several hundred thousand cars , whose value is likely to take a substantial hit at a time when used car lots are already quite full and demand is low have also cut(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) back operations on dropping(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) demand by used car lots .
Road Track Car rental giant Hertz sells(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) used(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) cars as a part of Road Track Car rental giant Hertz business , but how long it would take(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) to sell(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) over 500,000 used(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) cars in the U.S. , at prices reasonably close to their market value , is perhaps a question of years , not months .
Like airlines and hotels , the car rental companies are facing(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) a massive drop in business as a result of the pandemic .
the rental car business largely depends(#overlap 2020-05-11 15:47:50) on airline travelers , who at the moment are not doing any domestic traveling(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) that would keep(#before 2020-05-11 15:47:50) rental companies afloat .
Among other things , depends means that Road Track Car rental giant Hertz is not the sole rental company in trouble , but at the same time there is little prospect of any federal bailout for rental car companies , unlike airlines .
