When the doors spilled(#included 33.7500) open , Dejene ’s friend Mulugeta , 19 carried(#included 33.7500) Dejene Degefa outside .

All he ’d wants(#overlap 2020-05-15 12:55:46) is to see(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:46) he ’d family .
“ Dejene Degefa would rather beg(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:46) to feed(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:46) Dejene Degefa than go(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:46) back , ” Dejene Degefa said(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:46) .
