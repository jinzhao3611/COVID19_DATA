On an unseasonably warm Friday morning , the National Park Service announced(#included Friday morning) that Washington ’s cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin reached(#included Thursday) an unusually early peak bloom .
an unusually early peak bloom is the earliest since 2012 ( when an unusually early peak bloom also occurred(#included March 20) on March 20 ) and tied(#included March 20th) for the third earliest on record .
In the the National Park Service ’s 99 - year record dating(#after 2012) to 1921 , the only years with earlier bloom dates were 1990 ( March 15 ) and 2000 ( March 17 ) .
Normally , Cherry blossoms attract(#included 1990) 1.5 million visitors but much smaller numbers are anticipated(#included this week) this year .
Because of the coronavirus , local officials are urging(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:31:19) the Tidal Basin visitors to maintain(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:31:19) social distance or avoid(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:31:19) the area altogether .
A livestream of the Tidal Basin is available to see(#included Thursday) Cherry blossoms remotely .

On Friday morning , as Cherry blossoms hit(#included Friday morning) peak , A livestream of the Tidal Basin showed(#included Friday morning) a steady flow of visitors but much lighter crowds than usual .
The National Cherry Blossom Festival , which runs(#included 1990) March 20 to April 12 , cancelled(#included March 20th) all events including(#included March 20th) the April 4 parade(#included March 20th) .
Abnormally warm weather during late winter and early spring propelled(#included this week) Cherry blossoms to the early bloom , some 11 days ahead of the 30 - year average of March and two weeks ahead of the longer - term ( 1921 to 2019 ) average of April 4 .
By definition , peak bloom(#included Thursday) occurs(#before 2020-03-20 15:31:19) when 70 percent of the cherry trees are flowering(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:31:19) .
Once peak bloom is reached(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:31:19) , the blossom petals can remain(#after 2020-03-20 15:31:19) for a week or so if the blossom petals ’s dry and winds are light .
But in some years , petals have fallen(#before 2020-03-20 15:31:19) off sooner because of wind , rain or frost .
this year , the best blossom viewing(#included early spring) is likely between Friday and Sunday although breezy conditions into the weekend may result(#included March 20) in some loss(#included March 20) of petals .
On Saturday night , there ’s an outside chance of frost , but temperatures should remain(#included March 20) above freezing and the risk of damage(#before 2020-03-20 15:31:19) or significant wilting is small .
By Saturday night and Monday , steady rain is expected(#included March 20) which may end(#after 2020-03-20 15:31:19) an unusually early peak bloom .
Due to the unusual warmth , peak bloom occurred(#included Thursday) on the early side of predictions(#before 2020-03-20 15:31:19) .
The Capital Weather Gang had predicted(#included March 20) peak bloom to occur(#included March 20) between March 20 and 24 ( a revision(#included early spring) from an initial forecast(#included March 20) of March 25 to 29 ) .
The the National Park Service ’s forecast(#included March 20) for peak bloom was between March 21 and 24 ( a revision(#included this week) from an initial forecast of March 27 to 30 ) .
