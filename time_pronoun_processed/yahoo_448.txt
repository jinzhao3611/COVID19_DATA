The changes could come(#included Friday) into effect from Friday but Sturgeon has already warned(#before 2020-05-28 08:31:31) not all the measures(#before 2020-05-28 08:31:31) in phase one of a four - part plan for easing the restrictions – which were put in place more than nine weeks ago on March 23 will necessarily be introduced(#after 2020-05-28 08:31:31) immediately .
