Wait, so who is Nero, and why are people comparing(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) Nero, to Trump? .
2020-03-09 19:44:25 +00:00 .
The meme drew(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) speculation that The meme was related(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to the QAnon conspiracy theorists , as The Washington Post ’s Timothy Bella described(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) here .
But Walter Shaub , director of the Office of Government Ethics from 2013 to 2017 , had(#included 2013) another idea : Nero was the notorious emperor of Rome , who , as legend has(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) it , “ fiddled(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) while Rome burned(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) . ”
By Monday morning , # NeroTrump was a top trend(#included Monday morning) on Twitter .
A history lesson is definitely in order .
Nero , was born(#included 37) Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus in 37 A.D. ; his mother Agrippina conspired(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) by an incestuous marriage to make(#included 37) Nero the next in line for the throne .
Her husband / uncle , the emperor Claudius , died(#included Monday morning) by poisoning(#included 37) soon after , making(#included 37) Nero at the time , the fifth emperor of Rome .
his mother Agrippina attempted(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to rule(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) via Her husband / uncle , the emperor Claudius but was soon exiled(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) and later executed(#included Monday morning) .
And as Nero grew(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) into a young man , Nero was kind of always DTFF — down to feast(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) and frolic(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) .
Nero threw(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) lavish parties in extravagant palaces , slept(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) with anyone Nero wanted(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) , and even took(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to the stage as an actor , poet and musician .
The elites of Rome were not impressed(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) .
Orgies were one thing , but acting(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) ?
In plays ?
acting cheapened(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) the throne , The elites of Rome complained(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) .
Then , in 37 A.D. , Nero announced(#included 37) Nero wanted(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to level(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) and rebuild(#after 2020-03-09 19:44:25) most of city in a more contemporary style .
The Roman Senate refused(#included economic) Nero permission .
Soon afterward , Rome caught(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) on fire .
Rome burned(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) for six days straight , then rekindled(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) and burned(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) for another three .
Ten of Rome ’s 14 districts were destroyed(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) .
And Nero soon began(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to build(#included economic) his massive “ Golden House ” on his massive “ Golden House ” smoldering(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) ashes .
But did Nero really fiddle(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) while Rome burned(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) ?
No , because fiddles did n’t exist(#before the Middle Ages) until the Middle Ages .
But Nero maybe played(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) Nero lyre ?
His first biographer , Tacitus , wrote(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) in His first biographer , Tacitus “ Annals ” that Nero was 30 miles away in Antium at the time , “ but at the very moment when Rome was aflame , Nero had mounted(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) Nero private stage , and typifying(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) the ills of the present by the calamities of the past , had sung the destruction of Troy . ”
But later biographers were even less charitable .
His first biographer , Tacitus claimed(#overlap 2020-03-09 19:44:25) witnesses caught(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) Nero setting(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) the fires , and that His first biographer , Tacitus watched(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) Antium burn(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) from a tower “ and exulting(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) , as His first biographer , Tacitus said(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) , in ‘ the beauty of the flames , ’ His first biographer , Tacitus sang(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) the whole of the ‘ Sack of Ilium , ’ in His first biographer , Tacitus regular stage costume . ”
Cassius Dio claimed(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) Cassius Dio hired(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to a bunch of thugs to set(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) fires and then watched(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) from the palace , singing(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) and playing(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) the lyre in costume .
The famous expression that “ Nero fiddled while Rome burned ” came(#before the Middle Ages) later , according to Encyclopaedia Britannica , but The famous expression that “ Nero fiddled while Rome burned ” was adapted(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) over centuries from an original story .
In any case , Nero ’s feckless response(#included PRESENT_REF) to the tragedy(#included PRESENT_REF) is now being compared(#included PRESENT_REF) to Trump ’s Twitter behavior amid the growing(#overlap 2020-03-09 19:44:25) crises of the coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) and the economic fallout .
Monday morning , as Americans nervously awaited(#included Monday morning) the opening bell on Wall Street , Trump tweeted(#included Monday morning) Trump usual complaints(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) about Democrats , the “ Deep State ” and the “ Fake News Media . ”
Soon after Trump retweeted(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) The meme , CNN legal analyst Renato Mariotti had(#before 2020-03-09 19:44:25) this warning , “ CNN might want(#overlap 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to look(#after 2020-03-09 19:44:25) up what happened(#overlap 2020-03-09 19:44:25) to Nero . ”
