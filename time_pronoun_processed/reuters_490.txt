But this year , An online Ramadan bazaar trader started(#included this year) taking(#included this year) orders on Whatsapp and Facebook weeks before the Muslim fasting(#included April 23) month began(#included this year) on April 23 , as authorities across Southeast Asia called(#included April 23) off Ramadan bazaars amid the coronavirus pandemic .
“ This is the first time Whatsapp and Facebook are selling(#included April 23) online , so Whatsapp and Facebook wanted(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) to start(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) early to make(#overlap 2020-04-28 02:09:19) sure Whatsapp and Facebook customers can find(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) Whatsapp and Facebook , ” Siti Zabedah Abdul Wahab told(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) Reuters .
Ramadan is traditionally a lucrative time for food vendors in Muslim - majority countries , with more people going out for late - night meals after breaking(#included April 23) more people going out for late - night meals fast at sunset .
But the global virus outbreak(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) , with more than 2.6 million people infected(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) , has led(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) to widespread curbs(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) .
Malaysian authorities have imposed(#before mid - May) a partial lockdown(#included this year) until mid - May and called(#before mid - May) off Ramadan bazaars .
Ramadan bazaars are usually attended(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) by packed crowds and feature(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) hundreds of stalls selling(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) food for iftar , or the fast - breaking meal .
The movement curbs have forced(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) thousands of street hawkers and vendors to embrace(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) digital platforms , mirroring(#included April 23) a shift(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) in neighbouring Indonesia , where roadside businesses enjoy(#overlap 2020-04-28 02:09:19) a sizeable online presence .
“ In Indonesia , you can order(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) pretty much anything you want(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) on an app , ” said(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) Rosli Sulaiman , president of the Malaysian Malay Hawkers and Small Traders Association .
“ Here we have to do a bit more educating(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) as most vendors are used(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) to just being on the street .
Going(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) online or dealing(#overlap 2020-04-28 02:09:19) with cashless transactions(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) will be something new for most vendors . ”
Malaysian hawkers have been badly hit(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) by The movement curbs , with estimated(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) losses(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) of about 50 million ringgit ( $ 11.5 million ) for some 100,000 traders .
To soften(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) the impact(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) , several companies have developed(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) e - bazaar platforms to help(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) Ramadan traders partner(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) with delivery companies and reach more customers online .
“ It ’s going(#after 2020-04-28 02:09:19) to be a steep learning curve
but ... we have(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) no choice , ” Rosli Sulaiman , president of the Malaysian Malay Hawkers and Small Traders Association said(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) .
Many small food businesses , however , prefer(#overlap 2020-04-28 02:09:19) marketing directly to customers on social media as Many small food businesses do not earn(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) enough profit to share(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) with delivery firms .
Dozens of Ramadan bazaar groups have popped(#before 2020-04-28 02:09:19) up on Facebook .
