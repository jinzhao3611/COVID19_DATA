“ expanding will greatly reduce(#after 2020-03-20 19:47:27) the pressure on the muni money markets to cover(#after 2020-03-20 19:47:27) investor redemptions(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) while not tanking(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) the value of the underlying(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:47:27) municipal bonds the muni money markets hold(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:47:27) , specifically short maturity bonds and notes , ” Matt Fabian , the head of market and credit research at Municipal Market Analytics , said(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) in an email .
Matt Fabian , the head of market and credit research at Municipal Market Analytics , added(#included 2020-04-01) that most of the market ’s liquidity pressure “ is exactly in this part of the curve , because investors are converting(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:47:27) many of their financial assets to cash without regard to what many of their financial assets are , ” Matt Fabian , the head of market and credit research at Municipal Market Analytics , added(#included 2020-04-01) .

“ Right now many of these money market securities are stuck(#included PRESENT_REF) on dealer / bank balance sheets and many of these money market securities keep(#included PRESENT_REF) moving(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) rates higher to try(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) to entice(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) buyers , ” Dan Solender , director of the municipal bond group at Lord Abbett , said(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) in an email .
“ So it will help(#after 2020-03-20 19:47:27) to clear(#after 2020-03-20 19:47:27) up some balance sheet space , which could be used(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) to buy(#after 2020-03-20 19:47:27) longer municipal bonds , but it remains(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:47:27) uncertain how much of an impact clear would have(#before 2020-03-20 19:47:27) . ”
