LONDON , March 20 ( LPC ) - While fears(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) over the coronavirus outbreak grow(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) , direct lenders have(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) limited choice but to hold(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) onto direct lenders illiquid portfolios as the exit routes in mid - market lending remain(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) limited(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) .
Unlike the syndicated loan market , which has seen(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) a pick up in secondary trading activity following(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) the coronavirus outbreak , loan transfers in direct lending are still in an infancy stage .
Direct lenders tend(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to hold(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) loans until maturity .
“ Most direct lending deals are on a bilateral basis .
It is a take - and - hold industry and offers(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) a limited opportunity to trade(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) out a position that you are in , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) Floris Hovingh , partner and head of alternative capital solutions at Deloitte .
“ Selling(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) direct lending loans mid - way in their life would get(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) lot of questions from the potential buyers . ”
A meaningful secondary market was just beginning(#included PRESENT_REF) to develop(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) for the sale and purchase(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) of mid - market direct lending loans , however market volatility triggered(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) by the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak has made(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) any trade(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) very difficult because of a massive gap between bid and ask spreads .
“ It ’s very hard to sell(#included PRESENT_REF) anything now as it will be very depressed(#included PRESENT_REF) in terms of valuation .
No one would sell(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) at a deep discount , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) Floris Hovingh , partner and head of alternative capital solutions at Deloitte , adding(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) direct lenders need(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to reassess(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) direct lenders portfolio to understand(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) which companies direct lenders might need(#after 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to support(#after 2020-03-20 15:46:47) in difficult times .
OPAQUE MARKET
Since A meaningful secondary market is still in A meaningful secondary market infancy , any talks(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) on loan transfers(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) are all in private .
“ No one would sound(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) out loud about selling(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) their loans , ” a head of a direct lender said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) .
In addition , the time and efforts on due diligence spent(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) on a secondary trade(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) are similar to a primary deal(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) .
European direct lender Kartesia acquired(#included 2018) an outstanding unitranche facility in Spanish dental services provider Vitaldent in 2018 from another lender but only after holding(#included 2018) rounds of conversations with majority owner JB Capital and following(#included 2018) the improvement(#included 2018) in trading(#included 2018) performance .
an outstanding unitranche facility in Spanish dental services provider Vitaldent was a profitable trade(#included 2018) for European direct lender Kartesia , sources said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) , which existed(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) the position in less than a year when Advent International agreed(#included June 2019) to buy(#included June 2019) Spanish dental services provider Vitaldent in June 2019 .
GREATER ACCESS
Despite being hard for direct lenders to trade(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) out of direct lenders loan positions , direct lenders do have(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) a great amount of access to portfolio companies compared(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to a number of larger borrowers in the syndicated loan market .
“ Direct lenders often have(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) a majority vote in the loans(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) with good management access , which improves(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) communication and decision(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) making(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) .
Direct lenders are also senior secured(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) lenders to be the first in line to get(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) the collateral if loans turn(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) sour , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) Floris Hovingh , partner and head of alternative capital solutions at Deloitte .
To most direct lenders , collaboration is the key(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) once portfolio companies start(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to underperform(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) .
“ Identifying(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) the problems and collaborating(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) with the private equity sponsors is the best way to get(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) your money back .
You do n’t want(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to threaten(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) the private equity sponsors and burn(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) any bridges as the private equity sponsors are less likely to support(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) Spanish dental services provider Vitaldent , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) Nicole Downer , managing partner at MV Credit .
Nicole Downer , managing partner at MV Credit added(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) that options to help(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) companies include(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) converting(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) cash interest into accrued interest payments(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) to boost(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) firms ’ liquidity .
“ Giving(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) space to breathe(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) is important in a difficult time , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) Nicole Downer , managing partner at MV Credit .
“ This approach has proven(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) successful in MV Credit ’s two - decade investment(#before 2020-03-20 15:46:47) experience and we continue(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) stand(#overlap 2020-03-20 15:46:47) by This approach . ”
