sucked is billed(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) as the steepest fall(#included -) for the industry in any year .
Capacity utilisation(#included FY19) in FY21 is seen(#included FY19) at 40 - 45 per cent .
Even before the onset(#included FY19) of Covid-19 , cement producers were wrestling(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) with an economic slump .
In the last fiscal , cement output fell(#included FY19) by 0.8 per cent as against a growth(#included FY19) of 13.3 per cent registered(#included FY19) in FY19 .

After easing(#included FY19) of curbs , cement manufacturers have resumed(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) operations(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) .
However , due to limited manpower availability and logistics constraints , the plants are running(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) at depleted(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) capacity .
Logistics and transportation continue(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) to be a stumbling block as priority of Railways is on transporting(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) essential goods .
Due to bleak outlook(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) and unfavourable business conditions , cement companies are unlikely to make(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) fresh additions to existing(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) Capex ( Capital expenditure(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) ) as demand stays(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) muted .

Flagging(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) demand in the domestic market has unnerved(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) cement makers as the country is the world ’s second - largest cement market , both in production(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) and consumption .
“ Weakness in housing demand , prolonged rains in many parts of the country and decline(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) in demand from the infrastructure segment due to lack of funding and halting / temporary stoppage of state projects following(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) change in government post state elections(#included FY19) has had(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) a negative bearing on the production(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) of cement in the domestic markets .

As per the Cement Manufacturers Association , the country accounts(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) for eight per cent of the world ’s installed(#overlap 2020-05-28 12:55:41) capacity .
The nameplate capacity of cement manufacturers has increased(#before 2020-05-28 12:55:41) at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate ( CAGR ) of 7.1 per cent during FY16 - FY20 .
Manufacturers maintained(#included FY16) a capacity utilisation(#included FY16) rate of 65 - 70 per cent between FY15 and FY19 .
But prolonged rains and government - enforced nationwide lockdown(#included FY20) shrunk(#included FY20) the capacity utilisation(#included FY16) rate from 70 per cent in FY19 to 61 per cent in FY20 .
