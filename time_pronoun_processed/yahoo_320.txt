2020-03-04 01:35:05 +00:00 .
US President Donald Trump ’s unpredictable nature and the fact that US President Donald Trump has further surrounded(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) US President Donald Trump with China hawks has led(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) to uncertainty and a strain on American alliances , a former US senior official said(#included Tuesday) on Tuesday .
Speaking(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) at an event in the Hudson Institute in Washington , a former US senior official , said(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) the “ real deep state in the US government ” is wary of US President Donald Trump and is unsure about US President Donald Trump real stance(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) on China .
“ On the one hand , US President Donald Trump has(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) a deeply abiding respect for President Xi [ Jinping ] , but probably for the wrong reasons , because US President Donald Trump 's an extraordinarily effective autocrat .
Look at how US President Donald Trump treats(#overlap 2020-03-04 01:35:05) the press and US President Donald Trump political adversaries , ” a former US senior official said(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) .
a former US senior official said(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) questions have also been raised(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) about whether US President Donald Trump would support(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) Taiwan against increasing(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) threats from China , noting(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) that when US President Donald Trump occasionally speaks(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) about Hong Kong , US President Donald Trump “ sounds(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) a little bit more like a Chinese leader than American one ” , which has aroused(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) wariness in some corners , including(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) the White House ’s National Security Council ( NSC ) .
a former US senior official added(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) : “ There is a very substantial effort now in the US government that really believes(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) that China is the next threat .
… a former US senior official 'm not really sure(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) how that will play(#after 2020-03-04 01:35:05) out , but a former US senior official do believe(#overlap 2020-03-04 01:35:05) some of our alliances will be under greater stress and strain .
some of our alliances leaders really have to figure(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) out how to manage(#overlap 2020-03-04 01:35:05) the unpredictability of US President Donald Trump . ”
Last week , National Security Council ( NSC spokesman John Ullyot said(#included Tuesday) the US government was considering(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) a range of responses(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) to retaliate(#included Last week) for China ’s “ egregious act ” in expelling(#included Last week) three Wall Street Journal reporters .

Last year , White House appointed(#included Last year) Elnigar Iltebir , a Uygur - American scholar , to direct(#included Last year) the National Security Council ( NSC ’s China policy , which was deemed(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) a “ poke in the eye ” to Beijing by analysts .
As the coronavirus that started(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) in China ’s central city of Wuhan spreads(#overlap 2020-03-04 01:35:05) globally , many recent Washington discussions(#included recent) have focused(#included recent) on whether the US government should distance(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) the US government economically and politically from China , moves(#included right) that would further harm(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) the already wobbly bilateral relationship between the world ’s two largest economies .
The coronavirus epidemic(#overlap 2020-03-04 01:35:05) – described(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) by a former US senior official as “ the third biggest crisis(#included right) since the end of the Cold War ” , the previous two being the 9/11 terrorism attack(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) and the 2008 financial collapse(#included 2008) – will likely cause(#after 2020-03-04 01:35:05) a near - term shortage in Chinese - made drugs and medical equipment in the US government .
“ The truth though is that the political atmosphere right now is more like the 1930s , divisively nationalistic , and the political atmosphere right now is causing(#included right) countries to separate rather than basically working(#overlap 2020-03-04 01:35:05) together , ” a former US senior official said(#before 2020-03-04 01:35:05) .
