“ We ’ve been separated(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) before , but this is n’t like Christmas or summer time , when this ’s long but We ’ve doing a million other things , ” said(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) Lola Gomez , a 22 - year - old drama student from Malaga , .
“ This quarantine means a lot of time alone , thinking(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) , asking(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) yourself questions - a lot of time shut(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) in too .
You miss(#overlap 2020-03-24 18:22:02) You partner so much more .
To be honest , We ’ve having(#overlap 2020-03-24 18:22:02) a rough time of This quarantine . ”
SHARING A DRINK ...
REMOTELY Etienne Berges , a 26 - year - old humanitarian policy adviser working in Myanmar , will not be seeing(#after 2020-03-24 18:22:02) his girlfriend , Amber Medland , as expected(#included next month) next month .
On March 16 , Myanmar made(#included March 16) quarantine mandatory for anyone arriving(#included March 16) from coronavirus - infected countries - meaning(#included March 16) his girlfriend , Amber Medland , would spend(#after 2020-03-24 18:22:02) his girlfriend , Amber Medland entire holiday in medical isolation .
“ We usually try(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) to manage(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) the distance by setting(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) down dates , ” Etienne Berges , a 26 - year - old humanitarian policy adviser working in Myanmar said(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) .
“ But ( the outbreak ) upended(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) even We ability to do spend . ”
Still , the couple is finding(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) ways to be together across continents : surprise macaroon deliveries , video - calling while sharing(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) a drink or watching(#overlap 2020-03-24 18:22:02) the same TV show .
the couple have taken(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) to dining together , and always video(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) one another from bed at night .
“ That way , you give(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) and get(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) tenderness before sleeping(#included gone) , ” Lola Gomez , a 22 - year - old drama student from Malaga , said(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) .
It is not quite the same as the real thing , however .
“ The person you love(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) should be the one person you can break confinement with , completely - because you lay(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) beside the one person you can break confinement with at night .
And I ca n’t , ” said(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) I .
As the outbreak spreads , separated couples are facing(#overlap 2020-03-24 18:22:02) the fact that days apart turn(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) into weeks , and now possibly months .
“ Coronavirus questions(#overlap 2020-03-24 18:22:02) the nature of long distance relationships , erases(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) that peace of mind you used(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) to get(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) thinking(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) , ‘ Oh , I can be there this afternoon ’ , ” I said(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) .
“ The certainty is gone(#before 2020-03-24 18:22:02) . ”
