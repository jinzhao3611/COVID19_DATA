CGT has urged(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) companies that have adequate safety measures in place to continue(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) their activities if possible , though urged has met(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) with growing(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) resistance from unions , with some in sectors such as weapons and defence manufacturing questioning(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) whether some in sectors such as weapons and defence manufacturing operations were essential .
PSA has suspended(#before 2020-03-27) output in all PSA European plants until March 27 and has not given(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) a target date for restarting(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) production(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) .
But PSA said(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) pilot plants in Valenciennes and Douvrin , in northern France , could possibly restart(#included 2020-04) from early April with volunteers .
“ PSA will absolutely not jeopardise(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) PSA workers ’ health , so that the industrial restart(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) that is necessary to safeguard(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) the future of PSA can be done in optimal conditions , ” PSA chief Carlos Tavares said(#included 2020-04-03) in a statement(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday .
PSA will take(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) workers ’ body temperatures , provide(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) face masks and ensure(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) ample spacing at each workplace .
PSA will also keep(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) all doors except fire doors open so as to avoid(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) infection via door handles(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) .
PSA will also disinfect(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) tools and work surfaces every 60 minutes , workers will have to wait(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) three hours before touching(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) a component that has been handled(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) by another worker and breaks will be lengthened(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) by five minutes for handwashing .
PSA will also double(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) the number of shuttle buses to ensure(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) better spacing(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) between passengers .
PSA will apply(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) these measures not only in PSA assembly plants but also at sales and administrative sites .
“ these measures are quite robust , but the time has not yet come(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) .
Restarting(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) work would be premature as long as the peak of the epidemic(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) is not behind PSA , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) Sebastien Leroy , CFTC union member at the Valenciennes gearbox plant .
PSA aims(#included 2020-04-03) to restart(#included 2021-03-30) the Valenciennes gearbox plant on April 3 and Valenciennes on March 30 , the Valenciennes site with reduced(#included 2020-04-03) staffing of 200 people and output of just 70 gearboxes per day .
“ PSA do n’t get(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) it .
France is preparing(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) to extend(#after 2020-04-03 07:29:24) confinement and at the same time PSA is organising(#overlap 2020-04-03 07:29:24) de - confinement , ” PSA union member Jean - Pierre Mercier said(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) .

“ At the moment , we have(#included 2020-04-03) no need to manufacture(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) airplanes , ships or cars .
Or lipstick , for that matter , ” CGT leader Philippe Martinez speaking on radio station RFI said(#before 2020-04-03 07:29:24) .
