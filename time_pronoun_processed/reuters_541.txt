For doctors in northern Italy , fighting(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) what is still Europe ’s worst outbreak(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) of COVID-19 , the frontlines have moved(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) beyond hospitals as special teams try(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to keep(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) patients alive at home , away from the saturated(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) wards where thousands have died(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) .

Patients with symptoms that are not too severe are treated(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) at home in Bergamo , the epicentre of Italy 's outbreak , April 16 , 2020 , to avoid(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) overcrowding hospitals already overwhelmed(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) with patients needing(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) intensive care .

For staff on the so - called USCA ( Special Continuity Assistance Units ) teams , it has been a draining struggle(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) , initially hampered(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) by a shortage of vital protective gear , that mixes(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) emergency medicine with the shock of losing(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) unprecedented numbers of patients .
“ It was and still is a tough experience that will leave(#after 2020-04-17 14:25:23) It mark on everybody , ” said(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) Giulia Villa , a 33 - year - old doctor in the northern town of Bergamo , where hundreds have died(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) since Italy 's outbreak emerged(#included Feb. 21) in a nearby town on Feb. 21 .
“ We gave(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) everything We had(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) and We are still trying(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to help(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) people .
We especially want(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to relieve(#after 2020-04-17 14:25:23) the strain from hospitals by being able to treat(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) patients at home , ” Villa said(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) .
Accounting(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) for half of the more than 22,000 people who have died(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) from the coronavirus in Italy , Bergamo ’s home region of Lombardy on the border with Switzerland remains(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) one of the worst affected(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) zones in the world and Bergamo ’s home region of Lombardy on the border with Switzerland doctors have been under strain for weeks .
“ We saw(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) so many people who needed(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to be hospitalised(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) very quickly but the problem was , the ambulance service just could n’t keep(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) up , ” she said(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) , struggling(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to control(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) she emotions .
“ There was a huge number of phone calls(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) , unfortunately , to announce(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) deaths(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) which We just never had(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) before .
So We found(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) We more than treating(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) patients , confirming(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) many deaths(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) at home . ”
Lombardy is Italy ’s economic powerhouse with a hospital system to match(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) any in Europe , but Lombardy came(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) close to buckling(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) as ambulances ferried(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) in thousands of patients a day .
In a bid(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to relieve(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) the pressure(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) , authorities set(#included last month) up the USCA units last month , aiming(#included last month) to offer(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) more specialised treatment than family doctors were able to provide(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) , while keeping(#included last month) patients out of crowded hospitals .
Since March 19 , when the USCA units went(#included last month) into operation(#after March 19) , the USCA units have carried(#after March 19) out more than 1,000 home visits after initial problems getting(#after March 19) enough masks and protective equipment for the medical staff and vital oxygen bottles for patients with severe respiratory problems .
“ At the beginning we had(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) very ( little ) protective equipment , now we have(#included now) enough .
we have(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) masks , we have(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) glasses , we have(#included now) everything now , ” said(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) Roberto Moretti , the doctor in charge of primary health care in Bergamo .
For frontline medical staff like Villa , getting(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) ready(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to make(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) a home visit takes(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) at least 15 minutes as Roberto Moretti , the doctor in charge of primary health care in Bergamo dresses(#included now) in a full body suit with plastic covers for Roberto Moretti , the doctor in charge of primary health care in Bergamo hair and feet as well as gloves , a facemask and protective goggles .
Oxygen has also become(#included now) easier to provide(#included now) now that suppliers have begun(#included now) shipping(#included now) liquid oxygen .
But the personal toll has been enormous(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) as the teams deal(#included now) with sick and frightened people struggling(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) for life or preparing(#overlap 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to watch(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) a family member die(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) .
“ No one is prepared for this but we took(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) action immediately and certainly we had(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) really low moments , moments of fear and discomfort , ” Villa said(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) .
“ But the wish(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) to help(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) and survive(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) this awful situation was the strength that pushed(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) we on every day to help(#before 2020-04-17 14:25:23) people . ”
