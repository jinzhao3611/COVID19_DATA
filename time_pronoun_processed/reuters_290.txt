And now the plant ’s trading arm , Cashmere Capital are juggling(#included PRESENT_REF) . ”
The upturn(#included Feb 28) comes(#before 2020-02-28 13:59:35) as major international trading firms that previously relied on supplies from China are scrambling(#overlap 2020-02-28 13:59:35) to source(#before 2020-02-28 13:59:35) major international trading firms that previously relied on supplies from China goods .

Hubei province is home to 60 - 65 % of Chinese phosphate production(#overlap 2020-02-28 13:59:35) , according to analysts at brokerage Bernstein .
About 60 % of Hubei province ’s phosphate production(#included PRESENT_REF) has now been halted(#included PRESENT_REF) and shipments of phosphate - based fertilisers from China fell(#included February) by around 700,000 tonnes in February , said(#before 2020-02-28 13:59:35) Russian fertiliser major Phosagro .
