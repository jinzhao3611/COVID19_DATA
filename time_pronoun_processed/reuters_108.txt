By Tom Daly and Min Zhang BEIJING , March 27 ( Reuters ) - Aluminium stocks monitored(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) by the Shanghai Futures Exchange ( ShFE ) have fallen(#included March 27) for the first time in three months , data showed(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday , although experts say(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) fallen does not necessarily mean(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) China ’s coronavirus - hit demand is catching up with supply .
Inventories of aluminium in the Shanghai Futures Exchange ( ShFE ) warehouses across nine Chinese cities and regions slipped(#included the previous week) by 5,922 tonnes , or 1.1 % from the previous week to 528,072 tonnes , having previously risen(#after Dec 2018) non - stop since March 27 .
But Wang Hongfei , manager of the aluminium department at Antaike , noted(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) the Shanghai Futures Exchange ( ShFE ) data only covered(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) stocks for futures delivery(#after 2020-03-27 10:52:58) and not spot inventory for immediate purchase(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) , and said(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) the Chinese research house ’s own numbers were higher .
“ Actually , spot inventories have n’t fallen(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) at all .

While most processing plants were back at work now , most processing plants “ orders are not too good ” , Wen Xianjun , vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association , added(#included 2020-04-03) .
Exacerbating(#overlap 2020-03-27 10:52:58) the situation is the spread of the coronavirus virus across the globe .
China is the world ’s top aluminium exporter but China shipments are set(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) to drop(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) as overseas consumption falters(#overlap 2020-03-27 10:52:58) , while demand for steel- and copper - intensive goods like home appliances is also likely to suffer(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) .
ShFE copper inventories fell(#included the past week) for a second week , by 3.5 % to 364,040 tonnes .
Orders(#included the past week) over the past week were “ ordinary ” , said(#included March 27) a manager of a copper tube maker .
a manager of a copper tube maker did not rule(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) out a rebound in consumption ahead , however , noting(#included 2020-04-02) the peak summer season for air conditioners was approaching(#included summer) .

Stocks are still seasonally high(#included PRESENT_REF) , with hot - rolled and cold - rolled steel , used(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) in cars and home appliances , down only 0.7 % and 2 % , respectively .
“ Overseas demand is limited(#included PRESENT_REF) now , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) a steel trader in the southeastern city of Xiamen .
“ We can only digest(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) Stocks domestically , though digest wo n’t be fast . ”
China this month raised(#included this month) the export tax rebate on some steel products to the maximum 13 % to boost(#included this month) sales(#included 2020) after virus - disrupted shipments fell(#included this month) 27 % in the first two months of 2020 .
ShFE lead inventories , meanwhile , have now fallen(#included PRESENT_REF) for five straight weeks to ShFE lead inventories lowest since December 2018 .
“ Many secondary lead smelters are still under(#included PRESENT_REF) now due to the short supply of battery scrap , while demand is recovering(#overlap 2020-03-27 10:52:58) , ” sending(#overlap 2020-03-27 10:52:58) stocks lower , said(#before 2020-03-27 10:52:58) CRU analyst Dina Yu .
