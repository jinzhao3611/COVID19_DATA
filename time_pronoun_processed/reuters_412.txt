2020-05-14 23:46:45 +00:00 .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico on Thursday appeared(#included Thursday) to push(#included Thursday) back by two weeks the date when automotive plants can return(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) to work(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) after the coronavirus lockdown , creating(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) confusion among companies about how soon companies can reconnect(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) supply chains tied(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) to U.S. manufacturing .
Mexico on Wednesday had indicated(#included Wednesday) the sector would start(#included Monday) reopening(#included Monday) on Monday and published(#included Wednesday) advice to that effect in a page in its official gazette .
Mexico later withdrew(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) the page from its official gazette without clarifying(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) whether the page would affect(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) the dates of the restart(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) .
On Thursday , Mexico published(#included Thursday) fresh instructions in its official gazette indicating(#included Thursday) the sector would not reopen(#before June 1) until June 1 .
“ the coronavirus lockdown would be a real crisis(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) for suppliers , ” said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Ann Wilson , senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association , a major U.S. auto parts industry group , referring(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) to the possibility of not being allowed(#included June 1) to resume(#included next week) production(#included next week) next week in Mexico .
Despite the intensifying(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) challenge(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) posed(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) by the pandemic(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) in Mexico , Mexico and auto companies have been pressing(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Mexico to reopen(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) factories quickly because automakers will struggle(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) to operate(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) without parts from south of the border .
Some lawmakers in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ’s ruling(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) MORENA party had publicly expressed(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) concern about a Monday restart(#included Monday) in regions badly hit(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) by the coronavirus outbreak .
The uncertainty follows(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) death figures that show(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Mexico ’s pandemic is still increasing(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) , despite government predictions(#included last week) that the coronavirus outbreak would peak(#included last week) last week .
Tuesday and Wednesday were the two most lethal days in the coronavirus outbreak , with 353 and 294 additional deaths(#included Monday) .
Mexico is now indicating(#included Monday) that companies should use(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) the period between Monday and June 1 to put(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) in place companies safety protocols to mitigate(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) the virus ’ spread .
However , auto industry sources told(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Reuters that talks(#overlap 2020-05-14 23:46:45) are still ongoing between Mexico and automakers and suppliers about when Mexico and automakers and suppliers can resume(#included last week) production(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) .
Industry executives believe(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Mexico may still clarify(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) whether Industry executives can begin(#before June 1) production(#included last week) before June 1 , auto industry sources said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) .
If auto parts plants can not resume(#included last week) next week , automakers would have to halt(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) most production soon after automakers restart(#included last week) in Mexico and could see(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) shortages of key vehicles assembled(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) in Mexico , auto industry sources said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) .
“ the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association , a major U.S. auto parts industry group are seeking(#included last week) clarity about the situation as soon as possible , ” one Mexican industry source said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) .
One major industry body representing Mexican auto part manufacturers said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) One major industry body representing Mexican auto part manufacturers would not adhere(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) to the new date of June 1 and considered(#included June 1) the previous May 18 restart(#included next week) date as having(#included June 1) legal force .
“ One major industry body representing Mexican auto part manufacturers will start(#included PRESENT_REF) to operate(#included PRESENT_REF) according to page 29 of the decree(#included Monday) published(#included Monday) in its official gazette yesterday , ” said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Alberto Bustamante of the National Autoparts Industry lobby group .
General Motors ’ ( GM.N ) pickup plant in Silao is critical to the Detroit company ’s North American operations and had been expected(#included last week) to reopen(#included last week) next week .
“ But just now Alberto Bustamante of the National Autoparts Industry lobby group have just been told(#included Monday) One major industry body representing Mexican auto part manufacturers will not restart(#included PRESENT_REF) until June 1 .
For now One major industry body representing Mexican auto part manufacturers will only be able(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) to use(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) the next weeks to get(#after 2020-05-14 23:46:45) ready to restart(#before June 1) the operation(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) , ” said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) Alberto Bustamante of the National Autoparts Industry lobby group .
A GM spokeswoman , Teresa Cid , said(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) GM had(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) no comment about an official date to restart(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) manufacturing(#before 2020-05-14 23:46:45) operations in Mexico .
