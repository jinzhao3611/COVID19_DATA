Hong Kong No Longer in Top Three IPO Venues .
2020-05-20 09:01:51 +00:00 .
( Bloomberg ) -- Hong Kong is not part of the top three listing(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) venues globally for the first time in six years , as a slow start to 2020 has weighed(#included this year) on initial public offering(#included this year) activity .
Companies have raised(#included this year) only $ 3.2 billion through IPOs in the financial hub this year , putting(#included this year) Hong Kong in fifth place behind exchanges(#included this year) in mainland China and New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Shanghai leads(#included January) the pack , with almost $ 14 billion of IPO proceeds , thanks to Beijing - Shanghai High Speed Railway Co. ’s $ 4.3 billion float in January .
Some $ 11.6 billion was raised(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) through new offerings(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) on the New York Stock Exchange and $ 8.1 billion on the Nasdaq , while Shenzhen sits(#overlap 2020-05-20 09:01:51) in fourth place with $ 3.4 billion .
Hong Kong was the world ’s top listing(#included last year) venue last year , with more than $ 40 billion raised(#included last year) .
Since 2015 , Hong Kong has always been No . 1 , except in 2017 , when Hong Kong ranked(#included 2017) third with $ 16 billion , data compiled by Bloomberg show(#included 2020) .
To be sure , there is still more than half the year to go(#after 2020-05-20 09:01:51) and Shenzhen may well catch(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) up with a spate(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) of larger deals(#after 2020-05-20 09:01:51) lining(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) up , including(#overlap 2020-05-20 09:01:51) second listings by JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc.
IPO activity slowed(#included the end of January) to a trickle after the Lunar New Year holidays at the end of January , as the coronavirus outbreak rattled(#included the end of January) markets and issuers opted(#included last year) to stay(#included this year) on the sidelines .
The biggest deal of 2020 has raised(#included this year) just $ 383 million -- a billion - dollar plus IPO had already come(#included this year) to the market by this time last year .
this year ’s haul is down 36 % from the same period last year .
“ Investors are more risk averse and do n’t want(#overlap 2020-05-20 09:01:51) to place(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) big bets unless Investors already understand(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) a company well , ” said(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) Edward Au , Deloitte ’s co - leader of the national public offering group .
Still , the companies that have listed(#after 2015) since March have proved(#after 2015) incredibly popular with investors , who have rushed(#before 2020-05-20 09:01:51) to back health - care and biotech names amid the coronavirus outbreak .
