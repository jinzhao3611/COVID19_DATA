If you are going(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to be stuck(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) under lockdown , there are worse places to end(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) up than a spacious pub with free beer on tap .

Steve Pond and Dominic Townsend consider(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) Steve Pond and Dominic Townsend lucky to be sharing(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) an apartment above The Prince , a pub they share an apartment above in Stoke Newington , north London .
Like all British pubs , the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) is closed(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) until further notice(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) as part of government measures(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to slow(#after 2020-04-29 08:04:23) the spread of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) .
Inside , chairs are turned(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) upside down on tables , blackboards advertise(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) sporting(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) events long since cancelled(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) and pots and pans gather(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) dust in the kitchen .
“ I moved(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) in just a couple of months before lockdown(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) which has worked(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) out well , considering(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) , ” said(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) Dominic Townsend .
With no crowds to serve(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) , Steve Pond and Dominic Townsend , while away the time playing(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) improvised crazy golf on the wooden floor , taking(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) each other on at chess or cooking(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) barbecues on the roof when the weather is good .
“ We ’ve ended(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) up as friends ...
It ’s been nice(#included April 28 , 2020) .
We ’ve ca n’t complain(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) .
We ’ve got(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) fresh beer on tap , ” Dominic Townsend told(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) Reuters , pouring(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) Steve Pond a pint and placing(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) a pint next to the hand sanitizer on the bar .
For Steve Pond , the epidemic(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) was a major worry(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) early on because Steve Pond has(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) an existing(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) lung condition .
“ So I kind of started(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to self(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) a couple of weeks before , but after confirmation(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) from I doctor I found(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) I could go(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) out so that kind of eased(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) it a bit for I .
“ One of the lows I suppose(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) is not having(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) the locals come(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) in .
It ’s lucky me and Dom get(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) on so well . ”
For all the advantages of me and Dom situation , me and Dom are looking(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) forward to a full house once what seems certain to be the longest lock - in in history finally ends(#included 2020-04-29) .
Some European countries are beginning(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to ease(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) Some European countries lockdowns(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) but Prime Minister Boris Johnson says(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) it is too early to do so in Britain .
“ A big party ; go(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) out to eat(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) somewhere that I miss(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) ; just see(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) your friends , ” Dominic Townsend replied(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) , when asked(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) what Dominic Townsend would like to do most when lockdown was lifted(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) .
“ I think(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) you realise(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) that a lot of the superficial stuff ... now does n’t matter(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) as much .
You want(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to see(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) your friends , you want(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to see(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) your family , you want(#overlap 2020-04-29 08:04:23) to live(#before 2020-04-29 08:04:23) a bit ... once this is done . ”
