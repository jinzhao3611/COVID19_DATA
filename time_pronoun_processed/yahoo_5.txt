Starboard’s Opportunistic Buying(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) Of Commvault .
2020-04-05 20:46:03 +00:00 .
By March 12 , when the SP 500 Index was already down 15 % and lockdowns(#included 2020-03-12) in response(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) to the COVID-19 pandemic were starting(#included 2020-03-12) to become(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) normalized(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) , new activist stakes slowed(#included 2020-03-12) to a minimum .
Excluding(#overlap 2020-04-05 20:46:03) governance - only campaigners and companies below $ 100 million in market - capitalization , there have been just over 20 in the past three weeks – many of just over 20 the result of months or years of work or re - entries , such Starbucks and Chef ’s Warehouse , where activists retreated to what activists know .
Amidst the noise , Starboard Value ’s purchase(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) of a 9.3 % stake in Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) shows(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) what opportunistic buying(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) might look(#after 2020-04-05 20:46:03) like .
Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) was buying(#included 2020-02) call options at the end of February , according to a regulatory filing , but started(#included 2020-03-12) buying(#included 2020-03-12) the data management company ’s shares in earnest as Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) began(#included 2021-03-27) to recover(#included 2021-03-27) from Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) lows after March 18 – stopping(#included 2021-03-27) nine days later .
Starboard Value ’s did not respond(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) to a request(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) for comment(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) .
A Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) spokeswoman would n’t comment(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) on whether Starboard Value ’s had engaged(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) with the board or management team but told(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) me Starboard Value ’s " embraces(#overlap 2020-04-05 20:46:03) open dialogue with our entire shareholder community and will continue(#after 2020-04-05 20:46:03) to act(#after 2020-04-05 20:46:03) in our entire shareholder community best interest .

More Activist Insight Vulnerability had suggested(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) that Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) might soon find(#included PAST_REF) Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) in the crosshairs of an activist again as recently as January , after Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) shrugged(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) off gains(#included 2018) during Elliott ’s time as a major shareholder ( between April 2018 and February 2019 , Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) surrendered(#included 2018-04) two board seats and Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) poison pill ) .
Indeed , Elliott ’s prior involvement(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) may have been part of the appeal(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) .
Companies coming(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) under fire from different dedicated activists at separate times are rare but hardly unheard of , with about 15 instances where the first campaign(#included 2018) started(#included 2018) in 2018 or later , according to Activist Insight Online .
Elliott ’s run at Commvault Systems ( NASDAQ : CVLT ) showed(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) how high the stock could trade(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) and kickstarted(#included 2020-03-12) the refreshment of four out of 11 director spots , including(#included 2020-03-12) a new CEO and chairman .
Operating expenses , one of Elliott key targets , came(#included 2019) down about 2 % in 2019 and were on course(#included 2018-04) for a similar fall this fiscal year , after three quarters .
But that may not be enough(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) for Starboard Value ’s .
The other six directors have(#overlap 2020-04-05 20:46:03) between 12 and 23 years of tenure , according to Activist Insight Online .
Given(#overlap 2020-04-05 20:46:03) that the company ’s nomination(#included 2020) deadline is n’t until March 18 and Starboard Value ’s has kept(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) two proxy contests in play – even justifying(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) two proxy contests with reference to the COVID-19 pandemic – a further board challenge(#after 2020-04-05 20:46:03) is not out of the question .
The challenge(#after 2020-04-05 20:46:03) will be finding(#after 2020-04-05 20:46:03) a remedy , perhaps further incremental change or a sale(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) to private equity .
With that industry apparently focused(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) on existing(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) positions , dealmaking has all but dried(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) up .
Who knows(#overlap 2020-04-05 20:46:03) if it will be back before markets start to shudder(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) from the prospect of a recession(#before 2020-04-05 20:46:03) ?
