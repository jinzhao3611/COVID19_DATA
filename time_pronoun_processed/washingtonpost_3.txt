Analysis | This week’s awful jobs numbers, in perspective .
2020-04-03 20:04:16 +00:00 .
The previous all - time high for one week was 695,000 jobless claims(#included 1982) in 1982 .
In the week tracked(#included 2020-04-03) by Friday ’s jobs numbers , the week ending(#included The following week) March 14 , there were 282,000 claims .
The following(#included The following week) week ?
282,000 claims was 3.3 million .
By last week , 282,000 claims was at 6.6 million .
( Friday ’s jobs numbers are adjusted(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) for seasonal variation(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) , so that we can make(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) historical comparisons ) .
Jobless claims are the only government data(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:04:16) that comes(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) close to keeping(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) pace with the speed of the crisis(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) .
The unemployment - insurance system is at the heart of the government ’s response(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) to the pandemic(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) , so The unemployment - insurance system ’s fitting that The unemployment - insurance system ’s also the leading(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) edge of its data .
But , like The unemployment - insurance system , its data has been flooded(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) beyond recognition .
It no longer makes(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) sense to look(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) at it in the context of previous unemployment - claims filings .
We need(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) to bring(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) in other labor market numbers .
In the chart below , we compare(#after 2020-04-03 20:04:16) it with a few touchstones .
Greater than the Great Recession From January 2008 to February 2010 , the economy lost(#included January 2008) 8,705,000 jobs .
The losses(#included last week) in that two - year period , among the most dismal in U.S. history , were likely eclipsed(#included last week) in the two weeks at the end of March .
Greater than the Trump boom
From November 2016 to February 2020 , the economy added(#included November 2016) about 7,275,000 jobs .
the economy ’s a job - creation record that Trump highlighted early and often , despite it being at roughly the same pace as his predecessor ’s second term .
Unemployment claims numbers indicate(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:04:16) job creation(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) is likely already in negative territory .
Greater than New York
But it ’s hard to grasp(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) abstract milestones like those above , so we also compared(#included late - March) the late - March losses(#included late - March) to local labor markets .
If laid - off Americans were Americans own state right now , Americans ’d be the third - largest , behind California ( 17.61 million ) and Texas ( 13.02 million ) and right ahead of New York ( 9.85 million ) .
They outnumber(#included This week’s) workers in the sixteen least - populated states combined(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) .
Yes , but Unemployment claims at this level are an enormous strain(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:04:16) on The unemployment - insurance system and an unprecedented disruption(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) for millions of U.S. businesses and households , but Unemployment ’s also The unemployment - insurance system working(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:04:16) as intended(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) .
The new stimulus package signed into law last week , the CARES Act , made(#included last week) more people eligible for unemployment insurance and dramatically ramped(#included late - March) up benefits to help(#included last week) workers and businesses survive(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) a prolonged period of distancing(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) .
The goal of The new stimulus package signed into law last week , the CARES Act , should be to keep(#after 2020-04-03 20:04:16) as many workers whole as possible for as long as as many workers ’re home and stop(#after 2020-04-03 20:04:16) the spread of the novel coronavirus , as University of Massachusetts at Amherst economist Arindrajit Dube points(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) out on Twitter .
In normal times , an elevated unemployment claims(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:04:16) number could be an early sign of trouble .
This time , an excruciatingly high number means The unemployment - insurance system is beginning(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:04:16) to help(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) millions of people .
But The unemployment - insurance system nevertheless means pain and disruption(#before 2020-04-03 20:04:16) for millions of Americans and millions of Americans employers .
