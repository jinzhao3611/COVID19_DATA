The measures(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) will be expanded(#after 2020-04-24 03:20:14) to other regions with big outbreaks(#after 2020-04-24 03:20:14) but modified(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) in lower - risk areas , which would see(#after 2020-04-24 03:20:14) a partial resumption(#after 2020-04-24 03:20:14) of work , transport and commerce(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) , Harry Roque told(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) reporters .
Television broadcast(#included 2020-04-03) images on Friday of a crisis(#included 2020-04-03) panel meeting(#included 2020-04-03) where MANILA ( Reuters ) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had made(#included the previous day) the decision late the previous day .
MANILA ( Reuters ) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte even offered(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) a reward of 50 million pesos ( $ 986,000 ) to any Filipino who could create(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) a vaccine .
“ We are all at risk , but do not increase(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) the odds or chances of getting(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) a vaccine , ” MANILA ( Reuters ) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) , warning against complacency .
the capital Manila , accounts(#overlap 2020-04-24 03:20:14) for more than two - thirds of the country ’s 6,981 infections and 462 deaths(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) .
After China and Italy , but just a few days before Spain , Philippines became(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) the third country to order(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) tight lockdown(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) and home quarantine(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) , even though Philippines had(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) only a fraction of the infections and deaths(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) of nations that took(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) similar measures .
Philippines introduced(#included March 12) curbs on immigration , travel , commerce , gatherings on March 12 , five days after the first case of domestic transmission , and expanded(#included March 16) on March 16 .
It is closed(#overlap 2020-04-24 03:20:14) to all except repatriated(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) Filipinos .
The approach aims(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) to keep(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) overstretched health services from from being overwhelmed(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) and create(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) a window to ramp up testing(#before May 15) , which started(#included recent weeks) slowly to gain(#included recent weeks) ground in recent weeks .
But with just 72,000 tests(#included the previous day) , Philippines last week estimated(#included March 12) Philippines had managed(#included the previous day) to track(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) only a quarter of projected(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) infections .
The health ministry has said(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) it was too early to say(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) if the infection curve had been flattened(#before 2020-04-24 03:20:14) .
