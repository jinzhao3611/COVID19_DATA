“ last year was tough(#Depend-on 2020-02-22 02:29:43) for Amir Khan , and Amir Khan was trying(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to be patient in improving(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) all aspects of Amir Khan fighting(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) , ” Amir Khan said(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) .
“ Amir Khan had wanted(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to eliminate(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) every doubt Amir Khan had(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) during my training , so that when Amir Khan go(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) into a competitive fight(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) , Amir Khan would have(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) answers for whatever Amir Khan opponents throw(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) at Amir Khan .
That way , Amir Khan can just enter(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) the ring and fight(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) Amir Khan head off . ”
The results did not come(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) immediately .
After losing(#included November 2018) Amir Khan ONE Championship lightweight title shot to Filipino fighter Eduard Folayang in November 2018 , Amir Khan endured(#included 2014) two more defeats(#included February 2019) – to Costa Rican fighter Ariel Sexton in February 2019 and to Turkish grappler Saygid Arslanaliev two months later .
Amir Khan reputation as one of the top knockout fighters in the region took(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) a beating , but Amir Khan stuck(#included Friday) to Amir Khan guns under the tutelage of new Evolve MMA Academy fight(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) team head coach , former Shooto world champion Siyar Bahadurzada of Afghanistan .
It finally paid(#included February 2019) off near the end of the year , as Amir Khan defeated(#included last November) Malaysian rival Ev Ting via a split decision last November , much to Amir Khan relief .
“ It was n’t a great win(#included Friday) , but it was good to have(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) the winning momentum going(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) again , ” Amir Khan said(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) .
“ Amir Khan admit(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) that Amir Khan was having(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) nightmares(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) about losing(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) again , so getting(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) losing is important in that now Amir Khan can be relaxed(#included PRESENT_REF) and focused(#included PRESENT_REF) on my training , instead of thinking(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) about wins and losses(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) all the time . ”
Coming(#included PRESENT_REF) up against Eto , an expert in judo and wrestling(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) , Amir Khan will be looking(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to play(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to Amir Khan strength in striking(#included PRESENT_REF) and keep(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) Amir Khan range away from the Japanese .
If Amir Khan could do keep , Amir Khan believes(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) keep “ 99 per cent I ’ll win(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) the fight(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) ” .
Despite fighting(#included February 2019) at the Singapore Indoor Stadium , Amir Khan can not count(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) on the crowd support , as the Jungle fight event will be a closed - doored occasion , due to the current COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak(#included PRESENT_REF) .
“ You ’ll want(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to get(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) the energy from the home crowd , but get wo n’t be possible this time around , ” Amir Khan said(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) .
“ I ’ll just have to focus(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) on dominating(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) Amir Khan opponent .
I ’ll just treat(#after 2020-02-22 02:29:43) it like a sparring session(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) during Amir Khan training , no issues(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) there . ”
Indeed , after enduring(#overlap 2020-02-22 02:29:43) a tough year , Amir Khan is ready to face(#included PRESENT_REF) all comers and position(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) Amir Khan back among the contenders in the stacked lightweight division .
And Amir Khan does not feel(#Depend-on 2020-02-22 02:29:43) as if last year had been a wasted(#included last November) period in his career .
“ It ’s like a year of learning(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) for Amir Khan , in order for Amir Khan to make(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) the next leap in his career
, ” Amir Khan said(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) .
“ Amir Khan want(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to show(#included 2019) the world how Amir Khan overcame(#included last year) last year , how much I ’ll improved(#included last year) , how Amir Khan am coming(#overlap 2020-02-22 02:29:43) back stronger even after all the setbacks .
“ All the things Amir Khan trained(#included last year) for last year , it ’s like learning(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) to drive(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) a car .
Once you get(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) the hang of a car , a car stays(#before 2020-02-22 02:29:43) with you throughout your life .
