Cork racecourse will become(#included Thursday morning) a testing(#included Thursday morning) centre for coronavirus from Thursday morning as Irish racing lends(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) Irish racing support to government efforts to stop(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) the spread of coronavirus , following(#before April 19) the suspension of all racing(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) in Ireland until at least April 19 .
Horse Racing Ireland , which was forced to abandon its programme of staging race meetings behind closed doors on Tuesday by new government restrictions on sporting events , also said(#included Wednesday) in a statement(#included Wednesday) on Wednesday that Horse Racing Ireland , which was forced to abandon its programme of staging race meetings behind closed doors on Tuesday by new government restrictions on sporting events , is “ working(#included Wednesday) … to identify(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) other elements of racing(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) ’s personnel and infrastructure that could be used(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) in the co(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) - ordinated reaction to the crisis . ”
However , Horse Racing Ireland , which was forced to abandon its programme of staging race meetings behind closed doors on Tuesday by new government restrictions on sporting events , also warned(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) of the “ potentially catastrophic impact(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) of a sustained period without racing(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) on all sectors of the industry ” , and suggested(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) that Horse Racing Ireland , which was forced to abandon its programme of staging race meetings behind closed doors on Tuesday by new government restrictions on sporting events , will look(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) to return(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) to racing(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) behind closed doors at the earliest opportunity .
Cork racecourse , is about 30 miles from Cork , Ireland ’s second - largest city after Dublin with a population of nearly 200,000 people .
Croke Park in Dublin , the 82,000 - seat headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association , opened(#included last week) a Covid-19 testing(#included last week) centre last week , and more tracks seems(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) likely to follow(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) Cork ’s lead in Ireland .
“ What is most important is that as a country , we do all we can individually and collectively to fight(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) the transmission of Covid-19 and focus(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) on our health , ” Nicky Hartery , the the Gaelic Athletic Association chairman , said(#included Wednesday) after a meeting(#included Wednesday) of the organisation ’s board on Wednesday , “ ensuring(#included Wednesday) that resources such as medical facilities and personnel are allocated where the need is most . ”
Wednesday ’s board meeting(#included Tuesday) also reviewed(#included Tuesday) 10 racing(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) fixtures which had been held(#included last week) behind closed doors over the last fortnight and concluded(#included Tuesday) that “ this experience has confirmed(#included Thursday morning) that a safe environment which fully respects(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) required social distancing and hygiene measures(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) is achievable(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) for race fixtures ” .
A return(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) to some form of racing programme , even if some form of racing programme is under the severe restrictions(#included earlier this week) which were in place at meetings earlier this week , is now one of Cork ’s key priorities .
“ Similar to most industries , the racing(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) and breeding sector will have to look(#included Thursday morning) forward now , ” Brian Kavanagh , Cork ’s chief executive , said(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) .
“ Cork ’s will continue(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) Cork ’s engagement(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) with government around the supporters that are available for the many people in our industry who have now lost their jobs and whose earning capacity has dramatically reduced .
Racing and breeding supports(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) almost 29,000 FTEs [ full - time employments ] mostly in rural Ireland and a sustained period without racing(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) impacts(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) thousands of almost 29,000 FTEs [ full - time employments ] .
“ When racing went(#included last week) behind closed doors , many staff , including(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) bookmakers , Tote staff , catering staff and other racecourse service providers stopped(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) earning(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) .
As of yesterday ’s stoppage , many others , including(#before 2020-03-25 17:45:32) jockeys , trainers , stable staff , media and many other service providers joined(#included Wednesday) stopped .
Supports will be necessary for each of these areas , and Horse Racing Ireland , which was forced to abandon its programme of staging race meetings behind closed doors on Tuesday by new government restrictions on sporting events , will work(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) with all parties to achieve(#after 2020-03-25 17:45:32) this . ”
The suspension of racing(#before April 19) in Ireland until at least 19 April means that the popular Irish Grand National Festival at Fairyhouse over the Easter weekend has definitely been lost(#included Thursday morning) , but leaves(#overlap 2020-03-25 17:45:32) at least a glimmer of hope that the popular Irish Grand National Festival at Fairyhouse over the Easter weekend , could be saved in some form .
