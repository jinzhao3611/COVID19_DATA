Xi Jinping has called(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) for an overhaul(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) of China ’s public health system , which has been criticised(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) for being ill - prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic that claimed more than 4,600 lives in the country .
In a meeting(#included Friday) with delegates to the national legislature from Hubei , the country ’s worst - hit province , Xi Jinping said(#included Friday) addressing(#included Friday) and preventing(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:40:11) epidemics(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) and other public health crises was a matter of national security and a systematic effort was needed(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) to improve(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) shortcomings , such as epidemic monitoring and warning systems , state media reported on Sunday .
On Friday Premier Li Keqiang said(#included Friday) in Premier Li Keqiang annual government report that reforming(#included Friday) the country ’s disease prevention and control system would be high on the leadership ’s agenda this year , alongside other challenges including(#included 2003) reviving(#included 2003) the economy amid the global recession(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) triggered(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) by the Covid-19 pandemic that claimed more than 4,600 lives in the country .
the Covid-19 pandemic that claimed more than 4,600 lives in the country has laid(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) bare many problems with China ’s disease prevention(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:40:11) and control system , which was modelled(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) on China US counterpart and refined(#included 2003) in the aftermath of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak .
These problems included(#included late last year) a lack of funding , understaffing in local offices and an inefficient public health reporting system that hampered(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) the response(#included 2003) when the first reports(#included late last year) of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak emerged(#included late last year) in Wuhan , the provincial capital of Hubei , late last year .
One key problem was that the national Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was powerless to inform(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) the public about a potential pandemic(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) .
Xi ’s speech did not outline(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) specific measures(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) but called(#included Friday) for the country ’s disease prevention and control system to be strengthened(#after 2020-05-24 23:40:11) , with solid grass - roots foundations and a stronger role for lower - level medical institutions such as township health centres .
Xi ’s also said(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) China should establish(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) an “ intelligent multi - point ” trigger mechanism to improve(#after 2020-05-24 23:40:11) the monitoring and early warning systems .
Xi ’s also wanted(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) to improve(#after 2020-05-24 23:40:11) “ basic conditions ” in the country ’s disease prevention and control system and set(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) up a training system to enhance(#included 2003) front - line workers ’ “ sense of honour and mission ” .
“ Prevention is the most economical and effective health strategy , ” Xi Jinping said(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) .
“ We must adhere(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) to prevention as We launch(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) a patriotic health campaign(#after 2020-05-24 23:40:11) in the new era . ”
Xi Jinping also suggested(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) that some lifestyle measures(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) adopted(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) during the Covid-19 pandemic that claimed more than 4,600 lives in the country should continue(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) , such as using(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) separate chopsticks for serving(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:40:11) and eating(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) food , better waste collection systems and the use of masks and social distancing to stop(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) the spread of infections .
Xi Jinping also described(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) Wuhan , the provincial capital of Hubei as a “ heroic city ” that had made(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) considerable sacrifices to fight(#before 2020-05-24 23:40:11) the Covid-19 pandemic that claimed more than 4,600 lives in the country .
