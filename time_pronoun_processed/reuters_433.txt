HONG KONG , May 7 ( Reuters ) -
3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li will step(#included October next year) down as head of the Hong Kong stock exchange by October next year , HONG KONG said(#included Thursday) on Thursday , kick(#included Thursday) starting(#included Thursday) a search for a successor with 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li ability to balance(#after 2020-05-07 13:27:31) the wishes of international institutions , local players and Beijing .
Dubbed(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) by some as Mr China , the boss of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) built(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) ties with Chinese mainland markets , attracted(#included 2012) major companies to HONG KONG and oversaw(#included 2012) the 2012 acquisition(#included 2012) of the London Metal Exchange , though last year ’s failed bid(#included 2019) for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE ) removed some of the gloss from 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li 10 - year reign .
The decision(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) to flag(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li planned(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) departure(#included 2012) was unrelated(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) to the failed(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) $ 39 billion LSE bid(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) , 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li said(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) as Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) reported(#included May 7) a 13 % drop in first - quarter net profit , underperforming(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) rival Asian exchanges(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) after investment losses(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) outweighed(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) higher trading(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) fees .
New listings and the 2014 launch(#included 2012) of Stock Connect , which links(#included 2012) Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses , have provided(#included 2012) a hefty boost to trading(#included 2012) on the Hong Kong stock exchange during last year ’s tenure , though volumes were dented(#included 2019) by the anti - government protests(#included 2019) in Hong Kong last year .
The pace of reforms(#included 2014) has also slowed(#included 2014) in recent years , with plans for other China - linked products including(#included 2014) derivatives based(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) on onshore Chinese shares seemingly stalled(#included 2014) .
One of the longest serving(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) exchange(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) CEOs globally , 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li is well known(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) for 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li colourful metaphors , comparing(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) HONG KONG to everything from a wolf pack to a poorly armed traffic cop .
3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li described(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) HKEX ’s bid(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) for LSE as a “ a corporate tale of Romeo and Juliet ” .
last year 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li netted(#included 2019) about $ 21.4 million by selling(#included 2019) roughly half of 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) shares .
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) said(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li would step(#included 2014) down from as CEO in Oct 2021 , at the end of 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li current term , or earlier if a successor is appointed(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) before then .
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) has appointed(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) a committee to find(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) 3-Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Li successor , Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) said(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) .
CHALLENGES AHEAD
last year ’s departure(#included Last year) , however , raises(#overlap 2020-05-07 13:27:31) questions around succession planning(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) ’s strategic direction , Citi analyst Tian Yafei wrote(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) in a research note .
“ However , should a new CEO who could build(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) long term goodwill with mainland regulators be appointed(#included 2014) , some of the pending initiatives could be approved(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) , ” Citi analyst Tian Yafei added(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) , referring(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) to the previously planned(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) reforms(#included recent years) .
The company ’s first - quarter profit fall(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) is in contrast(#included recent years) to results(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) from rivals including(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) the Hong Kong stock exchange .
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ( HKEX ) ’s net profit dropped(#included Last year) to HK$2.26 billion ( $ 291.6 million ) even as headline average daily trading(#included Last year) turnover jumped(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) 20 % amid high market volatility triggered(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) by the coronavirus pandemic , pushing(#included Last year) up trading(#included Last year) fee income by 45 % .
The gains(#included Last year) , however , were outweighed(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) by a HK$47 million loss(#included a year earlier) on investments(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) , compared(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) with gains(#included Oct 2021) of HK$882 million a year earlier , hit(#included next year) by a market rout as the coronavirus pandemic spread .
Stock Connect achieved(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) record turnover in the first three months of the year in terms of international investors buying(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) mainland China - listed shares and mainland investors buying(#before 2020-05-07 13:27:31) Hong Kong - listed shares .
