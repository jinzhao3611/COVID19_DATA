The three - Test series between England and West Indies in June has been postponed(#included 2020-06) due to the coronavirus outbreak(#included 2020-06) , Cricket West Indies ( CWI ) said(#included Friday) on Friday .
West Indies had been scheduled(#included 4) to play(#included 4) on 4 - 8 June at The Oval , 12 - 16 June at Edgbaston and 25 - 29 June at Lord ’s .
postponed came(#included 2020-06) as the result of the uncertainty surrounding(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) the safe resumption(#overlap 2020-04-24 22:50:43) of the sport in Britain as well as international air travel(#overlap 2020-04-24 22:50:43) .
“ West Indies continue(#overlap 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to be in regular dialogue(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) with Cricket West Indies ( CWI ) on when and how West Indies might be able to rearrange(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) The three - Test series between England and West Indies in June , ” said(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) the Cricket West Indies ( CWI ) chief executive , Johnny Grave .
“ Clearly playing(#included 2020-06) in June is now not possible and West Indies will continue(#included 2020-06) West Indies discussions(#included 2020-06) with Cricket West Indies ( CWI ) and other Internationals Boards on trying(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to find(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) new dates .
West Indies will only travel(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to England to play(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) The three - Test series between England and West Indies in June if West Indies players can be assured(#overlap 2020-04-24 22:50:43) that it is safe to do so . ”
Cricket West Indies ( CWI ) said(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) the proposed window for the staging of The three - Test series between England and West Indies in June is now July until the end of September .
The prospect of the inaugural World Test Championship ( WTC ) final(#included 25) taking(#included 25) place in 2021 will hinge(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) on whether England can salvage(#included 2020-06) a cricket season this year and get(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) England home series against Pakistan played(#after 2020-04-24 22:50:43) .
The nine teams in the WTC need(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to have played(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) six series apiece by the time the top two – currently India and Australia – play(#included 25) off for the trophy at Lord ’s in June 2021 and , though a number are already starting(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to be postponed(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) , the southern hemisphere summer later in this year offers(#included 2020-06) an outside chance of playing catch - up .
Joe Root ’s England side have played(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) two series but are already in arrears after the West Indies postponement(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) and after Test tour of England was abandoned(#included 2020-06) in March .
Should England side fail(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to host(#before 2020-04-24 22:50:43) Pakistan , all three series would need(#Depend-on 2020-04-24 22:50:43) to be played(#included 2020-06) on the road next winter , on top of a five - Test visit(#included 2020-06) to India from January .
