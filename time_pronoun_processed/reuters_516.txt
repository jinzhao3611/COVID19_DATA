For now , REUTERS / Abubaker Lubowa biggest problem is loneliness .
But soon it may be food - cash at a conservation centre in Uganda is running(#after 2020-04-23 14:27:35) out after the global travel(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) freeze and lockdowns(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) caused(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) by the outbreak(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) .
“ We are closed(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) to the public , ” the centre ’s executive director , James Musinguzi , told(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) Reuters .
“ No more money is coming(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) in . ”
Zoos and conservation projects around the world are grappling(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) with dwindling(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) funds after tourists disappeared(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) .
Kenyan conservationists are reining(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) in programmes(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) , and in Germany a zoo warned(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) Kenyan conservationists might have to feed(#after 2020-04-23 14:27:35) animals to each other if funding dried(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) up .
In Uganda , the publicly - owned Uganda Wildlife Education Centre ( UWEC ) sits(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) on 74 hectares of woods near the town of Entebbe , on a picturesque peninsula on Lake Victoria .
a conservation centre in Uganda runs(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) entirely on cash from visitors .
Last year , a conservation centre in Uganda welcomed(#included Last year) 385,000 people , but visitor numbers began(#included January) dropping(#included January) in January and a conservation centre in Uganda shut(#included March 27) on March 27 .
Three days later , Uganda imposed(#included Last year) one of the continent ’s strictest lockdowns to slow(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) the spread of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) .
one of the continent ’s strictest lockdowns was extended(#included April 14) for an extra three weeks on April 14 .
So far , it seems(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) to be working(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) : Uganda has only recorded(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) 58 infections of COVID-19 , the disease caused(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) by the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) .
There have been no reported(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) deaths(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) .
But people - and animals - are suffering(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) .
the centre ’s executive director , James Musinguzi estimates(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) a conservation centre in Uganda can only keep(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) going for another two months .
Nyakato alone drinks(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) 12 litres of baby formula a day , drinking(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) greedily when caretaker Onesmus Mutuza , 25 , thrusts(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) a feeding bottle into caretaker Onesmus Mutuza , 25 mouth and squeezes(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) .
12 litres of baby formula costs(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) 7.2 million shillings ( $ 1,900 ) per month .
There are other animals to worry(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) about .
a conservation centre in Uganda is home(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) to 280 animals including(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) birds , primates , reptiles , and large mammals like rhinos .
Even if one of the continent ’s strictest lockdowns ends(#included 2020-04-23) soon , global travel and tourism are likely to take(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) time to recover(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) .
So a conservation centre in Uganda has introduced(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) “ virtual tours(#overlap 2020-04-23 14:27:35) ” via Facebook , hoping(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) to attract(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) supporters .
Not everyone is gloomy , though .
Some animals have been enjoying(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) Some animals privacy .
Earlier this year , Kabira , a 23 - year - old female white southern rhino finally mated(#included Earlier this year) with Sherino after a frustrating wait of more than two decades .
Now caretaker Steven Busulwa is eagerly awaiting(#included June) a pregnancy test due in June .
“ In one year and a half maybe we might have(#after 2020-04-23 14:27:35) some babies , ” caretaker Steven Busulwa said(#before 2020-04-23 14:27:35) , hopefully .
