Global benchmark oil prices are expected(#included 2020-03-30) to open(#included 2020-03-30) lower on Monday as a dispute(#included 2020-W14) between top crude exporters Russia and Saudi Arabia raises(#overlap 2020-04-05 13:09:55) concerns(#included 2020-W14) of another collapse(#included 2020-W14) in talks to curb production at a meeting this week .

Crude futures surged(#included 2020-04-03) for a second day on Friday , with both U.S. and Brent contracts posting(#included 2020-04-03) both U.S. and Brent contracts largest weekly percentage gains(#included 2020-04-03) on record due to hopes that a global deal to cut(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) crude supply worldwide would be struck(#included 2020-04-09) at talks to curb production at a meeting this week .
The sharp rebound(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) from weeks of losses(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) came(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) after U.S. President Donald Trump said(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) both U.S. and Brent contracts would negotiate(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) to end(#included 2020-04-04) a price war(#included 2019-11-24) that slashed(#included 2020-04-03) prices by more than half last month .
“ Given the slimmer chances of a deal , prices are likely to give(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) up the gains(#included 2020-04-04) made(#included 2020-04-03) last month that were a short - covering rally induced(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) by Putin ’s comments(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) , ” said(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) Amrita Sen , co - founder of the Energy Aspects consultancy .
OPEC and its allies are working(#overlap 2020-04-05 13:09:55) on a global agreement(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) for an unprecedented oil production(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) cut(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) equivalent to around 10 % of worldwide supply in what OPEC and its allies expect(#overlap 2020-04-05 13:09:55) to be a global effort including(#overlap 2020-04-05 13:09:55) countries that do not exert(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) state control over output , such as the United States .
U.S. President Donald Trump has , however , made(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) no commitment to take(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) the extraordinary step of persuading(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) U.S. companies to cut(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) output .
Per Magnus Nysveen , head of analysis at Rystad Energy , said(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) the decline(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) in global demand due to the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) and the global lockdowns(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) was larger than the proposed cuts by the OPEC+ alliance .
“ It is not strange for the market to hike(#included 2020-04-09) prices by enthusiasm such as Friday ’s , but for the levels to stay(#included 2020-04-09) stable for more than a day or two , the market takes(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) concrete developments(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) and deals(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) on the ground , ” Per Magnus Nysveen , head of analysis at Rystad Energy , said(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) .
On Friday , Brent crude futures rose(#included 2020-04-03) 13.9 % , or $ 4.17 a barrel , to settle(#included 2020-04-03) at $ 34.11 .
U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude CLc1 rose(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) $ 3.02 , or 11.93 % to settle(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) at $ 28.34 .
OPEC and its allies postponed(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) an emergency meeting , led by Saudi Arabia , where the oil cuts could be agreed upon .
A senior Saudi source told(#included 2020-04-05) Reuters on Sunday , that Saudi Arabia would host(#included 2020-04-09) an emergency meeting , led by Saudi Arabia , where the oil cuts could be agreed upon via video conference(#included 2020-04-09) on April 9 and the delay was to allow(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) more time to bring(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) other producers on board .
Saudi Arabia will delay(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) the release(#included 2020-04-09) of Saudi Arabia crude official selling(#included 2020-04-09) prices ( OSP ) for May until April 10 to wait(#included 2020-04-09) for the outcome of a meeting(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) between OPEC and its allies regarding(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) possible output cuts , A senior Saudi source said(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) .
“ As Saudi Arabia seems(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) to have postponed(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) the release of Saudi Arabia official selling(#included 2020-05) prices for May , it seems(#overlap 2020-04-05 13:09:55) Saudi Arabia still believes(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) an oil production cut deal is possible , ” said(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) UBS commodities analyst Giovanni Staunovo .
“ The biggest challenge(#overlap 2020-04-05 13:09:55) remains how to split(#after 2020-04-05 13:09:55) up possible output cuts among producers , particularly if U.S. oil producers will not join(#before 2020-04-05 13:09:55) with voluntary cuts . ”
