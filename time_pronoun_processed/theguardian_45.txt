2020-03-23 20:56:32 +00:00 .
Boris Johnson will order(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) police to enforce(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) a strict coronavirus lockdown , with a ban(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) on gatherings of more than two people and strict limits on exercise , as Boris Johnson told(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the British public : “ You must stay(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) at home . ”
Boris Johnson ratcheted(#included Monday evening) up Britain ’s response(#included Monday evening) with an address to the nation on Monday evening , warning(#included Monday evening) that people will only be allowed(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) outside to buy(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) food or medication , exercise(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) alone once a day , or to travel(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) to work(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) if absolutely necessary .
All non - essential shops will close(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) with immediate affect , as will playgrounds and libraries , Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) in an address to the nation on Monday evening .
After days of being accused(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) of sending(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) mixed messages about what the public should do , Boris Johnson significantly escalated(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) Boris Johnson language as Boris Johnson urged(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) people to comply(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) with the new , more stringent measures(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) .
“ You should not be meeting(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) friends .
If your friends ask(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) you to meet(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) , you should say(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) No .
You should not be meeting(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) family members who do not live(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) in your home .
You should not be going(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) shopping except for essentials like food and medicine – and you should do going as little as you can , ” Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) .
“ If you do n’t follow(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the rules the police will have(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the powers to enforce(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the rules , including(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) through fines(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) and dispersing(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) gatherings . ”
The decision follows(#included Friday) Friday ’s announcement(#included Friday) that all pubs , restaurants and gyms should shut(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) down .
The decision came(#included 2020-03-30) after commuters packed(#included 2020-03-30) on to trains on Monday , and sun - seekers crowded(#included 2020-03-30) into parks over the weekend .
After weeks of being reluctant(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) to copy(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) draconian measures(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) seen(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) elsewhere in Europe , Boris Johnson announced(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) The decision having come(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) under pressure from Boris Johnson own cabinet and Tory backbenchers as well as Labour .
“ In this fight(#included PRESENT_REF) we can be in no doubt(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) that each and every one of we is directly enlisted(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) .
Each and every one of we is now obliged(#included PRESENT_REF) to join(#included PRESENT_REF) together .
To halt(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the spread of this disease .
To protect(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) our NHS and to save(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) many many thousands of lives , ” Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) .
“ And Boris Johnson know(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) that as they have(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) in the past so many times , the people of this country will rise(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) to that challenge .
And the people of this country will come(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) through that challenge stronger than ever . ”
It is understood(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) that Boris Johnson had until now been holding(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) out against a lockdown(#before PRESENT_REF) , with senior advisers such as Dominic Cummings having pushed(#included the last week) for tougher measures in the last week , after initially backing(#included the last week) a more relaxed(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) approach(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) .
In the past few days , there had been concern(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) about announcing(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) a lockdown(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) before police have(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the proper powers to enforce(#included later) one – which will only come(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) into law with the emergency coronavirus legislation later in the last week .
However , Boris Johnson has been pressured(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) into action by the scale of worry(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) in Boris Johnson own party and signs that the UK ’s deaths(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) from coronavirus are following(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the same pattern as Italy with a two - week lag .
The total confirmed(#included 2020-03-30) death(#included 2020-03-30) toll(#included last week) rose(#included 2020-03-30) to 335 on Monday – a sixfold increase(#included last week) on this time last week .
“ Without a huge national effort to halt(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the growth(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) of this disease , there will come(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) ; because there wo n’t be enough ventilators , enough intensive care beds , enough doctors and nurses , ” Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) .
“ And as we have seen(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) elsewhere , in other countries that also have(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) fantastic health care systems , that is the moment of real danger .
To put(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) it simply , if too many people become(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) seriously unwell at one time , our NHS will be unable to handle(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) become - meaning(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:56:32) more people are likely to die(#after 2020-03-23 20:56:32) , not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well .
So it ’s vital to slow(#before 2020-03-23 20:56:32) the spread of this disease . ”
