“ Donald Trump ’s Donald Trump , and I would rather Donald Trump not be taking(#before 2020-05-21 10:33:28) something that has not been approved(#before 2020-05-21 10:33:28) by the scientists , ” Nancy Pelosi said(#included 2020-03-31) .

Therefore under these terms , Mr Trump ’s BMI does not classify(#before 2020-05-21 10:33:28) as morbidly obese .
However , during Mr Trump ’s BMI time as president , Mr Trump ’s BMI health has long been a subject(#before 2020-05-21 10:33:28) of debate(#before 2020-05-21 10:33:28) and controversy(#before 2020-05-21 10:33:28) .

Press secretary Stephanie Grisham condemned(#included 2020-03-31) speculation about the hospital visit as “ irresponsible and dangerous for the country ” .
