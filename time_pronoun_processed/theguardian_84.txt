A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California was scheduled(#included Wednesday night) to arrive(#included Wednesday night) in San Francisco on Wednesday night , but officials requested(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) that A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California delay(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California return(#included Wednesday night) while the US coast guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coordinated(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) testing(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) .
The plan was for A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California to remain(#included 21 February) in international waters off coast of San Francisco while a helicopter flew(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) tests(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) on board and then returned(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) the samples to a laboratory for testing(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) .
In addition to the 21 people reporting(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) flu - like symptoms , officials planned(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) to test(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) the 62 passengers from the Mexico trip who remained on board for the Hawaii journey , as well as an unknown number of crew .

By one estimate(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) , more than 50 % of the 62 passengers from the Mexico trip who remained on board for the Hawaii journey , as well as an unknown number of crew were Californians , Gavin Newsom , California ’s governor , said(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) , not including(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) the 62 passengers from the Mexico trip who remained on board for the Hawaii journey , as well as an unknown number of crew .
In total the US coast guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:01:18) to track(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) down about 2,500 people throughout California who disembarked(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) from A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California and could be at risk .
track was one of the factors(#included Wednesday) that prompted(#included Wednesday) Gavin Newsom , California ’s governor , to declare(#included Wednesday) a state of emergency(#included Wednesday) in California on Wednesday .
“ There ’s a number of people we ’re monitoring(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:01:18) , ” Gavin Newsom , California ’s governor , said(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) .
“ We ’re going(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) through that manifest and obviously the concern around people being on a tour(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) that all travel(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:01:18) together , not just on A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California , but were also transported(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) together , highlights(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:01:18) the need to focus with more acuity on those who may have been in closer contact(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) with the individual who tragically passed(#included Wednesday) away . ”
It is still unclear(#before 2020-03-05 04:01:18) whether the 62 passengers from the Mexico trip who remained on board for the Hawaii journey , as well as an unknown number of crew will be forced(#after 2020-03-05 04:01:18) to remain(#after 2020-03-05 04:01:18) on board like the 62 passengers from the Mexico trip who remained on board for the Hawaii journey , as well as an unknown number of crew .
