Tiger Roll avatar(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) foiled(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) as Potters Corner triumphs(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) in Virtual Grand National .
2020-04-04 17:13:37 +00:00 .
Potters Corner won(#included 2019-12) ’ the Virtual Grand National , a computer simulation(#included Saturday evening) broadcast(#included Saturday evening) by ITV on Saturday evening in place of the race itself , which has been abandoned(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) along with the rest of the current sporting(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) programme in Britain because of the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) .
Tiger Roll , who would have been seeking his third consecutive Grand National success if this year ’s race had gone ahead , was placed(#included Saturday evening) fourth by ITV ’s computer .
The outcome must count(#after 2020-04-04 17:13:37) as a bittersweet moment for the trainer Christian Williams , who had nursed serious hopes for Potters Corner at Aintree after he won the Welsh Grand National in December .
Like all other jumps(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) horses , Potters Corner will not see(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) real action until at least July , jump racing(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) having been suspended(#before 2020-07) until then by the sport ’s ruling body .
ITV hailed(#included Saturday evening) The outcome as a great moment for the young jockey Jack Tudor , who , in reality , would have needed(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) to ride(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) a few more winners after racing(#included 18) was suspended(#included mid - March) in mid - March to qualify(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) for a place in Virtual Grand National .
Walk In The Mill was second(#Depend-on 2020-04-04 17:13:37) and Any Second Now third .
Earlier , Manifesto was pipped(#included 2020-03-16) close home by Red Rum in ITV ’s ‘ Race of Champions ’ , contested(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) by past Virtual Grand National winners , some from the 19th century .
Virtual Grand National was cancelled(#included 2019-12) , along with the rest of the traditional three days of racing(#included 2020-03-17) at Aintree , on 16 March , when the Jockey Club decided(#included Saturday evening) the Jockey Club could not hope(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) to stage(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) Virtual Grand National in light of government advice against non - essential travel(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) and social contact .
Until then , it had still seemed(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) possible to stage(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) Virtual Grand National behind closed doors , but all horse racing(#included 2020-03-17) was brought(#included 2020-03-17) to a halt(#included 2020-03-17) the following(#Depend-on 2020-03-16) day .
While a computerised Grand National is a poor substitute for the real thing , the enormous effort at accuracy made(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) by a computerised Grand National programmers has rewarded(#included 2020-03-17) Virtual Grand National with some quite prescient results in the past three years .
Cause Of Causes , the first ‘ virtual ’ winner in 2017 , was actually second in Virtual Grand National the next day , while the computer accurately predicted(#included 2020-03-17) Tiger Roll ’s first success the next year .
Rathvinden , the virtual winner of 2019 , then finished(#included 18) third in the real thing .
Betting was allowed(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) on Virtual Grand National , with punters limited(#included 2020-03-16) to £ 10 stakes , while bookmakers agreed(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) to offer(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) the same set of odds as each other and promised(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) to pass(#after 2020-04-04 17:13:37) any profit to NHS Charities Together , the umbrella organisation for more than 140 NHS charities .
Meanwhile , the Jockey Club said(#before 2020-04-04 17:13:37) the Jockey Club would donate(#included 2017) 10,000 tickets to the first day of next year ’s Virtual Grand National meeting(#after 2020-04-04 17:13:37) to NHS and social care workers across Merseyside .
