Kim Jong-un last appeared(#included April 11) publicly on April 11 .
Speculation about his health — and about who would take(#after 2020-05-01 23:00:17) over the hermetic country with a nuclear arsenal should Kim Jong-un become(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) incapacitated(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) or die(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) — began(#included Friday) swirling(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) after Kim Jong-un missed(#included April 15) the state celebrations(#included April 15) of his country ’s biggest holiday on April 15 .
On that day his country marks(#included Saturday) the birthday of Kim Jong-un .
The rumors had subsequently gone(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) into overdrive(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) , claiming(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) that Kim Jong-un was “ in grave danger , ” in a “ vegetative state ” after botched(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) heart - valve surgery , or in quarantine(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) after contracting(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) Covid-19 .
Other reports said(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) that his country had sent(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) doctors to North Korea to save(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) Kim Jong-un .
While reporting(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) Kim Jong-un ’s reappearance(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) , the North ’s state news agency did not carry(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) any photos of Kim Jong-un , as the North ’s state news agency usually has in Kim Jong-un past public appearances .
The lack of photographic evidence may keep(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) the rumor mill churning(#overlap 2020-05-01 23:00:17) over what physical condition Kim Jong-un is in .
the North ’s state news agency said(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) Kim Jong-un cut(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) the ribbon at a completed fertilizer factory .
“ All the participants again burst(#included Friday) into thunderous cheers(#included April 11) of ‘ hurrah ! ’ ”
the North ’s state news agency said(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) .
reported said(#included Friday) that Kim Jong-un warmly acknowledged(#included Friday) the builders and masses raising(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) thunderous cheers ” and looked(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) around a completed fertilizer factory , accompanied(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) by senior Workers ’ Party officials , including(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) his only sister , Kim Yo - jong , reported said(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) .
North Korea did not immediately comment(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) on reported , but North Korea has pushed(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) back against recent speculation that Kim Jong-un was in poor health .
his only sister , Kim Yo - jong , had called(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) reported “ fake news , ” saying(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) that South Korea could say(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) “ confidently ” that there was no evidence to confirm(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) rumors that Kim Jong-un was gravely ill .
Amid reported , North Korea had continued(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) to send(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) out letters and gifts to foreign leaders and domestic workers under Kim Jong-un ’s name .
The rumor mill about Kim Jong-un ’s fate had been fueled(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) by the fact that North Korea had not reported(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) a public appearance by Kim Jong-un for weeks .
Nor had North Korea responded(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) to lurid claims about his health .
On Friday , his only sister , Kim Yo - jong , told(#included Friday) reporters that his only sister , Kim Yo - jong was “ 99 percent sure ” that Kim Jong-un had died(#included last weekend) last weekend .
died is not the first time Kim Jong-un had disappeared(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) from public view for weeks at a time or faced(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) intense speculation about his health .
And the information vacuum surrounding(#overlap 2020-05-01 23:00:17) the doings of North Korean leaders leaves(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) fertile ground for misinformation(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) to spread(#after 2020-05-01 23:00:17) .
Some past rumors about the health of North Korean leaders have indeed proved(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) true , like speculation(#included 2008) that Kim Jong-un , had(#included 2008) a stroke in 2008 .
But most turned(#included Friday) out to be groundless .
In 1986 , a South Korean newspaper reported(#included 1986) a “ world scoop(#included 1986) ” claiming(#included 1986) that Kim Jong-un ’s grandfather , then - President Kim Il - sung , had died(#included 1986) in an armed attack(#included 1986) .
A smiling(#included Friday) Kim Il - sung resurfaced(#included two days later) two days later .
In 2014 , Kim Jong-un disappeared(#included 2014) for more than a month , prompting(#included 1986) rumors that Kim Jong-un might have been deposed(#included 2014) in a coup(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) .
North Korean media later showed(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) Kim Jong-un walking(#included Friday) with a cane ; South Korean intelligence said(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) Kim Jong-un had undergone(#before 2020-05-01 23:00:17) ankle surgery .
