By Tanisha Heiberg JOHANNESBURG , March 17 ( Reuters ) - South Africa ’s Sasol said(#included Tuesday) South Africa would consider(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) a rights issue of up to $ 2 billion as South Africa works(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) to ensure(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) South Africa can pay(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) South Africa debt after an oil price slide and fears over the coronavirus outbreak sent South Africa shares to a 21 - year low .
The world ’s top manufacturer of motor fuel from coal , which is battling(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) high debt , the impact(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) of the coronavirus outbreak and falls(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) in oil and chemical prices , said(#included Tuesday) on Tuesday South Africa aimed(#included Tuesday) to generate(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) $ 6 billion as South Africa seeks(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) to stabilise(#before May 2021) its balance sheet .
2-Sasol said(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) was also in talks(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) with its lenders to make(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) sure 2-Sasol has(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) “ adequate flexibility ” on 2-Sasol debt covenants .
2-Sasol said(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol had(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) liquidity of around $ 2.5 billion with no significant debt maturities before May 2021 and believed(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol could withstand(#before May 2021) recent market volatility in the short term .
2-Sasol shares hit(#included last week) a 21 - year low last week after the fall(#included last week) in oil prices , raising(#included last week) concerns about 2-Sasol debt levels and forcing(#included last week) 2-Sasol to implement(#included last week) a plan to strengthen its balance sheet .
On Tuesday , 2-Sasol said(#included Tuesday) 2-Sasol had already entered(#included Tuesday) into a stand - by underwriting agreement(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) with BofA Securities , Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Securities for a plan to strengthen its balance sheet to selling(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) up to $ 2 billion additional shares to strengthen(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) its balance sheet .
$2 bln rights issue is expected(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) to be executed(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) after $2 bln rights issue 2020 results , depending(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) on the progress(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol makes(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) in improving(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) its balance sheet .
“ The immediate focus is on the actions to stabilise(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol and protect(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) its balance sheet so that the underlying value of the portfolio is not compromised(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) , and instead the potential realised(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) in the interests of all 2-Sasol ’s stakeholders , ” 2-Sasol said(#included Tuesday) in a statement .
2-Sasol said(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol would also immediately target(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) measures to deliver(#included 2014) a cash improvement(#included the end of June) of approximately $ 1 billion by the end of June , look at selling(#included the end of June) assets above 2-Sasol original target of $ 2 billion and seek(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) a potential partner at 2-Sasol U.S. Base Chemicals assets , which includes(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) its troubled Louisiana project .
Investors have been concerned(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) by the company ’s debt , largely due to delays(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) and cost overruns at 2-Sasol Lake Charles Chemicals project ( LCCP ) in Louisiana .
its troubled Louisiana project converts(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) natural gas into plastics ingredient ethylene , and the overruns are expected(#included 2014) to reach(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) as much as $ 12.8 billion , up from a 2014 forecast of $ 8.9 billion .
2-Sasol said(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol will review(#after 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol global cost competitiveness and business structure in an effort to ensure(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) profitability in a sustained low oil price environment
But 2-Sasol was confident 2-Sasol could comply(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) with covenant thresholds in 2-Sasol debt agreements at June , 30 2020 assuming(#included June , 30 2020) a prevailing(#included June , 30 2020) oil price of around 580 rand ( $ 35 ) per barrel .
“ I remain(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) concerned(#overlap 2020-03-17 13:16:33) about the timing of initiatives particularly since 2-Sasol did not disclose(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) whether 2-Sasol was able to extend(#included 2014) covenant headroom from its lenders for 2-Sasol December 2020 reporting(#included December 2020) period .
Without extend , 2-Sasol may not have(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) sufficient time to realise(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) optimal value within 2-Sasol asset disposal program and would then be cornered(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) into a rights issue , ” said(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) Avior ’s diversified(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) resources analyst Wade Napier .
Shares in 2-Sasol rose(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 15 % after the announcement(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) , but then reversed(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) rose and were down 17.64 % at 37.33 rand by 1137 GMT .
2-Sasol said(#before 2020-03-17 13:16:33) 2-Sasol will hold(#included the end of June) a conference call(#included Tuesday) on the measures(#included the end of June) to improve(#included December 2020) 2-Sasol balance sheet at 1300 GMT on Tuesday .
