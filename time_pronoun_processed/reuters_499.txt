WASHINGTON / BRUSSELS / LONDON ( Reuters ) - China sought(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to block(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak , according to four sources and diplomatic correspondence(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) reviewed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) by Reuters .

a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak was eventually released(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) , albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism(#included April 24 , 2020) of China rearranged(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) or removed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) , a sign of the balancing act WASHINGTON / BRUSSELS / LONDON ( Reuters ) - China is trying(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to pull(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles(#overlap 2020-04-25 01:56:00) international relations .
The Chinese Mission to EU was not immediately available(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) for comment(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) and China ’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to faxed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) questions about the exchange(#included April 24 , 2020) .
An EU spokeswoman said(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) “ EU never comment(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) on content or alleged content of internal diplomatic contacts and communication(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) with EU partners from another countries . ”
Another EU official Reuters said(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) that a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak had been published(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) as usual and denied(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) any of a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak had been watered(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) down .
Four diplomatic sources told(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) Reuters that a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak had initially been slated(#included April 21) for release(#included April 21) on April 21 but was delayed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) after Chinese officials picked(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) up on a Politico news report hat previewed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak findings(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) .
A senior Chinese official contacted(#included the same day) European officials in Beijing , China the same day to tell(#included April 21) European officials that , “ if a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak is as described(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) and a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak is released(#included today) today a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak will be very bad for cooperation(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) , ” according to EU diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters .
EU diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters quoted(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) senior Chinese foreign ministry official Yang Xiaoguang as saying(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) that publishing(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak would make(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) Beijing , China “ very angry ” and accused(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) European officials of trying(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to please(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) “ someone else ” - something the EU diplomats understood(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to be a reference to Washington .
Four diplomatic sources said(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak had been delayed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) as a result , and a comparison(#included April 24 , 2020) of the internal version of a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak and the final version published(#included late Friday) late Friday showed(#included late Friday) several differences .
For example , on the first page of a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak , the EU ’s foreign policy arm said(#included April 20) : “ China has continued(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to run(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) a global disinformation(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) campaign to deflect(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) blame for the coronavirus outbreak and improve(#after 2020-04-25 01:56:00) China international image .
Both overt and covert tactics have been observed(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) . ”
The public summary posted(#included Friday) Friday to the bloc ’s disinformation portal , euvsdisinfo.eu http://www.euvsdisinfo.eu , attributed(#included Friday) the disinformation(#included Friday) to “ state - backed sources from various governments , including(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) Russia and – to a lesser extent – China . ”
The public summary did note(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) “ significant evidence of covert Chinese operations(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) on social media , ” but the reference was left(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) to the final six paragraphs of a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak .
Disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak is emerging(#overlap 2020-04-25 01:56:00) as a flashpoint between the United States and China , and officials on the United States and China have traded(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) allegations of hiding(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) information about the coronavirus outbreak .
The disputes have sometimes caught(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) Europeans in the middle .
With more than a billion euros a day in bilateral trade(#after 2020-04-25 01:56:00) , EU is China ’s top trading(#before 2020-04-25 01:56:00) partner , while China is second only to the United States as a market for EU goods and services .
In a webcast Friday with the Friends of Europe think tank , China ’s ambassador to EU Zhang Ming said(#included Friday) , “ Disinformation is an enemy for all of us and Disinformation should be addressed(#after 2020-04-25 01:56:00) by all of us . ”
