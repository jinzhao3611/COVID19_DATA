The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday unveiled(#included Friday) a raft of measures(#included Friday) that agency chief Andrew Wheeler said(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) are designed(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) to help(#included Friday) oil refineries cope(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:50:03) with fallout from the coronavirus , including(#included Friday) waiving(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) anti - smog requirements for gasoline and extending(#included Friday) the deadline for small facilities to show(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) compliance(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) with the nation ’s biofuel law .

The outbreak(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) has touched(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) off a massive global decline(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) in demand for motor fuels and forced(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) companies to reduce(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) staffing levels to slow(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) infection rates .
Typically U.S. fuel dealers are required(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) to stop(#included May 1) selling(#included May 1) winter - grade gasoline on May 1 as summertime anti - smog standards come(#included May 1) into play .
But marketers will now be allowed(#included PRESENT_REF) to sell(#before May 20) winter - grade gasoline until at least May 20 , and possibly beyond .
“ The reason we have to do sell is because people are driving(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:50:03) fewer miles and the winter blends(#included summer) are stockpiled(#included summer) in all the tanks , ” agency chief Andrew Wheeler told(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) Reuters .
“ There ’s no place to put(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) the summer blend(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:50:03) . ”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , agency chief Andrew Wheeler said(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) , will also extend(#after 2020-03-27 18:50:03) the deadline for small oil refineries to prove(#after 2020-03-27 18:50:03) small oil refineries compliance(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) with the Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS ) , the law that requires(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) refineries to blend(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) billions of gallons of biofuels like ethanol into refineries fuel or buy(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) credits from those that do .
Refiners are typically required(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:50:03) to prove(#included March 31) Refiners compliance(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) by March 31 , but facilities with less than 75,000 barrels of daily processing capacity will be given(#after 2020-03-27 18:50:03) extensions .
agency chief Andrew Wheeler said(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) required was related(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) to ongoing litigation(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) over the agency ’s Small Refinery Exemption Program , which can free(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) some small plants of their obligations under the RFS .
A federal court ruled(#included 2020-01) in January that The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had been too free with the waivers , and while The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not challenge(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) ruled , some refineries have(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) .
agency chief Andrew Wheeler said(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) it would be unfair to force(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) small refineries to comply(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) with the RFS before that case is over .
“ We ’re extending(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) the compliance(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) assistance(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) to all the smaller refineries , ” agency chief Andrew Wheeler said(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) .
In the meantime , The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will not revisit(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) or rescind(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) any of the exemptions The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has given(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) to small refineries in the past .
“ Investigating(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) and initiating(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) enforcement(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) actions against small refineries that were previously subject to an exemption(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) is a low priority for The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , ” The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) in a press release(#before 2020-03-27 18:50:03) outlining(#included 2020-01) the moves(#included summer) .
