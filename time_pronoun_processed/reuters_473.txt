Deckchairs sit(#included March 16 , 2020) stacked(#included March 16 , 2020) outside a closed movie theater during the global outbreak(#included March 16 , 2020) of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) in Santa Monica , California , U.S. , March 16 , 2020 .
REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson NEW YORK ( Reuters Breakingviews ) - Dark movie theaters may just be a taste of the near future .
Even before Covid-19 completely shut(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) down projectors at venues offered(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) by the likes of AMC Entertainment , attendance(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) was in decline(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) and streaming(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) services like Netflix on the rise(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) .
AMC Entertainment is fighting(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) back , but the notion that America ’s cinemas will fill(#Depend-on 2020-04-29 21:35:24) up again may be as quaint(#Depend-on 2020-04-29 21:35:24) as a silent film .
With everyone stuck(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) at home , Hollywood has(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) time to figure(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) out more ways to cut(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) out the exhibitors .
Comcast ’s NBC Universal released(#included April 10) “ Trolls World Tour ” on April 10 directly to people ’s homes and made(#included April 10) several other movies already showing(#included April 10) on big screens available to rent(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) for $ 20 .
There are incentives to wiggle(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) around theaters .
In general box - office ticket sales(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) are split(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) 50 - 50 between exhibitors and studios .
With streaming(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) services like Netflix or Amazon.com or through traditional cable , studios keep(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) about 80 % of the take(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) .
The “ Trolls ” sequel broke(#included April 10) first - day and opening - weekend records for Universal ’s home - entertainment unit , racking(#included April 10) up some 10 times the previous record receipts for a digital release .
The “ Trolls ” sequel has now brought(#included now) in nearly $ 100 million in rentals , the Wall Street Journal reported(#included this week) this week .
In terms of revenue for Comcast , that makes(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) The “ Trolls ” sequel more lucrative than the original ’s $ 154 million in gross domestic U.S. box - office receipts to date .
Netflix has changed(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) the game too .
Netflix mostly bypasses(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) theaters for Netflix original movies , instead choosing(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) to use(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) releases like “ Roma ” as a way to hook(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) potential subscribers .
Lockdown has accelerated(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) Netflix ’s subscriber growth(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) .
Many of the largest studios ’ parent companies , notably Walt Disney , Comcast and ATT , now have(#included now) streaming services .
Walt Disney pushed(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) Walt Disney upcoming(#included opening) flick “ Artemis Fowl ” to Walt Disney online Disney+ platform for a June release(#included June) rather than wait until theaters reopen(#included June) .
The number of Americans trekking(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) to box offices is in long - term decline(#included 2002) from a peak in 2002 with 1.6 billion tickets sold(#included 2002) .
From lockdown(#included now) AMC Entertainment , is resisting(#overlap 2020-04-29 21:35:24) :
On Tuesday AMC Entertainment said(#included Tuesday) AMC Entertainment would boycott(#included the next day) Universal ’s films in light of the studio parent ’s comments(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) about digital releases(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) .
AMC ’s stock jumped(#included the next day) more than 20 % the next day , but AMC ’s market value is still only about a quarter of the $ 2 billion AMC ’s was worth shortly after going(#included 2013) public in 2013 .
The fresh damage(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) from the pandemic may never be reversed(#before 2020-04-29 21:35:24) .
