It is too soon to decide(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) whether Tour de France can go(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) ahead amid the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) , but if Tour de France does Tour de France may be without roadside spectators in order to minimise(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) infection risk , the French sports minister said(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) .

Following(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) the postponement(#included June) of the Euro 2020 soccer Championship and the Tokyo Olympic Games , Tour de France - is one of the last major global sporting(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) events that has not yet been cancelled(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) or postponed(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) .
“ Tour de France is a sports monument .
It is too soon to decide(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) .
There is a time for everything .
For now , we have(#included PRESENT_REF) a more urgent battle(#included June) to fight(#after 2020-03-26 13:45:40) .
Let(#included June) we focus(#included June) on this mountain in front of we and then consider(#included June) what ’s next , ” French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu wrote(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) on Twitter .
Since the Tour ’s inception(#included 1903) in 1903 , only the two world wars of 1914 - 1918 and 1939 - 1945 have forced(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) organisers to cancel(#after 1914) the race .
A Sports ministry spokeswoman told(#included Thursday) Reuters on Thursday that Sports ministry was monitoring(#included Thursday) the pandemic ’s evolution .
“ There is no rush to decide(#included June) today , ” A Sports ministry spokeswoman said(#included Thursday) , 92 days ahead of the Tour de France ’s scheduled(#included June) June 27 start in the Mediterranean city of Nice .
the pandemic ’s evolution is due to finish(#included June) in Paris on July 19 .
In an interview(#included Thursday) with radio station France Bleu late on Wednesday , French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu said(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) that one option would be to organise(#after 2020-03-26 13:45:40) a Tour without roadside spectators .
“ The Tour(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) ’s economic model is not based(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) on ticket sales(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) but on TV rights .
During this period of confinement(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) , everybody is aware of the risks and responsible , ” the French sports minister said(#included today) .
“ People understand(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) the benefits of staying(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) home and watching(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) event on TV rather than live .
It would not be too detrimental to follow(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) Tour de France on TV . ”
Tour de France attracts(#after 1914) more than 10 million spectators along France ’s roads every year and is broadcast(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) globally .
However , Marc Madiot , the president of the French cycling league and director of the Groupama – FDJ cycling team said(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) it would be difficult to police(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) a Tour without spectators .
“ How would you stop(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) the public from attending(#included 2020-04-01) ? ”
Marc Madiot , the president of the French cycling league and director of the Groupama – FDJ cycling team said(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) .
France ’s 67 million people have broadly respected(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) the conditions of an unprecedented peacetime lockdown(#included last week) but few sports stir(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) the passions of French sports enthusiasts more than cycling .
Moreover , riders often race(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) large parts of a stage in closely - packed groups and team members live(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) in close proximity to one another for nearly a month in hotels , and travel(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) together on buses and airplanes that shuttle(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) closely - packed groups and team members between stages .
Teams are already grappling(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) with how to keep(#overlap 2020-03-26 13:45:40) Teams riders fit after the cycling season was suspended(#included last week) last week .
All races(#before the end of April) up until the end of April have been cancelled(#before the end of April) .
“ As long as we are not allowed(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) to get(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) out on the road , it is hard to think(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) about getting(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) in shape for the event , ” AG2R - La Mondiale rider Romain Bardet told(#before 2020-03-26 13:45:40) radio station France Bleu .
