Analysis | SoftBank’s Nuclear Option Puts(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the ‘You’ Back In to WeWork .
2020-03-18 05:18:37 +00:00 .
SoftBank is unlikely to give(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) up on WeWork , because WeWork ca n’t .
Which puts(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the ball in Neumann ’s court .
The $ 3 billion deal that SoftBank says(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank could walk(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) away from , because of the regulatory investigations , is just one part of a package totaling(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) close to $ 8 billion put(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) together to bail(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) out WeWork after WeWork offering(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) plans were scrapped(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) and value massively written(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) down .
Among the items in SoftBank Oct. 23 funding(#included Oct. 23) announcement(#included Oct. 23) is the acceleration(#included Oct. 23) of an existing(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) $ 1.5 billion commitment and over $ 5 billion in debt financing.(1(#Depend-on 2020-03-18 05:18:37) )
The tender offer for shares was a big deal(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) because that ’s what helped(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank boost(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank stake from 29 % to 80 % .
The tender offer for shares also allowed(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son to install(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son own executive team at WeWork — Chairman Marcelo Claure is SoftBank chief operating officer — and start(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) calling(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the shots on everything from employee layoffs(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) to unwinding(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) earlier acquisitions(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) .
If the purchase(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) of those existing(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) shares does n’t go(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) through , then Neumann gets(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) to hold(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) on to Neumann stake in a company worth pennies to the dollar of where it was a year ago .
SoftBank may not even have(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) control , limiting(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank ability to steer(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) WeWork to profitability .
But SoftBank has to do something .
Last week SoftBank announced(#included Last week) plans to buy(#included the past month) back $ 4.8 billion shares , an opportunistic move(#included Last week) aimed(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) at propping(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) up the stock and alleviating(#included Last week) some of the pressure(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) put(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) on by activist investor Elliott Management Corp.
announced spurred(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SP Global Ratings to put(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank on negative outlook , the first step before actually cutting(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank credit rating .
SoftBank stock dropped(#included the past month) as much as 12 % , taking(#included the past month) the decline(#included the past month) over the past month to more than 40 % .
At the same time , the global economic meltdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has made(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the Vision Fund ’s portfolio of unprofitable startups look(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) shaky .
unprofitable startups survive(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) on continuous streams of cash until unprofitable startups can eventually turn(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) a profit , and that lifeline may get(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) cut(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) in a credit crunch .
Walking(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) away from The tender offer for shares is entirely possible(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) .
This would be the nuclear option in the sense that doing so amounts(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) to mutually assured destruction(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) .
Without purchasing(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) $ 4.8 billion shares , SoftBank would be left(#after 2020-03-18 05:18:37) sharing(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) control with the same executive team and investors who oversaw(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) WeWork early blunders(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) — making(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) it tough to effect(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the wholesale changes needed(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) for a turnaround .
Yet SoftBank has already plowed(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) so much cash into WeWork that WeWork final demise(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) would cause(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) further pain not just to investors , but WeWork own reputation as a savvy and trustworthy investor .
Neumann could hold(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) Neumann ground and insist(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) on the originally agreed(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) price .
But the regulatory investigations seem(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) targeted(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) at Neumann , and actions that took(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) place under Neumann watch , including(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) concerns over self - dealings , disclosures and conflicts of interest(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) .
That gives(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) SoftBank the opportunity to point(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the finger not only at Neumann but at existing(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) shareholders who share(#overlap 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the responsibility of not exercising(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) enough oversight(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) .
That means that if The tender offer for shares does fail(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) , SoftBank can put(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) the blame(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) on the counterparty with a reminder that there wo n’t be a better offer elsewhere .
In the global economic meltdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic , SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son is in a position to show(#before 2020-03-18 05:18:37) what it would look like if “ We ” are not in this together .
