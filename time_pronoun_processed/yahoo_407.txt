As many as 1,000 of 635 people were medical workers .
( For the latest case total and death(#included Friday morning) toll , see Business Insider 's live updates(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) here . )
Some workers who contracted(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL OF WUHAN VIA WEIBO /via have died(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) .
More still are working(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) in dire conditions , without the protection or resources More need(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) to control(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) an epidemic(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) .
Here is the situation on the ground : Doctors in Wuhan , which was placed under a sweeping quarantine on January 24 , have been faced(#included Friday morning) with far more patients than Doctors in Wuhan , which was placed under a sweeping quarantine on January 24 can handle(#after 2020-02-07 18:19:23) .
About when a sweeping quarantine began(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) , one doctor told(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) BBC News : " The hospitals have been flooding(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) with patients , there are thousands , one doctor have n't seen(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) so many before .
" one doctor am scared(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) because THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL OF WUHAN VIA WEIBO /via is a new virus and the figures are alarming . "
Early in the outbreak(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) , scientists had not yet realized(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) that THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL OF WUHAN VIA WEIBO /via could spread(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) from human to human .
During that time , many doctors did n't wear(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) protective gear .
China has(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) relatively few doctors per capita compared(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) with countries like the US , and those China does have(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) are less well - trained .
According to Business Insider 's Aria Bendix , China has(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) less than two physicians for every 10,000 residents .
Only about 60 % have(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) undergraduate degrees , and only about 10 % have(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) graduate degrees , a radical difference from in European and North American health systems .
Wuhan medical staff were soon overwhelmed(#included January 24) .
In response(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) at least 6,000 medics from other parts of China were sent(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) in , despite the risks .

On January 29 , Business Insider 's Will Martin reported(#included January 29) that China had had deployed(#included January 29) 4,130 medics from other parts of China to Hubei province , which contains(#overlap 2020-02-07 18:19:23) Wuhan .
China was planning(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) to increase(#after 2020-02-07 18:19:23) the figure to 6,000 , according to China National Health Commission .
Even with enough doctors , many hospitals were desperately short of supplies .
This included(#included January 29) protective gear for the medics .
"
Many were not initially informed(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) about the potential for people - to - person transmission , and even now China do n't have(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) enough protective gear , test kits , and other supplies , " one Wuhan doctor told(#included January 24) the South China Morning Post on January 24 .
There were also too few testing(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) kits for patients , making(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) it hard to distinguish(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) a coronavirus case from any other flu or cold .
Patients in Wuhan came(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) to consider(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) getting(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) access to a testing kit as being like winning(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) the lottery .
Some hospitals have been pleading(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) for donations(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) of supplies from ordinary people .
A social - media post from the Wuhan Children 's Hospital , cited(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) by BBC News , said(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) simply : " Medical supplies are in short supply - help ! "
Some staff complained(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) on social media that hospitals were even running(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) out of food and drink .
Wuhan hospitals also lacked(#before 2020-02-07 18:19:23) beds .
On January 29 , China announced(#included January 23) China would build(#included February 3) two new hospitals to cope(#after 2020-02-07 18:19:23) .
One opened(#included February 3) February 3 , the second on February 6 .
