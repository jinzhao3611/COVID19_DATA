France ’s president Emmanuel Macron has announced(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) that France will remain(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) in strict lockdown for another month .
In a national address on Monday evening , France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#included Monday evening) that only by respecting(#included Monday evening) the confinement rules would the battle(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) against Covid-19 be won(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) France would start(#included 11 May) returning(#included 11 May) to normal life on 11 May , if citizens were “ civic , responsible and respected(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) the confinement rules ” – and if the number of virus cases continued(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) to drop(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
“ France have to continue(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) France efforts ; the more the confinement rules are respected(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) the more lives will be saved(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
That is why I am announcing(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) strict lockdown will continue(#before 2020-04-13) until Monday 11 May. ”

It was France ’s president Emmanuel Macron ’s fourth televised(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) address(#included Monday evening) since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) and expectations were high , not just that France ’s president Emmanuel Macron would make(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) concrete announcements but that France ’s president Emmanuel Macron would give(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) some direction and reassurance(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
Hospital admissions and death rates appear(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) to have levelled(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) off – though as Jérôme Salomon , the head of the French health authority , has repeated(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) , Hospital admissions and death rates remain(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) at a “ high level ” – and the French were keen to know(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) if and when the four - week lockdown(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) restrictions(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) might be eased(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
In a 30 - minute speech(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) marked(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) by a tone of humility , France ’s president Emmanuel Macron gave(#included Monday evening) an explanation , a response(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) and a calendar for the next few weeks .
France ’s president Emmanuel Macron admitted(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) several times that there had been failings in dealing(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) with strict lockdown , particularly with the lack of masks and equipment , but promised(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) that by 11 May there would be enough tests(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) for “ the elderly , health workers and the most vulnerable ” and masks for everyone .
“ Were we prepared(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) ?
No .
Clearly not enough .
There were failings(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) , there was a lack of material , ” France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
France ’s president Emmanuel Macron added(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) that the next few weeks would be used(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) to obtain(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) more tests(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) , masks and equipment , and organise(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) financial aid not only for businesses but for those families in a precarious situation .
“ These are difficult days and France are now feeling(#included now) afraid and anxious for our parents and France , ” France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
From 11 May , creches , schools , colleges and lycées will be “ progressively opened(#included 11 May) ” as a priority , France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
“ Many children are missing(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) out of school and there is an inequality in that there are those who do n’t have access to the internet and ca n’t be helped(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) by our parents . ”
While schools will open(#included 11 May) from 11 May , France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) restaurants , cafes , hotels , museums and cultural sites must stay(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) closed(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) and large festivals and events may only be allowed(#before mid - July) after mid - July .
France ’s president Emmanuel Macron made(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) reference to European Union solidarity and the need to support(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) African countries , including(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) the possibility of cancelling(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) African countries debt .
France ’s president Emmanuel Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) that France ’s borders with non - EU countries would remain(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) closed(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
This is not thought(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) to include(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) the UK , as Britain is still in the Brexit transition(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) period .
France ’s president Emmanuel Macron concluded(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) : “ Britain have to reinvent(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) Britain , and France ’s president Emmanuel Macron first of all , ” France ’s president Emmanuel Macron added(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) .
“ Britain are vulnerable .
When can Britain hope(#Depend-on 2020-04-13 19:31:56) for an end(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) to reinvent ?
I understand(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) you have(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) many questions
and I would like to answer(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) many questions .
But I say(#included today) in all humility , Britain do n’t have(#included today) definitive answers today .
“ Britain will share(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) with you what Britain know(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) and what Britain do n’t know(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) , Britain will come(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) out of this , but Britain still have(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) several months of living with strict lockdown .
“ Britain will have(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) better days , we will find(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) again happy days .
And the virtues that will allow(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) Britain to get(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) through reinvent are the same that will help(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) Britain build(#after 2020-04-13 19:31:56) Britain future : solidarity , confidence , willingness .
Take(#overlap 2020-04-13 19:31:56) care of you and each other and Britain will get(#before 2020-04-13 19:31:56) through this . ”
