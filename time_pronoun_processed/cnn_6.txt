attorney Lance Lazzaro comments(#before 2020-04-02 17:42:28) came(#before 2020-04-02 17:42:28) after New York District Judge Paul Engelmayer said(#before 2020-04-02 17:42:28) in a court filing New York District Judge Paul Engelmayer would have sentenced(#before 2020-04-02 17:42:28) Tekashi 6ix9ine , whose name is Daniel Hernandez , to home confinement if New York District Judge Paul Engelmayer had known(#before 2020-04-02 17:42:28) about the coronavirus .

attorney Lance Lazzaro reiterated(#included March 31) in another letter on July 31 that Daniel Hernandez has(#included Thursday) " severe asthma and was recently hospitalized(#included recently) for bronchitis , " making(#included recently) Daniel Hernandez vulnerable to the coronavirus .
