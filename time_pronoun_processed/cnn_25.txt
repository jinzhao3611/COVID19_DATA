MARIETTA , Ga. ( CBS46 ) --
Several small businesses are being forced(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) to close(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) Several small businesses doors due to the coronavirus .
But local cycling studio co - owners got(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) a little creative to keep(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) local cycling studio co - owners business afloat – and give(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) local cycling studio co - owners customers an outlet while local cycling studio co - owners 're stuck(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) at home .
“ We said(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) , you know(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) what , we ’ve got(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) 48 bikes sitting(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) in our studio , collecting(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) dust , and there are people out there who need(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) it , ” Kirsten Rickers said(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) .
Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , allowed(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) customers to take(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) stationary bikes home during the downtime caused(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) by the temporary closure .
“ In like two days , Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , rented(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) a truck and delivered(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) stationary bikes , ” added(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , .
Instead of coming(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) into our studio , we ’ve offering(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) online classes -- knowing(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) many people are stuck(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) indoors due to the coronavirus .
“ It ’s not just the physical activity that keeps(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , connected(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) , It ’s great therapy(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) , and I think(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) in times like this , Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , need(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) It , ” Kirsten Rickers said(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) .
we ’ve charge(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) a small rental fee per month , which will help(#after 2020-03-26 00:26:33) pay(#after 2020-03-26 00:26:33) operating expenses the business needs(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) to pay(#after 2020-03-26 00:26:33) in the interim .

“ This is way for Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , to get(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) stationary bikes to a lot of our riders , and if a lot of our riders keep(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) a lot of our riders membership with Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , , a lot of our riders can have(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) access to Kirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , livestream classes , ” said(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) Lee Oesterling , the co - owners of Cyclebar East Cobb , .
The response(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) from the community was overwhelming , stationary bikes were reserved(#before 2020-03-26 00:26:33) within hours , and people are offering(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) to also buy(#after 2020-03-26 00:26:33) gift cards for future rides(#after 2020-03-26 00:26:33) to ensure(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) the business stays(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:26:33) afloat .
