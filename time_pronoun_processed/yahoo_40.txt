Here's 'the problem' with the IRS coronavirus tax filing extension, one expert says(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) .
2020-04-03 02:10:47 +00:00 .
As the coronavirus escalates(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) across the United States , businesses and individuals are concerned(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) with how this will affect(#after 2020-04-03 02:10:47) businesses and individuals taxes , despite the deadline being extended to July 15 .
the deadline being extended to July 15 is not a blanket extension for all taxes , tax litigation consultant and author of “ Small Business Tax Guide ” Daniel Pilla told(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) Yahoo Finance ’s
On the Move on Thursday .
the deadline being extended to July 15 only applies(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) to income taxes and not employment taxes businesses have to pay(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) , tax litigation consultant and author of “ Small Business Tax Guide ” Daniel Pilla pointed(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) out .
“ The problem with this ... is the extension that IRS granted(#included 2020-W13) last week , from April 15 to July 15 , applies(#included 2020-04-15) to income taxes only .
Alright ?
This is very important for people to understand(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) , that we ’re only talking(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) about an income tax filing and an income tax extension .
an income tax filing and an income tax extension does not apply(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) to employment taxes , ” tax litigation consultant and author of “ Small Business Tax Guide ” Daniel Pilla said(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) .
That means that small businesses still have to file(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) small businesses 941 forms , which employers use(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) to report(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) taxes withheld(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) from workers ’ paychecks and to pay(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) employers portion of Social Security or Medicare .
Employers still have to file(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) employment tax returns on time and make(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) employment tax deposits on time , according to Pilla .
Of course , Pilla added(#included 2020-04-02) , have raises(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) the question of what happens(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) when employers ca n’t make(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) those filings on time .
Asked(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) if IRS was likely to go(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) after small businesses for not paying(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) taxes , Pilla said(#included 2020-04-02) , “ Pilla just received(#included 2020-04-15) a news bulletin from the Internal Revenue Service from yesterday afternoon , a news bulletin from the Internal Revenue Service from yesterday afternoon ’s not even on the Internal Revenue Service website yet , that says(#included PRESENT_REF) we ’re going(#included 2020-07-15) to back(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) off on enforcement(#included 2020-07-15) between now and July 15 . ”
Moreover , Pilla said(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) , if individuals and businesses ca n’t file(#included 2020-04-15) individuals and businesses income taxes by July 15 , individuals and businesses also have(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) the option to file(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) for yet another six - month extension .
“ That ’s automatic .
You do n’t need(#overlap 2020-04-03 02:10:47) a reason for file , ” Pilla said(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) .
Still , IRS encouraged(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) all taxpayers who believe(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) we ’re owed a refund(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) to file(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) as soon as possible — even though the deadline being extended to July 15 has been extended(#before 2020-04-03 02:10:47) .
