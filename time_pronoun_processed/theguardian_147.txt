a draft document comes(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) as Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in containing(#overlap 2020-05-06 06:47:28) the virus ’ spread , with 164,807 cases and 6,996 deaths(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) .
Though it is unclear from a draft document when Germany ’s top flight football league , the Bundesliga , will restart(#included May 15) , some states want(#Depend-on 2020-05-06 06:47:28) Germany ’s top flight football league , the Bundesliga to kick(#included May 15) off again on May 15 .
Two people familiar(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) with the preparations(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) have told(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) Reuters Germany ’s top flight football league , the Bundesliga is probably set(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) to be given(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) the green light to restart(#after 2020-05-06 06:47:28) then .
a draft document says(#included May 5) the start of matches must be preceded(#Depend-on 2020-05-06 06:47:28) by two weeks of quarantine(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) , possibly as a training camp .
In a bid(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) to prevent(#after 2020-05-06 06:47:28) a second widespread coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) , the federal government and states agreed(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) in preliminary talks(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) that if the number of new infections rises(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) after restrictions(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) on public life are eased(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) , local restrictions(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) should be reintroduced(#after 2020-05-06 06:47:28) immediately .
The plan is for this threshold to be set(#after 2020-05-06 06:47:28) at “ more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the last seven days ” in districts .
If there is a limited outbreak(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) , such as in a nursing home , restrictions(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) might only be applied(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) there , The paper seen by Reuters showed(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) .
“ If there is a dispersed regional outbreak(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) and infection chains are unclear , general restrictions(#before 20 April) , such as those in force in Germany before 20 April , must be consistently reintroduced(#before 20 April) regionally , ” The paper seen by Reuters says(#overlap 2020-05-06 06:47:28) .
reintroduced would include(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) restricting(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) travel to and from these regions , The paper seen by Reuters added(#before 2020-05-06 06:47:28) .
