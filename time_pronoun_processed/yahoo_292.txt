In coronavirus crisis,(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) Trump's stock-market advice keeps(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) looking(#overlap 2020-03-09 21:48:58) worse .
2020-03-09 21:48:58 +00:00 .
Almost forgotten(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) in the rush of doom - and - gloom headlines about the spread of coronavirus and Monday ’s record - breaking stock market sell - off is President Trump ’s two - week - old advice to would - be investors to buy(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) stocks .
Though the first market jitters over the economic impact(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) of coronavirus had already led(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) to consecutive triple digit losses(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) , President Trump posted(#included Feb. 24) an optimistic appraisal of the investment landscape on Feb. 24 .
Hours after Monday ’s tweet(#included Feb. 24) was published(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) , the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed(#included Feb. 24) at 28,992 , down 227 points .
A day later Larry Kudlow , Trump ’s director of the National Economic Council , made(#included Feb. 24) a second appeal on behalf of the beleaguered stock market .
“ The virus story is not going(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) to last(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) forever , ” Larry Kudlow , Trump ’s director of the National Economic Council , said(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) in an interview(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) .
“ Larry Kudlow , Trump ’s director of the National Economic Council , would suggest very seriously taking(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) a look at the beleaguered stock market , that is a lot cheaper than that was a week or two ago . ”
Despite Larry Kudlow , Trump ’s director of the National Economic Council , ’s optimism , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell(#included that week) another 1,031 points that day , to close(#included that week) at 27,912 .
In fact , that day turned(#included that week) out to be the worst for the beleaguered stock market since the 2007 financial crisis(#included 2007) , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing(#included that week) 3,500 points and wiping(#included that week) out $ 3 trillion in value .
On Feb. 27 , three days after offering(#included Feb. 27) his stock market tip , President Trump announced(#included Feb. 27) President Trump was appointing(#included that week) Vice President Mike Pence to head(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) up President Trump coronavirus task force , which also included(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) Larry Kudlow , Trump ’s director of the National Economic Council , .
During a White House press conference(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) , President Trump assured(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) assured(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) the country that the number of Americans infected(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) with the virus “ was going(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) very substantially down , not up , ” and that “ within a couple of days ” the tally would be “ down close to zero . ”
Perhaps buoyed(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) by that infectious confidence , President Trump ’s son , Eric , jumped(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) on the “ buy(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) the dip ” bandwagon .
But just as the number of cases did not go(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) down as President Trump had foreseen(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) ( the number of cases has risen(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) from 60 confirmed(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) cases at the time of Monday ’s press conference(#included Monday) to over 600 as of Monday ) , the beleaguered stock market proved(#included Monday) an equally bad bet .
On Monday , the beleaguered stock market fell(#included Feb. 27) 2,014 points , the larges single - day point loss(#included Feb. 27) in history , and closed(#included Feb. 27) at 23,851 .
For those keeping(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) score at home , that more than 5,000 points lower than when President Trump proclaimed(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) the markets were starting(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) to look(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) good .
Of course , President Trump is n’t the first president to encourage(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) Americans to invest(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) in the beleaguered stock market .
On March 3 , 2009 , President Trump saw(#included that week) an opportunity to buy(#included that week) following(#included 2007) a nearly 300 - point dip in the Dow , which at that time had fallen to 6,726 points in the wake of the great recession .
“ What you ’re now seeing(#included Monday) is profit - and - earnings rations are starting(#overlap 2020-03-09 21:48:58) to get(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) to the point where buying(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) stocks is a potentially good deal if you ’re got(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) a long - term perspective on a nearly 300 - point dip in the Dow , which at that time had fallen to 6,726 points in the wake of the great recession . ”
From the time President Trump said(#included Monday) that through the end of President Trump presidency , the SP 500 rose(#before 2020-03-09 21:48:58) by nearly 225 percent .
