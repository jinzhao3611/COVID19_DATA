Self-employed will struggle(#after 2020-03-29 17:53:35) during this pandemic(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) | Letters .
2020-03-29 17:53:35 +00:00 .
As a freelancer of nearly 20 years ’ standing , I welcome(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) the support package for self - employed people ( Coronavirus : UK offers(#included 5 April) self - employed 80 % of earnings , 26 March ) .
But the exclusion(#included 2019) of those who have become(#included 2019) self - employed since the end of the 2018 - 19 tax year is disappointing(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
It can hardly have escaped(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) the chancellor ’s attention that the 2018 - 19 tax year ends(#included 5 April) on 5 April – nearly two months before the scheme is expected(#after 2020-03-29 17:53:35) to begin(#after 2020-03-29 17:53:35) paying(#included 5 April) out .
So why ca n’t the recently self - employed be assessed(#included recently) pro rata on the basis of a promptly submitted(#included 2019) 2019 - 20 tax return(#included 2019) ?
Likewise , I hope(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) that assessment of those who became self - employed in 2018 - 19 will take(#after 2020-03-29 17:53:35) account of the date on which those who became self - employed in 2018 - 19 self - employment commenced(#included the) , rather than assuming(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) those who became self - employed in 2018 - 19 earnings for the 2018 - 19 tax year represent(#included 2019) a whole year ’s income .

It seems(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) the chancellor ’s support for those suffering(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic only goes(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) so far .
Those recently entering(#included recently) self - employment can apparently go(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) swing(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
I started(#included the) self - employment in 2019 - 20 after 44 years of paid(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) ( and taxed(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) ) employment .
As a result I am one of very few people who will not benefit(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) from any grant or help that the government is offering(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
At the same time I started(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) self - employment , my wife decided(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) to give(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) up my wife reasonably paid position to work(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) in a care home on minimum wage .
We were confident I income would support(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) We until retirement(#after 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
my wife ’s low income also means(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) no universal credit either .
I have lost(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) all I work and income , and the chancellor does n’t care(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) because there would be a risk of fraud , and yet I will shortly submit(#included 2018) I tax return for the year ending(#included 2019) 5 April 2020 and subsequently pay(#after 2020-03-29 17:53:35) tax .

In 1996 , I wrote(#included 1996) a pamphlet for the Institute of Employment Rights .
a pamphlet for the Institute of Employment Rights was called(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) Towards the Insecurity Society .
a pamphlet for the Institute of Employment Rights showed(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) how a scourge of self - employment had exploded(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) in the construction industry in the UK .
Relieving(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) employers of payment of national insurance , and with lower rates of tax and insurance for the self - employed , a powerful fiscal drive pushed(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) millions of building workers into false self - employment .
Workers were given(#included 26 March) no option but to be self - employed : no employment(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) rights , no security , no safety training , no apprenticeships , no pensions .
Most were working(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) for the same contractors , under Most instruction(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) , using(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) Most capital equipment .
It was , and is , mass bogus self - employment , infecting(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) most large building sites .
I predicted(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) that this fiscal regime would equally drive(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) bogus self - employment into other sectors of the economy .
But I could never have foreseen(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) just how widespread bogus self - employment would become(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
More recently , I calculated(#included recently) that this fiscal driver cost(#included recently) the Treasury at least £ 1.5bn a year in lost(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) national insurance and taxation , just for the construction industry , never mind other sectors .
Now this bogus self - employment epidemic has collided(#included Now) with the coronavirus pandemic .
Millions of self - employed find(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) Millions of self - employed threatened(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) with the abyss of no financial protection .
this fiscal regime created(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) a situation in which the Treasury was losing(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) billions each year .
Now the Treasury is being asked(#included Now) to bail(#included Now) out the bottomless pit of which the Treasury was the architect(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
If there could be a silver lining to this bogus self - employment epidemic , the underlying(#overlap 2020-03-29 17:53:35) epidemic(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) of bogus self - employment and the vulnerability bogus self - employment has created(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) needs(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) to be suppressed(#before 2020-03-29 17:53:35) .
Not by any vaccine , but by the justice of good law and equitable tax regimes .
