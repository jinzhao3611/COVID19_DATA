In a conference(#included Friday night) call Friday night , Rutter told(#included Friday night) orchestra leaders that the 96 musicians would receive(#included the end of May) the 96 musicians last paycheck on April 3 and that the 96 musicians will not be paid(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) until Kennedy Center reopens(#after 2020-03-28 19:00:43) .
In addition , Rutter said(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) the 96 musicians health care benefits would stop(#included the end of May) at the end of May if Kennedy Center is still closed(#included the end of May) at that time .
told was characterized(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) by several NSO members as a shock(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) .
Ed Malaga , president of Local 161 - 710 of the American Federation of Musicians , described(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) told as outrageous and said(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) the American Federation of Musicians has filed(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) a grievance challenging(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) what the American Federation of Musicians believes(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) is an illegal action .
“ told is not only outrageous — coming(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) after the 96 musicians had expressed(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) the 96 musicians willingness to discuss(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) ways to accommodate(#after 2020-03-28 19:00:43) Kennedy Center during that time — told is also blatantly illegal under the parties ’ collective bargaining agreement .
the parties ’ collective bargaining agreement specifically requires(#overlap 2020-03-28 19:00:43) that Kennedy Center provide(#overlap 2020-03-28 19:00:43) six weeks ’ notice before Kennedy Center can stop(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) paying(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) musicians for economic reasons , ” Ed Malaga , president of Local 161 - 710 of the American Federation of Musicians , said(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) in a statement(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) .
the 96 musicians contract does not include(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) what is known(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) as a force majeure clause , a typical provision in contracts that allows(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) one side to renege(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) on the parties ’ collective bargaining agreement if there is a situation beyond one side control .
Most of Kennedy Center other union contracts , with stagehands and box office workers , for example , include(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) a force majeure clause .
Many of stagehands and box office workers were laid(#included mid - March) off in mid - March .
In an interview(#included Thursday) Thursday , Rutter said(#included Thursday) the $ 25 million from the $ 2.2 trillion federal stimulus package was intended(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) to support(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) Kennedy Center mission(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) as a presidential memorial .
A two - month closure , representing(#overlap 2020-03-28 19:00:43) the most optimistic scenario , would result(#after 2020-03-28 19:00:43) in income losses(#after 2020-03-28 19:00:43) of $ 20 million , Rutter said(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) .
With no money coming(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) in , Kennedy Center needed(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) help to pay(#after 2020-03-28 19:00:43) Kennedy Center estimated(#overlap 2020-03-28 19:00:43) $ 6 million monthly costs , Rutter said(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) , “ the $ 25 million from the $ 2.2 trillion federal stimulus package ’s not a bailout , ” Rutter said(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) .
“ the $ 25 million from the $ 2.2 trillion federal stimulus package will hopefully allow(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) us to keep(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) the personnel together , to keep(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) Kennedy Center going(#overlap 2020-03-28 19:00:43) . ”

“ This is of course shocking news to the 96 symphony musicians under union contract(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) — and posted despite a $ 25 million boost earmarked(#included Thursday) specifically for Kennedy Center in today ’s passed historic stimulus bill that is designed(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) to help(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) employees maintain(#overlap 2020-03-28 19:00:43) footing during this pandemic(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) war(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) , ” Cellist Steven Honigberg , a member of the orchestra since 1984 wrote(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) .

Thanks ( NOT ) Deborah for Deborah compassion(#before 2020-03-28 19:00:43) for the musicians of your National Symphony Orchestra in that time .
