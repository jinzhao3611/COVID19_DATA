Unfashionable white eggs normally used in McDonald ’s breakfast McMuffins are making(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) a surprise(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) comeback on the shelves of Tesco – the first time Tesco has sold(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) Unfashionable white eggs normally used in McDonald ’s breakfast McMuffins for more than 40 years .
Following(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) a successful trial(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) , Tesco will sell(#after 2020-05-24 23:13:08) White shelled eggs in order to meet(#after 2020-05-24 23:13:08) unprecedented demand from shoppers , while supporting(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) suppliers and avoiding(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) waste .
Sales of fresh eggs have soared(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) in the UK since the outbreak of coronavirus – and sold(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) out during early stockpiling(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) – as consumers stocked(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) up with the high - protein , versatile food and staple breakfast and brunch ingredient .
With more people cooking and eating at home alongside a home - baking boom since the pandemic started(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) , Tesco has seen(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) demand for eggs rocket by 30 % year on year .
Jean - Paul Michalski , the director of Noble Foods , which is supplying Tesco with the eggs , said(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) : “ Generally White shelled eggs are sold(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to a very large global restaurant chain which unfortunately had to close its doors because of the pandemic .
White shelled eggs are also used(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) within egg processing where the egg is broken(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) into a liquid to be used(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) for food manufacturers , hotel or restaurants .
“ None of Noble Foods , which is supplying Tesco with the eggs standard retail customers stock white eggs
so Noble Foods , which is supplying Tesco with the eggs are really grateful(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to Tesco for stepping(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) in as White shelled eggs would have gone(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to waste(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) . ”
White shelled eggs will cost(#after 2020-05-24 23:13:08) the same as the brown free - range equivalent , starting(#included year) from 89p for a box of six medium eggs .
Until the early 1970s white eggs – which are generally medium - sized – were popular(#included the 1980s) in the UK but the early 1970s white eggs – which are generally medium - sized – had fallen(#included the 1980s) out of favour by the end of the decade when shoppers began(#included the end of the decade) switching(#included the end of the decade) to the brown variety , which were larger and seen(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) as healthier .
Since the 1980s , the UK industry has produced(#after the 1980s) almost 100 % brown shelled(#after the 1980s) eggs for high street retailers .
As a result there are now very few white egg - laying flocks in the UK ; down to an estimated(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) 250,000 - 300,000 of the 40 m egg - laying birds in the UK .
Tesco eggs buying(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) manager Megan Kilby said(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) : “ The initial trial(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) during the lockdown has been a success and Noble Foods , which is supplying Tesco with the eggs will now be stocking(#included PRESENT_REF) white free range eggs for the first time in more than 40 years .
white free range eggs are used(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) throughout the UK industry so shoppers can be assured(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) of shoppers quality .
“ stocking could also have(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) an agricultural benefit as white hens are more docile than brown ones and lay(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) eggs for longer and more reliably . ”
the lockdown has led(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to serious disruption(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) of the UK ’s food supply chain , with farmers , producers and wholesalers struggling(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to divert(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) tens of thousands of tonnes of perishable food no longer required(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) by restaurants , pubs , hotels and schools .
Britons spent(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) £ 88 m on fresh eggs as Britons stockpiled(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) staple foods in the four weeks preceding(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) the lockdown , according to data from the British Egg Industry Council .
Over the four weeks leading(#included the end of the decade) to the week ending(#included the end of the decade) 22 March , an estimated(#overlap 2020-05-24 23:13:08) 621 m eggs were sold(#included the end of the decade) – nearly 20 % more than the same time last year when 518 m eggs worth £ 74 m were sold(#included the end of the decade) .
Before the outbreak of coronavirus – , supermarkets were already reporting(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) healthy sales thanks to the popularity of vegetarian and flexitarian diets .
But initial panic(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) buying(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) led(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to some supermarkets to impose(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) shopper restrictions(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) on purchases(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) of eggs .
Retailer John Lewis said(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) egg cups were selling(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) out as consumers , with time for a sit(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) breakfast , took(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) to boiling(#before 2020-05-24 23:13:08) eggs again .
