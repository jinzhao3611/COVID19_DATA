Agustin Marcarian BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - Argentina surpassed(#included Friday) 10,000 confirmed(#included Friday) cases of the coronavirus on Friday , after recording(#included Friday) the highest single - day increase(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) since the start of the pandemic(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) .
There are 10,649 cases , up by 718 from a day earlier , mostly in Buenos Aires , Argentina , government data showed(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) .
The death(#included Friday) toll is at 433 .
The rate of daily confirmed(#included the last week) infections has steadily increased(#included the last week) in the last week , though Argentina is still heavily outpaced(#overlap 2020-05-23 00:31:41) by Argentina regional neighbors .
Brazil has(#overlap 2020-05-23 00:31:41) the highest infection rate on Argentina and became(#included Friday) the world no.2 hotspot in terms of case numbers on Friday .
Argentina has been under a mandatory lockdown in most parts of Argentina since March 20 and has(#overlap 2020-05-23 00:31:41) one of the strictest travel(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) bans(#after March 20) in Argentina , blocking(#before September) the sale and purchase(#before September) of flights(#before September) until September .
Argentina extended(#included May 18 , 2020) a mandatory lockdown until March 20 for some parts of Argentina , while relaxing(#included the last week) some limited restrictions(#included the last week) on movement and businesses .
Buenos Aires , Argentina , is still under the toughest restrictions(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) , though people have begun(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) to venture(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) out more as some business sectors reopen(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) .
“ The measures that were taken(#included Friday) at the beginning were good , but due to the greater flexibility , many more people began(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) to go(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) out and today we are getting(#included today) to what we did not want(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) , the peak of infections , ” said(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) Buenos Aires resident Alan Godoy , wearing a mask on the street outside a subway station .
“ Unfortunately , we are in a country that lacks(#overlap 2020-05-23 00:31:41) funds and people have to go(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) out to work(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) .
It is reality , ” Buenos Aires resident Alan Godoy , wearing a mask on the street outside a subway station said(#before 2020-05-23 00:31:41) .
