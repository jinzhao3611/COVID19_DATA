proposed is aimed(#overlap 2020-05-10 04:00:44) at avoiding(#before 2020-05-10 04:00:44) a messy default(#included the coming days) that would revive(#after 2020-05-10 04:00:44) memories of an acrimonious , more than decade - long battle(#before 2020-05-10 04:00:44) with creditors after a major default(#included 2001) in 2001 .
