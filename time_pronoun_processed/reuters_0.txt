The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has cut(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) demand and a month - long price war(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) between Saudi Arabia and Russia has left(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) the market awash in crude .

“ That ’s a pretty clear sign that Saudi Arabia are open to cutting(#included 2020-05) production(#included 2020-05) in May , ” U.S. President Donald Trump said(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) .

Russian President Vladimir Putin put(#included 2020-04-03) the blame for the crash(#included 2020-04-03) in prices on Saudi Arabia on Friday - prompting(#included 2020-04-03) a response(#included 2020-04-04) from Riyadh the following(#Depend-on 6:16 p.m.) day disputing(#included 2020-04-04) Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s assertions(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) .
OPEC and its allies are working(#overlap 2020-04-05 23:00:10) on a global agreement(#after 2020-04-05 23:00:10) for an unprecedented oil production(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) cut(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) equivalent to around 10 % of worldwide supply in what OPEC and its allies expect(#overlap 2020-04-05 23:00:10) to be a global effort including(#overlap 2020-04-05 23:00:10) countries that do not exert(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) state control over output , such as U.S. .
U.S. President Donald Trump has , however , made(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) no commitment to take(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) the extraordinary step of persuading(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) U.S. companies to cut(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) output .

“ It is not strange for the market to hike(#included 2020-03-30) prices by enthusiasm such as Friday ’s , but for the levels to stay(#included 2020-05) stable for more than a day or two , the market takes(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) concrete developments(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) and deals on the ground , ” Per Magnus Nysveen , head of analysis at Rystad Energy , said(#before 2020-04-05 23:00:10) .
