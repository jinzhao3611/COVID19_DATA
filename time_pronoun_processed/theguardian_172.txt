, ” Söder said(#before 2020-04-21 09:17:29) .
“ As long as there is no vaccination(#before 2020-04-21 09:17:29) , we need(#overlap 2020-04-21 09:17:29) to be very sensible .
We are in mutual agreement(#overlap 2020-04-21 09:17:29) that the risk is quite simply too high … compromises will not help(#before 2020-04-21 09:17:29) . ”
