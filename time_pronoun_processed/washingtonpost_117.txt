Although they were speaking(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) about putting(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) human lives at risk , they sounded(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) totally casual .
they ultimately apologized(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) , but what is at stake is more than that single TV debate .
that single TV debate unveiled(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) an attitude that has been prevalent throughout French history .
The subtext of the conversation(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) was clear(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) .
that single TV debate conveyed(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) a view that the bodies of Africans and sex workers are not valued(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) in Africans and sex workers own right .
No mention(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) of consent appeared(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) during the talk(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) .
the bodies of Africans and sex workers were presented(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) as disposable subjects for any experimentation(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) that could be helpful to the Western world .
an attitude that has been prevalent throughout French history has(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) a lot to do with the history of France , and more generally of the construction(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) of patriarchy and white supremacy .
For centuries , enslaved(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) and colonized(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) bodies have been exploited(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) for the purpose of so - called science .
Numerous women were tortured(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) by scientists so that colonial states could enjoy(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) the progresses of medicine .
Numerous women include(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) the American doctor James Marion Sims , known as the founder of the modern gynecology .
the American doctor James Marion Sims , known as the founder of the modern gynecology research(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) was based(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) on experiments(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) performed(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) on the bodies of enslaved black women , who endured(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) atrocities(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) in order to help(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) the American doctor James Marion Sims , known as the founder of the modern gynecology create(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) tools that are still part of medicine today .
Similar abuses(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) took(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) place throughout French history and lasted(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) even beyond the colonial era .
In France , Saartjie Baartman — a woman from South Africa who became famous for her features , which were then seen as “ exotic ” and even erotic — was relentlessly exposed(#included the early 19th century) in fairs in the early 19th century , becoming(#included the early 19th century) a symbol of racist dehumanization(#included the early 19th century) .
After Saartjie Baartman — a woman from South Africa who became famous for her features , which were then seen as “ exotic ” and even erotic — death(#included 1815) in 1815 , her body was dissected(#included the early 19th century) .
her body stayed(#included 1996) on display at the Museum of Mankind in Paris until the mid-1970s .
These attitudes are not just part of colonial history .
As recently as 1996 , the pharmaceutical company Pfizer conducted(#included 1996) a meningitis drug trial on children in Nigeria ; 11 children who took(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) part in a meningitis drug trial on children in Nigeria died(#included recently) , and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer faced(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) a lawsuit and eventually settled(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) .
Nowadays , the bodies of sex workers and Africans are still seen(#included today) as other , whether sex workers and Africans are migrants(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) unwanted by the Western world or prostitutes criminalized(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) instead of being supported(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) .
The exploitation(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) of the bodies of sex workers and Africans is used(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) to reinforce(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) the structures of power created(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) by colonization , enslavement(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) and patriarchy .
In the midst of the spread of the covid-19 pandemic(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) , many African nations can not afford(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) not to access(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) treatments that could save(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) many African nations populations from tragedy .
But many African nations have(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) many African nations own scientists , and it is up to many African nations governments to decide(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) whether the tests(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) are timely and appropriate .
It is time to remove(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) the colonial lens so that Africans settle(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) policies(#before 2020-04-08 12:05:51) on Africans own terms and remain(#overlap 2020-04-08 12:05:51) in charge of Africans destinies .
