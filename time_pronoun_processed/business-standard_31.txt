2020-03-23 21:05:50 +00:00 .
Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound said(#included 2020-03-30) Monday a postponement(#included PRESENT_REF) of this year 's Tokyo Olympics is now inevitable as the world reels(#included PRESENT_REF) from the pandemic(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
IOC said(#included 2020-04-05) on Sunday the body would wait(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 21:05:50) four more weeks before announcing(#included 2020-04-05) IOC decision(#included 2020-07-24) on the fate of the July 24 - August 9 Games , amid mounting(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) calls(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) for the July 24 - August 9 Games to be rescheduled(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound however believes(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) IOC is now laying(#included PRESENT_REF) the groundwork for a postponement(#after 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
" Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound interpretation of IOC communications(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) is IOC do n't want(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) to cancel(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) , and IOC do n't think(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) IOC can continue(#included 2020) with the July 24 date , " Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound told(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) AFP . "
So you 're looking(#included PRESENT_REF) at the ' P ' word - postponement(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
" IOC 're going(#included PRESENT_REF) to explore(#after 2020-03-23 21:05:50) options with the Japanese of course , and then there all kinds of stakeholders -- international federations , NOCs , athletes .
"
And then in four weeks IOC 're going(#after 2020-03-23 21:05:50) to try(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) and come(#after 2020-03-23 21:05:50) out with a plan B and make(#after 2020-03-23 21:05:50) a plan B as specific as IOC can make(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) a plan B in that time period . "
Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound said(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) the " astonishing " spread of COVID-19 across the globe left(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) IOC with no other choice .
" the " astonishing " spread of COVID-19 across the globe is not something that 's going(#included 2020) to clear(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) up by July 24 , " Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound said(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
" And the " astonishing " spread of COVID-19 across the globe is n't going(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) to go(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) away by September or October .
A lot of the biggest countries in the globe are just about overwhelmed(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) , and the " astonishing " spread of COVID-19 across the globe 's just starting(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) to take(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) root in Africa .
It 's a no(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) in my view .
" A one - year postponement to 2021 remained(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) the most likely option , Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound added(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
" Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound think(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) A one - year postponement to 2021 is the most feasible because A one - year postponement to 2021 gives(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) you the most time to organise(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:05:50) , " Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound said(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
A number of Olympic committees and sports federations have already indicated(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) unwillingness to participate(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) in Tokyo if the July 24 - August 9 Games are held(#included 2020-07-24) in July as planned(#after 2020-03-23 21:05:50) .
On Sunday the Canadian Olympic Committee became(#included 2020-03-30) the first national olympic committee to declare(#included 2020-03-30) the Canadian Olympic Committee would not participate(#before 2020-03-23 21:05:50) if the July 24 - August 9 Games took(#included 2020) place in July .
