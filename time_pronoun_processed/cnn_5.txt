Fact check:(#overlap 2020-04-02 18:09:59) Georgia governor says(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) we only just learned(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) people without symptoms could spread(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) coronavirus. Experts have been saying(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) spread for months .
2020-04-02 18:09:59 +00:00 .
Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said(#included 2020-04-01) on Wednesday that new information on the spread of coronavirus influenced(#included 2020-04-01) Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp decision(#included 2020-04-01) to issue(#included 2020-04-01) a stay - at - home order .
In particular , Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp pointed(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) to what Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) was the recent discovery(#included recent) that coronavirus can be spread(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) by people who are not exhibiting(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) symptoms .
" What Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp 've been telling(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) people from directives(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) from the CDC for weeks now that if you start(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) feeling(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) bad stay(#overlap 2020-04-02 18:09:59) home , people could have been infecting(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) people before people ever felt(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) bad .
But Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp did n't know(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) infecting until the last 24 hours , " said(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp .
Facts
First : It 's not true that people did n't know(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) " until the last 24 hours " that individuals without symptoms could be infecting(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) people with coronavirus .
Dr. Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , said(#included mid - February) in mid - February that asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus was possible .
Furthermore , studies from as early as January showed(#included March 30) cases of coronavirus spreading(#included PRESENT_REF) amongst people with no symptoms .
Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp press secretary said(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was referring(#included 2020-04-01) to an update(#included March 30) that the CDC made(#included March 30) to its guidance on March 30 that indicated(#included March 30) there 's a higher risk of people without symptoms passing(#after 2020-04-02 18:09:59) on coronavirus .
its guidance on March 30 changed(#included 2020-04-01) the period of exposure risk for individuals from " onset(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) of symptoms " to " 48 hours before symptom onset(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) . "
As more has been learned(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) about coronavirus , several experts told(#included last month) Atlanta ( CNN ) last month that it 's become(#included last month) clear that transmission by people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic is responsible for more transmission than previously thought(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) .
Though it was n't the first time Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp acknowledged(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) it , Dr. Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , confirmed(#included last month) that suspicion in a March 30 interview(#included March 30) with Atlanta ( CNN ) affiliate WABE , in which Dr. Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , said(#included 2020-04-01) " as many as 25 % " of individuals who are infected(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) with coronavirus may remain(#overlap 2020-04-02 18:09:59) asymptomatic .
" One of the [ pieces of ] information that Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp have(#included PRESENT_REF) pretty much confirmed(#included PRESENT_REF) now is that a significant number of individuals that are infected actually remain(#overlap 2020-04-02 18:09:59) asymptomatic , " Dr. Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , said(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) .
" There 's been good communication with Atlanta ( CNN ) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp colleagues to confirm(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) asymptomatic infection , to confirm(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) asymptomatic transmission , to be able to get(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) a better handle on the clinical spectrum of illness in China , " Dr. Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , said(#included 2020-04-01) .
" What we do n't know(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) though is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) transmission . "
The potential for asymptomatic transmission is something(#included March 30) that Dr. Anthony Fauci , the country 's top infectious disease expert , first raised(#included two months ago) two months ago .
In late January , Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and a member of President Donald Trump 's coronavirus task force , told(#included late January) Atlanta ( CNN ) , " There 's no doubt(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) after reading(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) this paper that asymptomatic transmission is occurring(#included March 30) .
" this paper is a study published on January 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Public health experts have since said(#included 2020-04-01) a study published on January 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine was flawed(#included January) , because a patient who was said(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) to be asymptomatic actually had(#included last month) mild symptoms .
Yet the latest update(#included PRESENT_REF) to the the CDC site also cites(#included February) several studies from mid - February and March documenting(#included February) coronavirus in asymptomatic patients .
its guidance on March 30 clarifies(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) that " although transmission of SARS - CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre - symptomatic persons has been reported(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) , risk of transmission is thought(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) to be greatest when patients are symptomatic . "
" Until you really understand(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) how many people are asymptomatic and asymptomatically passing(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) coronavirus on , we think(#included February) it 's better for the entire American public to know(#overlap 2020-04-02 18:09:59) that the risk of serious illness may be low , " a member of President Donald Trump 's coronavirus task force said(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) , " but the entire American public could be potentially spreading(#before 2020-04-02 18:09:59) coronavirus to others .
