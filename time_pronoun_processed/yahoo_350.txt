Like other coronaviruses , the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted(#included now) from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) out , coughs(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) or sneezes .

the spread of the new coronavirus has raised(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) concerns inside the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that the close interactions among people from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank 189 member countries at 'virtual' Spring Meetings could inadvertently contribute(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) to the problem .
Officials from both institutions and member governments said(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) that talk(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) of canceling(#before 2020-02-27 00:14:13) 'virtual' Spring Meetings outright is premature , but Officials from both institutions and member governments are considering(#overlap 2020-02-27 00:14:13) several options to modify(#after 2020-02-27 00:14:13) 'virtual' Spring Meetings .
