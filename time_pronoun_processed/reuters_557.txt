The disruptions(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) to supply chains caused(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) by the new coronavirus have prompted(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) neighbouring(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) Romania to ban(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) cereal exports to non - European Union destinations .
Another neighbour , Russia has also limited(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) grain exports and sold(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) grain from Another neighbour , Russia stockpile to increase(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) supply to Another neighbour , Russia flour millers and bakers .
Ukraine has exported(#included 2019/20) 18 million tonnes of wheat so far in 2019/20 , leaving(#included 2019/20) an additional 2 million tonnes available for export over the rest of this season that runs(#before June 30) until June 30 , in line with a memorandum signed with traders .
“ If the pace of exports becomes(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) such that Ukraine are exporting(#included April) 2 million tonnes in April , so , as Ukraine agreed(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) ( with traders ) and warned(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) - Ukraine will have to implement(#after 2020-04-15 10:22:02) the paragraph of a memorandum signed with traders to stop(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) exports , ” Taras Vysotskiy told(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) KIEV ( Reuters ) - Ukraine , one of world ’s top grain exporters , .
“ So far , the pace of exports looks(#included April) like Ukraine are not going(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) to exceed(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) 2 million tonnes , ” Taras Vysotskiy said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) in a video interview(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) .
Ukraine ’s wheat harvest(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) largely exceeds(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:22:02) domestic consumption , but last month Ukrainian bakers and millers asked(#included July 14 , 2016) Ukraine to limit(#included last month) grain exports to maintain(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) bread prices .
Ukraine said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) Ukraine would limit(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) the export of some food products but so far has only halted(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) foreign sales(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) of the popular staple buckwheat .
Ukraine has also asked(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) parliament to approve(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) lifting(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) import duties on some cereals .
Looking(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:22:02) ahead , Taras Vysotskiy said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) Ukraine ’s 2020/21 wheat exports could fall(#included 2019) sharply to 12 - 15 million tonnes from around 20 million in 2019/20 following(#included 2019) a reduction(#included 2019) in the sowing(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:22:02) area caused(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) by poor weather .
DRY WEATHER AND FROST Ukraine has imposed(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) strict lockdown measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic , but Taras Vysotskiy said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) strict lockdown measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic had not affected(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) the spring sowing(#included last month) , which had taken(#included last month) place at an even faster pace than a year ago .
Ukraine harvested(#included 2019) a record 75.1 million tonnes of grain in 2019 and exports could reach all - time high of 52 - 55 million tonnes in the 2019/20 season which runs(#included 2019) from July to June , Taras Vysotskiy said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) .
However , after a record harvest last month , the deputy economy minister in charge of agriculture said(#included last month) a lack of rain during sowing(#included last month) late last year and unfavourable weather conditions this spring would lead(#included 2019) to a smaller wheat harvest(#included 2019) and lower exports .
“ We had(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) three very dry months and high temperatures and frosts .
It rained(#included last month) across Ukraine , which improved(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) the situation a bit , but of course we will not match(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) the record harvest this year , ” Taras Vysotskiy said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) .
Ukraine had sowed(#included July) 2.7 million hectares of spring crops as of April 10 , or 18 % of the expected(#included 2019) sowing area of 15.3 million hectares .
Taras Vysotskiy said(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) the forecast for the grain harvest for 2020 has repeatedly changed(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) depending(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) on the weather .
the forecast for the grain harvest for 2020 is now at 65 - 67 million tonnes but may drop(#after 2020-04-15 10:22:02) to 60 million if the weather deteriorates(#before 2020-04-15 10:22:02) .
