Amazon must limit(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) deliveries in France to IT products , health items , food and pet food , the Court of Appeal in Versailles said(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) , adding(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) that for every delivery(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) not meeting(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) limit , Amazon would face(#after 2020-04-24 13:52:43) a 100,000 - euro ( $ 108,020.00 ) penalty .
Confirming(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) ruling limiting Amazon deliveries during COVID-19 crisis , the Court of Appeal in Versailles said(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) limit must be put(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) in place while U.S. online retailer Amazon ’s ( AMZN.O ) evaluates(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) and improves(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) U.S. online retailer Amazon ’s ( AMZN.O ) health measures to prevent(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) the 10,000 people U.S. online retailer Amazon ’s ( AMZN.O ) employs(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) at six warehouses to catch(#after 2020-04-24 13:52:43) the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) outbreak .
“ We ’ll evaluate(#after 2020-04-24 13:52:43) the consequences of rejected for We ’ll business , We ’ll employees , We ’ll customers in France , and the many small and medium - sized companies that rely(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) on Amazon to grow(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) their business , ” We ’ll said(#included Friday) in a written(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) statement .
We ’ll closed(#included April 16) We ’ll warehouses in the country on April 16 .
We ’ll extended(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) the closure of its French warehouses twice and said(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) We ’ll would be shut(#before April 25) until April 25 inclusive .
We ’ll is facing(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) mounting(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) scrutiny as We ’ll juggles(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) a surge(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) in online orders(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) during government lockdowns(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) worldwide to curb(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) the pandemic(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) and employees ’ safety , and France has become(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) a major battleground(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) .
The legal battle in France highlighted(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) how companies may struggle(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) to keep(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) going(#Depend-on 2020-04-24 13:52:43) while protecting(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) companies workers , just as firms across Europe need(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) to figure(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) out how to let(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) staff safely return(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) to offices and factories once restrictions(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) are lifted(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) .
The legal battle in France has also accentuated(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) losses(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) for some French businesses that were still managing(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) to sell(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) and ship(#before 2020-04-24 13:52:43) through Amazon , in spite of a furore(#overlap 2020-04-24 13:52:43) over whether some goods are really essential .
