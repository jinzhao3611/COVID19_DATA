REUTERS / Issei Kato / File Photo also plans(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to get(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) all its 320 swimmers together for a five - week special event of training and competition , possibly filmed(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) behind closed doors and with Australia the likely location , from Oct. 14 - Nov. 17 subject to the COVID-19 pandemic(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) .
Hungary ’s 2016 triple Olympic gold medallist Katinka Hosszu told(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) Reuters the ‘ Solidarity Program ’ would provide(#included 2016) peace of mind at a time of uncertainty , with some countries in lockdown(#included 2016) as some countries battle(#overlap 2020-04-03 19:54:33) the new coronavirus .
“ For all its 320 swimmers , it ’s really important to get(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) over this period of time and everyone will be able to prepare(#included 2020-SU) for next summer , ” Hungary ’s 2016 triple Olympic gold medallist Katinka Hosszu said(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) .
“ all its 320 swimmers have(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) some security as well as some racing(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) and training camps to look(#overlap 2020-04-03 19:54:33) forward to . ”
The Tokyo , Japan Games , originally scheduled(#included July) to start(#included July) in July this year , have been postponed(#included July) to July 23 - Aug. 8 , 2021 due to the pandemic .
ISL launched(#included 2020-04-03) last year as a fast - paced competition with 10 teams from Europe and North America featuring(#included 2020-04-03) an array of world and Olympic champions and bankrolled(#included 2020-04-03) by Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Grigorishin .
Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , liked(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) the idea of doing ISL again but stopped(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) short of committing(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to a return(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) , due in part to uncertainty with Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , existing(#overlap 2020-04-03 19:54:33) sponsorships .
“ Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , do n’t know(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) that far in advance what Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , schedule is going(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to be like ... or how the companies I am involved with at the moment what the companies I am involved with at the moment are going(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to need(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) from Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , within those months , ” Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , told(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) Reuters .
“ Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , mean(#Depend-on 2020-04-03 19:54:33) , Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , would love(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to compete(#included 2016) in ISL , it was great last year , but Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , ca n’t say(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) 100 % Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , am doing this because there are just so many uncertainties right now for everybody . ”
Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Grigorishin told(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) Reuters all its 320 swimmers would each get(#included 2016) a guaranteed(#included 2016) $ 1,500 a month from Sept. 1 to July 1 with $ 11 million set(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) aside to cover(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) wages , bonuses , ambassador payments(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) and prize money in a condensed season .
The total cost of paying(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) for everything could amount(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to $ 20 million , although amount could be reduced(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) by television deals and sponsorship and depends(#overlap 2020-04-03 19:54:33) on the planned five - week ‘ radical swimming event ’ going(#included 2016) ahead .
“ During this five weeks we will organise(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) 10 matches , like prelims , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Grigorishin .
“ And maybe one month later we organise(#included July) finals , just one match(#included July) for four teams .
This is we ideal scenario .
“ But it ’s hard to say(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) .
It ’s not easy to travel(#included PRESENT_REF) now and maybe there will be a lot of restrictions(#included PRESENT_REF) .
So we have to find(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) some place for all its 320 swimmers to collect(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) all its 320 swimmers together .
“ Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , think(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) there will still be some restrictions(#included PRESENT_REF) on big public events to the end of the year so for that reason maybe we have to organise(#after 2020-04-03 19:54:33) the planned five - week ‘ radical swimming event ’ in TV show format without spectators . ”
Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel , who competed in the inaugural ISL season , said(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) Australia , Budapest , Japan or Florida were options with Australia the frontrunner : “ We asked(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) swimmers and coaches about swimmers and coaches preferences and the majority liked(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) Australia . ”
the pandemic has put(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) the sporting calendar on hold , with many athletes forced(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) to train(#before 2020-04-03 19:54:33) at home .
The European aquatics championships that were scheduled(#included 2019-05) for Budapest in May have been postponed(#included 2019-05) to August , subject to review(#included PRESENT_REF) .
