SEOUL ( Reuters ) -
A South Korean tabletop exercise on emergency responses to a fictional mysterious outbreak led(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) directly to tools the country deployed(#included March 15 , 2020) less than a month later to manage(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) the arrival(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) and spread of the coronavirus , one of the experts involved said(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .

According to an undisclosed government document seen by Reuters , on Dec. 17 two dozen leading(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) South Korean infectious diseases specialists tackled(#included December) a worrying scenario : a South Korean family contracts(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) pneumonia after a trip(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) to China , where cases of an unidentified disease had arisen(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
an unidentified disease quickly spreads(#overlap 2020-03-30 04:18:56) among the colleagues of the family members and medical workers who treated(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) them .
In response(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) , the experts involved developed(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) an algorithm to find(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) the pathogen and the pathogen origin , as well as testing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) techniques .
Those measures(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) were mobilized(#included Dec. 17) in real life when a first suspected(#included over) coronavirus patient appeared(#included Jan. 20) in South Korea's on Jan. 20 , an undisclosed government document seen by Reuters said(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
“ Looking(#included over) back over the past 20 years , humans were most tormented(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) by either influenza or coronaviruses , and we ’re relatively doing well on influenza but had been worried(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) about the possibility of the outbreak(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) of a novel coronavirus , ” said(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) Lee Sang - won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill .
“ It was blind luck - we were speechless to see(#included Dec. 17) a worrying scenario become(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) reality , ” Lee Sang - won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill added(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
“ But A South Korean tabletop exercise on emergency responses to a fictional mysterious outbreak helped(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) we save(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) much time developing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) testing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) methodology and identifying(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) cases . ”
A South Korean tabletop exercise on emergency responses to a fictional mysterious outbreak played(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) a key role in slowing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) what became(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China using(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) aggressive and sustained testing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
After a big early outbreak(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) , South Korea's rolled(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) out widespread testing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) within days , launching(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) an extensive program to test(#overlap 2020-03-30 04:18:56) people who do not have(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) symptoms but may be able to infect(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) others , isolate confirmed patients and trace(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) confirmed patients contacts .
South Korea's won(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) praise for containing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) the spread of Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China with comparatively little disruption(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
South Korea's has(#overlap 2020-03-30 04:18:56) 9,583 cases and 158 deaths(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) , and managed(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) to bring(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) the daily tally of new infections to about 100 or fewer for the past three weeks .
The the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) team , which Lee Sang - won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill said(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) was formed(#included 2018) in 2018 as a sort of study group , had wanted(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) to boost(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) large - scale DNA analysis(#included 2018) capabilities after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) earned(#included 2015) much public criticism for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) handling of a 2015 outbreak(#included 2015) of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome .
Soon after the drill , Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China emerged(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) in the Chinese city of Wuhan , prompting(#included over) the experts involved to begin(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) considering(#overlap 2020-03-30 04:18:56) that Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China might be a novel coronavirus .
Even before Beijing officially declared(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China , the South Korean team was ready to begin(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) testing(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) , Lee Sang - won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill said(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
an undisclosed government document seen by Reuters also showed(#included Jan. 4) the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) established(#included Jan. 4) testing(#included Jan. 4) methodology on Jan. 4 , three days before Chinese authorities identified(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China , and started(#included Jan. 9) testing(#included Jan. 9) suspected(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) cases on Jan. 9 .
By early March , South Korea's was capable(#included early March) of running(#included early March) as many as 20,000 tests(#included 2015) a day , with five firms churning(#included early March) out kits for domestic use and export .
“ We might be a bit overreacting(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) at that time with just a few domestic infections , but there were substantial possibilities Asia ’s largest coronavirus epidemic outside China would reach(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) pandemic levels indeed , ” Lee Sang - won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill said(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
“ Have We done well ?
Lee Sang - won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill do n’t know(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) .
But We did n’t want(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) to repeat(#before 2020-03-30 04:18:56) what We went(#included 2015) through in 2015 - We motto was ‘ never again . ’
