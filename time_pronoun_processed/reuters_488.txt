Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , estimates(#included last year) Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , had(#included last year) a million day - trip visitors last year , before the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) halted(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) international tourism .
Other European hotspots once suffocated(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) by selfie - snapping visitors face(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:35:58) a similar fate .
Most tourists came(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) on bus tours(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) stopping(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) for a view that gained(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) renown in Asia thanks to a South Korean TV series filmed(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) there and a partial replica here of Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , built(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) in China .
Nestled(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) in the Salzkammergut region of lakes and mountains east of Salzburg , Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , often attracted(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) attention for efforts to restrict(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) the number of buses stopping(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:35:58) there and to monetize(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) those short visits(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) , such as by charging(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) 1 euro to use(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) the toilet .
Now Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , wonders(#included Now) when Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , will face(#included Now) that challenge again .
“ Recently that challenge was too much , and that challenge was perceived(#included Recently) as too much and as a curse(#included last year) , and Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , kept(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) taking(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) measures , ” Hallstatt ’s Mayor Alexander Scheutz said(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) .
Austria acted(#included six weeks ago) early in the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) outbreak to shut(#included six weeks ago) restaurants , bars , non - essential shops , museums and other gathering places six weeks ago .
shut helped(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) flatten(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) the curve of infections , which are increasing(#included Now) at less than 1 % daily .
Austria said(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) that justified a step - by - step loosening(#included last year) of the lockdown(#included last year) , starting(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) with DIY and garden centres as well as smaller shops , which were allowed(#included two weeks ago) to reopen(#included two weeks ago) two weeks ago .
Restaurants , cafes and bars are due(#included May 15) to reopen(#included May 15) on May 15 , followed(#included May 15) by hotels on May 29 .
But the borders remain(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:35:58) essentially closed(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) in a country heavily reliant(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:35:58) on tourism .
“ We in Hallstatt of course depend(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) 95 % on foreign guests ... from Asia , from America , from England and from the surrounding European countries , ” said(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) Markus - Paul Derbl , who owns(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) a restaurant , souvenir shop and other businesses .
“ If the borders stay(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) closed(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) it will be very , very difficult to keep(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) business going(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:35:58) properly . ”
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has said(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hopes(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) the border with Germany - Austria ’s biggest source of foreign tourists - will reopen(#included Now) soon , but Germany has been cool on hopes .
It is unlikely Germans alone could fill(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) the gap for Leonhard Foeger Hallstatt , population 780 , .
“ That is rather hopeless perhaps
but Chancellor Sebastian Kurz do think(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) We in Hallstatt have(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) a name and are known(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) , and of course We in Hallstatt are glad when guests from Germany come(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) here , ” Hallstatt ’s Mayor Alexander Scheutz said(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) .
" If Hallstatt ’s Mayor Alexander Scheutz had to give(#before 2020-04-28 14:35:58) a prediction ( for the summer ) it would be a very sad , bad one
but Hallstatt ’s Mayor Alexander Scheutz am an optimistic person - the landscape is beautiful , We in Hallstatt are a ( UNESCO ) World Heritage site whc.unesco.org/en/list/806 , the people are welcoming(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:35:58) . "
