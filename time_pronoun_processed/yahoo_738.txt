( Bloomberg ) -- New York State ’s lockdown has reduced(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the rate of spread for the coronavirus to under one new infection for every existing(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) one , an important milestone that could mean(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the outbreak(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) is shrinking(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) , Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
But even as Governor Andrew Cuomo credited(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) New Yorkers for altering(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) New Yorkers behavior , Governor Andrew Cuomo implored(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) New Yorkers to continue(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) keeping(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) New Yorkers distance from one another to prevent(#after 2020-04-16 18:35:36) a resurgence(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) , after warning(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) previously that there would be multiple waves of outbreak(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
Governor Andrew Cuomo also announced(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) that Governor Andrew Cuomo was extending(#included at) New York State ’s lockdown at least another month , to at least May 15 .
“ What determines(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the rate of infection ?
You do and I do , ” Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#included Thursday) Thursday at Governor Andrew Cuomo daily virus briefing(#included Thursday) .
“ the rate of infection came(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) down because people changed(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) people behavior(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
changed ’s what happened(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) . ”
Governor Andrew Cuomo reported(#included the previous day) 606 new deaths(#included the previous day) in 24 hours , down from 752 the previous day .
reported raised(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the state ’s death(#included Thursday) toll to 12,192 .
But other data suggest(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) New York State is slowly turning(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) a corner .
The number of hospitalized(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) patients fell(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) below 18,000 for the first time in 10 days , declining(#included Thursday) for the fourth consecutive day .
Intensive - care admissions(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) and intubations , in which patients are placed(#after 2020-04-16 18:35:36) on ventilators to help(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) patients breathe(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) , also declined(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
The number of new hospitalizations ticked(#included Thursday) down .
And in a continued(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) sign that New York State believes(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the worst of the crisis(#included Thursday) is over , New York State sent(#included Thursday) 100 of the ventilators New York State had amassed(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) to New Jersey , after sending(#included Thursday) 150 to other states Wednesday .
Separately , New York State reported(#included Wednesday) 8,505 new infections from Wednesday , a high number to be sure but more in line with recent trends after a spike above 11,000 the previous day .
Infections remain(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) stubbornly high , even as the hospital system has managed(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) to get(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the case load under control .
But Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the infection rate , which measures(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the number of new patients infected(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) by existing(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) ones , was showing(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) signs of stabilizing(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) and even moving(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) toward a decline(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
Getting(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) below the threshold of every infected person infecting(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) one other person is an important milestone .
Above a rate of one - to - one means an outbreak is growing(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) , while below an outbreak means an outbreak ’s contracting(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
Still , arriving(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) at such data requires(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) extensive testing(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) , tracing(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) and modeling of the virus , which New York and other states have said(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) New York and other states lack(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the money and staffing to do -- raising(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) questions about how precise Cuomo ’s analysis(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) is .
While talk has turned(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) to New Yorkers going(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) back to work(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) and resuming(#before May 15) a more normal way of life , Governor Andrew Cuomo ’s extension of the Pause Act until at least May 15 makes(#before May 15) clear that is still some way off , giving(#included Wednesday) more time for infections to decline(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) and for other positive trends to take(#after 2020-04-16 18:35:36) root(#overlap 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
Governor Andrew Cuomo left(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) open the possibility that New York State ’s lockdown could be extended(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) further , saying(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) Governor Andrew Cuomo would make(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) that assessment when the time came(#included Wednesday) .
“ The rate of infection is everything , ” Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) , noting(#included Wednesday) that the trajectory of infections has been far lower than what expert modeling had initially predicted(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) .
“ Cuomo ’s controlled(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) the beast , Cuomo ’s brought(#before 2020-04-16 18:35:36) The rate of infection down . ”
