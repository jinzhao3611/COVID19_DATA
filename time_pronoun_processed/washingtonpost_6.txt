Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , also presided(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) over two trials(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) of the bombing(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) ’s mastermind , Ramzi Yousef , who is serving(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:07:27) a life sentence after his conviction(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) in bomb and a plot to blow(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) up a dozen U.S. airliners over the Far East .

“ Prior to February 26th , 1993 , the United States was a much freer place , ” Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , told(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) four men convicted(#included 1993) at the 1993 trial .
“ Now we have(#included Now) guards .
Now we have(#included Now) an identification - card mentality .
an identification - card mentality ’s not quite as free(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) . ”
After one defendant complained(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) that prison guards had not given(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) one defendant prayer beads and rugs , Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , replied(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) : “ one defendant . ...
You ’re not some guy on vacation . ”
“ You talk(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) about the Koran , ” Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , told(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) another defendant .
“ You have shamed(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) the Koran . ...
You violated(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) the laws not only of man , but God . ”
At a sentencing(#included 1993) years later , Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , called(#included 1983) Yousef , the 1993 bombing ’s mastermind , an “ apostle of evil . ’’
Besides All three trials , Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , had(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) other high - profile proceedings(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) , including(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) the trial of Paul Castellano , who allegedly headed the Gambino organized crime family before he was assassinated outside a Manhattan steak house after the trial had started .

Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , was at times bombastic(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) .
It took(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) an appeals court only weeks after bomb to reverse(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) as a violation of free speech a gag order barring(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) all prosecutors , investigators , defense attorneys and others from discussing(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) the case .
Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , had threatened(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) to impose(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) fines that would start(#after 2020-04-02 17:07:27) at $ 200 for a first offense and increase(#after 2020-04-02 17:07:27) exponentially to $ 1.6 billion by a third offense .
Yet , Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , used(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) a folksy demeanor with jurors , making(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) jurors feel at ease with plain talk .
After a jury was chosen(#included 1993) for the trial of Paul Castellano , who allegedly headed the Gambino organized crime family before he was assassinated outside a Manhattan steak house after the trial had started and opening arguments(#included 1993) were about to begin(#included 1993) , Duffy , appointed to the bench in 1972 by President Richard Nixon , offered(#included 1993) jurors the chance to quit(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) a jury for no reason at all if jurors did n’t want(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) to be there .
No one quit(#before 2020-04-02 17:07:27) .
