-- When it comes(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) to federal aid for small businesses , U.S. states are learning(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) a lesson already familiar to shoppers on the hunt for toilet paper : It pays to be first in line .
Over the last nine days of March , the Small Business Administration handed(#included the last nine days of March) out 1,790 disaster - relief loans , for a total of $ 357 million , most of 1,790 disaster - relief loans for businesses disrupted(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) by the coronavirus .
1,790 disaster - relief loans were disclosed(#included April 4) April 4 on a government website .
Businesses in all parts of the country were eligible for 1,790 disaster - relief loans , but 1,790 disaster - relief loans show(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) most of the money went(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) to just one state : California .
A handful of smaller states , including(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) Connecticut and Maine , divvied(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) up most of the rest .
California got(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) just six loans worth less than $ 1 million dollars in all ; at least a dozen states , including(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) Missouri , Alabama and Iowa , got(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) nothing at all .
The disparity(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) arose(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) because some states were earlier than others to declare(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) disasters , said(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) Carol Chastang , an SBA spokeswoman , in an email .
Under the rules for 1,790 disaster - relief loans , the Small Business Administration began(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) accepting(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) applications(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) only after a state ’s governor declared(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) a disaster .
California , Washington , Connecticut and Maine acted(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) earliest , and the Small Business Administration authorized(#included March 23) lending there on March 16 .
The other states were added(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) over the next few days , with the last joining(#included March 21) March 21 .
By then , the demand appears to have created(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) a backlog that was n’t quickly cleared(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) when the money started(#included March 23) flowing(#included March 23) on March 21 .
Even on March 31 , the latest day for which data is available , the Small Business Administration was still making(#included March 21) more loans in Maine than in California , Florida and New York combined .
Technology problems may be a factor(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) .
Business owners around the country reported(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) having(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) trouble completing(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) applications on a government website because a government website crashed(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) intermittently .
Carol Chastang , an SBA spokeswoman , in an email said(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) Carol Chastang , an SBA spokeswoman , in an email did n’t have(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) information about whether the numbers are less lopsided for the first week in April .
Carol Chastang , an SBA spokeswoman , in an email said(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) the the Small Business Administration office that would have(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) that information is “ overwhelmed(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) ” with processing(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) loans .
Congress originally freed(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) up enough funding for about $ 7 billion in coronavirus disaster loans , but the stimulus bill passed(#included late March) in late March contained(#included late March) additional funding for the program .
The early results serve(#after 2020-04-07 15:37:26) as a reminder that a much larger SBA program -- the $ 349 billion Paycheck Protection Program , authorized in the stimulus legislation signed March 27 -- may be prone to similar short - term disparities .
a much larger SBA program -- the $ 349 billion Paycheck Protection Program , authorized in the stimulus legislation signed March 27 -- offers(#overlap 2020-04-07 15:37:26) forgivable loans for keeping(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) employees on the payroll .
a much larger SBA program -- the $ 349 billion Paycheck Protection Program , authorized in the stimulus legislation signed March 27 -- does n’t require(#overlap 2020-04-07 15:37:26) state disaster declarations(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) .
But a much larger SBA program -- the $ 349 billion Paycheck Protection Program , authorized in the stimulus legislation signed March 27 -- does rely(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) on banks to make(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) the loans , and some banks are so inundated(#overlap 2020-04-07 15:37:26) that they ’re(#overlap 2020-04-07 15:37:26) longtime customers over new ones .
The the Small Business Administration computer system that serves(#overlap 2020-04-07 15:37:26) lenders crashed(#included Monday) on Monday on unprecedented volume , leading(#included Monday) to more delays(#before 2020-04-07 15:37:26) .
With many restaurants , shops and other small businesses just days away from insolvency , every day counts(#overlap 2020-04-07 15:37:26) .
