The Metropolitan Police Federation ( MPF ) said(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) that , despite The Metropolitan Police Federation ( MPF ) assertions(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) to the contrary , the government is sending(#overlap 2020-05-10 07:12:51) out mixed messages .
MPF ’s Ken Marsh told(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) BBC Radio 4 that authorities “ needed(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) to be firmer right from the beginning ” .
MPF ’s Ken Marsh said(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) : “ It ’s been quite wishy - washy how MPF ’s gone(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) about it .
Had MPF ’s been very stringent(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) from the off – it is painful , but it ’s not overly painful in terms of what MPF ’s actually being asked(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) to do – then MPF ’s Ken Marsh think(#included now) MPF ’s would have(#included now) a better result now . ”

Prof Stephen Powis , national medical director of NHS England , said(#included Saturday) on Saturday that “ there was a little bit of concern(#included Saturday) ” after the unseasonably warm weather drew(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) big crowds to public spaces .
Scotland Yard sent(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) officers on bikes to keep(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) an eye on London ’s Hyde Park , while North Yorkshire Police revealed(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) that 50 % of shutdown fines(#overlap 2020-05-10 07:12:51) issued(#included Saturday) so far have gone(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) to tourists visiting(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) beauty spots in the area .
revealed came(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) as a diagnostic expert asked(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) to consult(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) on the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app criticised(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app for focusing(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) on coughs(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) and fever at the exclusion(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) of other symptoms .
the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app was being trialled(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) on the Isle of Wight before the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app anticipated roll - out across the rest of the country later this month .
Dr Nick Summerton , a GP with 32 years ’ experience , told(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) the Sunday Mirror the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app risked(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) ignoring(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) 10 symptoms other than fever or cough(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) .
Dr Nick Summerton , a GP with 32 years ’ experience said(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) : “ The first point Dr Nick Summerton , a GP with 32 years ’ experience made(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) was include(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) many more symptoms .
The second was they should talk(#after 2020-05-10 07:12:51) to Tim Spector about symptom clustering work(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) Tim Spector has done .
To ignore(#overlap 2020-05-10 07:12:51) such good work is strange . ”
Tim Spector launched(#included 23 March) the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app on 23 March , with some three million people using(#after 2020-05-10 07:12:51) the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app in Britain and the US since .

, ” Tim Spector told(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) the Sunday Mirror .
“ We should be using(#after 2020-05-10 07:12:51) a combination of symptoms to diagnose(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) this .
a combination of symptoms would save(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) lives .
We are falling(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) behind other countries . ”
the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app requires(#overlap 2020-05-10 07:12:51) smartphone users to download(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app and share(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) data the moment smartphone users test(#before 2020-05-10 07:12:51) positive or display signs of Covid-19 , with the government ’s Covid-19 contact tracing app sending(#included PAST_REF) a notification(#included PAST_REF) to all mobile phone users who have been in recent proximity advising them to self - isolate .
