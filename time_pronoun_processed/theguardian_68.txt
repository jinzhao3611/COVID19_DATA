The Covid-19 puzzles that scientists are still trying(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) to answer(#after 2020-03-14 14:38:08) .
2020-03-14 14:38:08 +00:00 .
Early on Saturday morning the news broke(#included Early) that a newborn baby had tested(#included Early) positive for coronavirus in a London hospital .
a newborn baby is thought(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) to be the youngest affected(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) by the disease in the UK .
The child ’s mother had been admitted(#included Early) to hospital days before the birth with suspected(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) pneumonia .
Tests – at North Middlesex hospital , in Edmonton – revealed(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) The child ’s mother had(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) coronavirus .
Then , minutes after The child ’s mother gave(#included Early) birth , The child ’s mother baby was given(#included Early) a test which was also positive for Covid-19 .
It is not known(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) whether a newborn baby contracted(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) the disease in the womb or was infected(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) during birth .
The case is striking because generally Covid-19 has had(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) very little impact on children or young adults .
The Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said(#included 11 February) The Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention analysis(#included 11 February) , released(#included 11 February) on 11 February , of just under 45,000 cases revealed(#included 11 February) that less than 1 % were under nine years old , while those aged between 10 and 19 accounted(#included than) for just over 1 % .
By contrast , those aged between 50 and 59 made(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) up almost 25 % of the cases while those aged between 10 and 19 made(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) up 19 % .
“ The information suggests(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) that children are less likely to be infected than adults and that is a bit of a puzzle , ” says(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) Professor Jimmy Whitworth , of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine .
One suggestion put(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) forward by researchers is that children have(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) upper - respiratory tract illnesses most of the time .
“ It may be that children are simply not reporting(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) children as feeling(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) ill , ” adds(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) Professor Jimmy Whitworth , of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine .
“ So children are not getting(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) tested(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) .
It could be just a sampling issue(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) . ”
Alternatively , it is possible that other human coronaviruses – which are known to cause minor colds – may be circulating(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) in schools and playgrounds and other human coronaviruses – which are known to cause minor colds – could providing(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) a degree of cross protection against Covid-19 .
“ Or it could be something to do with social mixing(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) , ” says(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) Professor Jimmy Whitworth , of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine .
“ We know(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) children interact(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) mostly with other children and adults mostly interact(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) with adults .
It is not as though the whole of society mixes(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) randomly .
So those differential mixing(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) patterns might explain(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) part of it . ”
The low numbers of Covid-19 infections among children is not the only mystery .
It has been known(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) to science for only a few months and many of its features continue(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) to puzzle(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) experts .
One of many of its features concerns(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) hypertension – high blood pressure .
Studies of Chinese cases suggest(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) that adults with high blood pressure are more at risk of dying(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) from coronavirus than others .
Again scientists find(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) it difficult to find(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) simple explanations(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) .
“ It may be such individuals have(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) other conditions that have not been recognised(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) , ” says(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) Tom Wingfield , a clinician at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine .
“ We know(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) that people with hypertension are more likely to be diabetic and have impaired kidneys , for example .
have could be a factor(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) but the honest answer is that We just do not know(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) at present . ”
Other puzzles about the impact(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) of Covid-19 have(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) simpler explanations , however .
For example , there is Covid-19 tendency to kill(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) men more often than women .
The infection is fatal(#overlap 2020-03-14 14:38:08) for 4.7 % of men , but just 2.8 % of women , even though the gender balance for those testing(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) positive is roughly 50:50 .
Most experts say(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) this is explained(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) by the fact that in China smoking is primarily a male prerogative and this has weakened(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) men ’s respiratory systems and made(#before 2020-03-14 14:38:08) men ’s respiratory systems more vulnerable to Covid-19 .
