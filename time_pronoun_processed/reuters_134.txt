With London in London first week of lockdown(#included This year) , All England Lawn Tennis Club ( AELTC ) officials are weighing(#included This year) up All England Lawn Tennis Club ( AELTC ) officials limited options .
The ‘ build(#included June 29) ’ for LONDON ( Reuters ) - This year ’s Wimbledon Championships is supposed(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) to start(#included June 29) in little over a month but it seems(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) increasingly likely Wimbledon will be forced(#after 2020-03-25 21:28:51) to miss(#after 1945) a year for the first time since 1945 .
“ The AELTC has been contingency(#after 1945) planning since January , working(#after 1945) closely with the UK government and public health authorities to follow(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) the UK government and public health authorities advice and understand(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) the likely impact of COVID-19 and the government ’s emergency(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) measures(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) on LONDON ( Reuters ) - This year ’s Wimbledon Championships , and our thoughts are with all those affected(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) by this crisis at this time , ” The AELTC said in a statement on Wednesday .
“ Based(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) on the advice The AELTC have received(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) from the public health authorities , the very short window available to The AELTC to stage(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) LONDON ( Reuters ) - This year ’s Wimbledon Championships due to the nature of The AELTC surface suggests(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) that postponement(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) is not without significant risk and difficulty , ” The AELTC added(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) .
The AELTC said(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) playing(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) behind closed doors was not an option .
The Australian Open , the year ’s first Grand Slam , was completed(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) before the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) exploded(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) to virtually shut(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) down world sport , including(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) the men ’s ATP Tour and women ’s WTA Tour .
The French Open last week made(#included last week) the decision to move(#included last week) The Australian Open , the year ’s first Grand Slam to Sept. 20 - Oct. 4 from The Australian Open , the year ’s first Grand Slam May start because of the outbreak(#included This year) .
While the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday potentially opened(#included June 29) a two - week slot in the calendar in July / August , it would appear unlikely Wimbledon would use(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday .
Switching(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) to a later time in This year is even less likely(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) as Wimbledon has(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) only two covered courts and elite outdoor grasscourt tennis is not feasible past late summer .
Wimbledon said(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) Wimbledon is communicating(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) closely with the LTA , and with the ATP Tour , ATP Tour , ITF and the other Grand Slams .
But a cancellation(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) looks(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) increasingly likely .
“ The unprecedented challenge(#included This year) presented(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) by this crisis continues(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) to affect(#overlap 2020-03-25 21:28:51) our way of life in ways that we could not have imagined(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) , ” The AELTC chief executive Richard Lewis said(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) .
“ The AELTC thoughts are with all those affected(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) in the UK and around the world .
The single most important consideration(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) is one of public health , and The AELTC are determined(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) to act(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) responsibly through the decisions The AELTC make(#before 2020-03-25 21:28:51) . ”
