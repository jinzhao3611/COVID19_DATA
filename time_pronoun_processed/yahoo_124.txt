Officials are also examining(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) the scope for mergers(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) involving(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) El Al and Israel ’s two other main airlines , Israir Airlines and Arkia Israeli Airlines Ltd. , according to one person , who asked(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) not to be named(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) as the deliberations(#included security) are private .
While radical steps are under consideration(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) , discussions center(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) on government - backed loans that would come(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) in return for an efficiency plan including job losses and salary reductions , another person said(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) , adding(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) that an efficiency plan including job losses and salary reductions could total(#after 2020-03-27 08:39:37) $ 500 million .

Spokespeople for El Al and Israel declined(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) to comment(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) .
The airline , which has(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) 7.1 billion shekels ( $ 2 billion ) in debt , according to data compiled(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) by Bloomberg , is among hundreds worldwide whose future is in doubt(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) as the pandemic spreads(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) .
Carriers could lose(#included this year) $ 252 billion in revenue(#included this year) this year , according to the International Air Transport Association , which says(#overlap 2020-03-27 08:39:37) bailouts of $ 200 billion may be needed(#before 2020-03-27 08:39:37) to save(#after 2020-03-27 08:39:37) the industry .
