In New York , where millions of people are living(#overlap 2020-03-26 00:01:16) under some of the country ’s strictest rules , users have been posting(#before 2020-03-26 00:01:16) as users see(#before 2020-03-26 00:01:16) fit , unsure , as in so many other things , what a local social network is for .

There are still relics of Nextdoor 1.0 : complaints(#before 2020-03-26 00:01:16) about discourteous runners , unverified rumors about what the city may do next and full - on conspiracy theories .
