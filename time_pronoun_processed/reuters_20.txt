Indian rice traders have stopped(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) signing(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) new export contracts amid the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus , as labour shortages and logistics disruptions have hampered(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) the delivery(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) of even existing(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) contracts , industry officials said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) .

The halt in exports from the world ’s biggest exporter is allowing(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) rival countries such as Thailand to raise(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) shipments in the short term and lift(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) global prices , forcing(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) millions of poor consumers in Africa to pay(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) higher prices .
“ Shipments have stalled(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) as transport has become(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) very difficult because of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus .
Drivers are not coming(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) and labour is not available at mills and ports , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) B.V. Krishna Rao , president of the Rice Exporters Association ( REA ) .
Indian traders have stopped(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) offering(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) quotes to overseas buyers as Indian traders are not sure when Indian traders would be able to ship(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) Indian traders cargoes , four top exporters told(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) Reuters .
India ’s export volumes have fallen(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) by four to five times , said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) Prem Garg , chairman of the Lal Mahal Group , which exports(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) rice to more than 44 countries .
India will gradually pull(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) out of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus in phases , Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) .
About 400,000 tonnes of non - basmati rice and 100,000 tonnes of basmati rice , meant(#included 2021-03) for March - April delivery , are either stuck(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) at ports or in the pipeline due to the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus , exporters said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) .
New Delhi mainly exports(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) non - basmati rice to Bangladesh , Nepal , Benin and Senegal , and premium basmati rice to Iran , Saudi Arabia and Iraq .
As Cambodia , Vietnam and Myanmar curbed(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) Cambodia , Vietnam and Myanmar rice exports , demand for Indian rice surged(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) , but traders are not signing(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) new contracts , said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) Nitin Gupta , vice president of trader Olam India ’s rice business .
Thailand , has seen(#included 2020-W14) its export prices soared(#included 2020-W14) to its export prices highest in seven years this week .
Before the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus , India was offering(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) 5 % broken parboiled variety at around $ 365 per tonne free - on - board basis .
Thailand is now been offering(#included PRESENT_REF) the same grade at around $ 540 per tonne .
“ After the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus , there will be a huge demand for Indian rice , as India is in a sweet spot in terms of offering(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) competitive prices , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) Nitin Gupta , vice president of trader Olam India ’s rice business .
Since India has(#overlap 2020-04-03 14:19:42) vast surplus stocks , India could start(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) cashing(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) in on demand once labour shortages ease(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) , said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) REA ’s Rao .
India ’s rice exports in 2019 fell(#included 2019) 18.1 % from a year earlier to 9.87 million tonnes , the lowest in eight years , as demand moderated(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) from key Asian and African buyers .
India is likely to produce(#included 2019) 117.47 million tonnes of rice in 2019/20 against an annual consumption of about 100 million tonnes , with state inventories at 31 million tonnes .
If the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus is extended(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) , or the pandemic(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) spreads among key buying(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) nations , denting(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) demand , India ’s rice industry could suffer(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) major losses(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) , said(#before 2020-04-03 14:19:42) large exporter Vijay Sethia .
