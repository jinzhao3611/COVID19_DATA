The US ' epidemic curve started(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) off looking(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) similar to South Korea .
For the first month or so after South Korea 's first confirmed case , the number of infected people remained(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) low , with less than 15 cases .
Then , on February 28 — the day after the US first case of community spread — the number of cases started(#included 2020-01-20) to rise(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) each day , and rise has n't stopped(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) .

the US total number of confirmed(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) cases is likely far lower than the reality because South Korea is still ramping(#overlap 2020-03-18 00:56:10) up widespread testing(#overlap 2020-03-18 00:56:10) .
According to the COVID Tracking Project — a testing - tracking resource from two journalists at the Atlantic and the founder of a medical data startup — only 47,000 tests have been run(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) in the US so far .
( two journalists at the Atlantic and the founder of a medical data startup note(#overlap 2020-03-18 00:56:10) , however , that only 47,000 tests may be incomplete due to different state policies on reporting(#overlap 2020-03-18 00:56:10) negative tests.)South(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) South Korea , by contrast , can test(#after 2020-03-18 00:56:10) tens of thousands of people per day for COVID-19 .
As of Monday , South Korea had tested(#after 2020-03-18 00:56:10) 274,504 people .
tested allows(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) 274,504 people to quarantine(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) infected people more immediately .
South Korea robust testing(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) also likely means South Korea confirmed(#before 2020-03-18 00:56:10) case count is a ore accurate representation of the number of cases in South Korea than the US .
