The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has probed(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Altria ’s decision(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) to buy(#included December 2018) a 35 % stake in Juul , announced(#included December 2018) in December 2018 , for $ 12.8 billion .
The value of its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. has dwindled(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) to $ 4.2 billion , following(#included last year) a series of writedowns(#included last year) last year , as Juul faced(#included last year) litigation(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) and heightened(#included last year) regulatory scrutiny over its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. contribution to a surge(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) in teenage vaping(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) .
Altria and Juul were once competitors(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) in the e - cigarette market .
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleges(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) that once Juul skyrocketed(#included 2018) to become(#included 2018) e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. in 2018 , Altria dealt(#included 2018) with the competition by “ agreeing(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) not to compete(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) in return for a substantial ownership interest in Juul . ”
“ Altria and Juul turned(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) from competitors to collaborators by eliminating(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) competition and sharing(#included July 24 , 2019) in Juul profits , ” said(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Ian Conner , director of the The U.S. Federal Trade Commission ’s Bureau of Competition .
Juul did not respond(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) to a request(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) for comment(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) .
Altria said(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Altria planned(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) to “ vigorously defend(#before 2020-04-02) its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. . ”
“ Altria believe(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) that its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. does not harm(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) competition and that The U.S. Federal Trade Commission misunderstood(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) the facts , ” said(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Murray Garnick , Altria ’s executive vice president and general counsel .
Altria ’s MarkTen was at one point the second most popular e - cigarette maker , The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) .
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Altria responded(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) to Juul threat to its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. by agreeing(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) not to compete(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) in exchange for its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. .
Altria announced(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Altria would discontinue(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Altria MarkTen brand a few weeks before formally announcing(#included December 2018) its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. in December 2018 .
announced is the beginning(#included later this year) of what is likely to be a lengthy process and adds(#included the past year) to a relentless series of regulatory headaches for Juul over the past year .
Altria stopped(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) selling(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) popular flavors such as mango and mint in U.S. amid pressure(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) from regulators and lawmakers , and shed(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) hundreds of workers as Altria retooled(#included the past year) under new management .
Altria is facing(#included later this year) a critical regulatory deadline later this year to prove(#included later this year) that Altria products provide(#included later this year) a net benefit to public health , meaning(#included December 2018) Altria aid(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) smokers in quitting(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) more than smokers lure(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) teenagers or non - users into nicotine addiction .
Altria is Juul largest investor(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) , and a forced(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) divestiture would raise(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) substantial questions for Altria ’s future .
Although its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. has become(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) a disappointing one for Altria , Altria would be left(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) searching(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) for alternative products .
Altria initially believed(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) Juul could play(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) a major role in offsetting(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) declining(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) cigarette sales(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) .
In January , Altria projected(#included January) U.S. cigarette sales(#included this year) would decline(#included this year) 4 % to 6 % this year .
Altria said(#included late March) in late March that Chief Executive Officer Howard Willard has contracted(#included late March) its investment in e - cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. FILE PHOTO and is taking(#included late March) temporary medical leave .
Chief Financial Officer William Gifford Jr is taking(#after 2020-04-02 01:45:19) over in Chief Financial Officer William Gifford Jr absence(#overlap 2020-04-02 01:45:19) , Altria disclosed(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday .
In October , Altria had acknowledged(#included October) that U.S. antitrust enforcers were also looking(#included late March) into allegations that Altria had potentially exerted(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) influence over Juul before winning(#included October) approval for sell .
Prior to antitrust approval(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) , it is illegal(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) for companies involved(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) in mergers or similar transactions(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) to coordinate(#before 2020-04-02 01:45:19) in many areas .
