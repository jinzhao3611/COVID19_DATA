More than 2,000 ventilators , a key piece of equipment to treat(#overlap 2020-04-02 13:33:56) coronavirus patients , in federal stockpile are unavailable(#overlap 2020-04-02 13:33:56) to be deployed(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) because the Trump administration failed(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) to maintain(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) the devices as the devices were in storage , according to The New York Times .
Trump said(#included Tuesday) Tuesday that the federal government is withholding(#overlap 2020-04-02 13:33:56) 10,000 ventilators from distribution(#after 2020-04-02 13:33:56) because of an anticipated surge(#included Tuesday) in Covid-19 cases .
But an additional 2,109 ventilators are out of commission(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) because maintenance(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) of the devices was halted(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) during a contracting dispute , The New York Times reported(#included Wednesday) Tuesday .
States are scrambling(#overlap 2020-04-02 13:33:56) for ventilators and requesting(#overlap 2020-04-02 13:33:56) thousands of the devices from the federal government , only to receive(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) a few hundred .
Trump has insisted(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) that states are requesting(#overlap 2020-04-02 13:33:56) more ventilators than states need(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) .
When the federal government contract with Vyaire Medical to maintain(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) some of the stockpile ventilators expired(#included the end of August) at the end of August , the federal government awarded(#included the end of August) a broader contract to Vyaire Medical , according to The New York Times .

Experts say(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) ventilators can not be stored(#before 2020-04-02 13:33:56) for long periods without upkeep , The New York Times noted(#included Saturday) .
