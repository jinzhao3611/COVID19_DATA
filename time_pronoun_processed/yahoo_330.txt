SINGAPORE — It is important for Singapore to have(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) a “ boring and consistent ” approach to foreign policy based(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) on principles , said(#included Sunday) Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrisnan on Monday ( 2 March ) .
Vivian Balakrishnan was responding(#included Sunday) during the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ’ ( MFA ) Committee of Supply debate(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) to a question by Member of Parliament ( MP ) Vikram Nair on whether any bilateral projects with Malaysia would be affected(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) by the recent change in administration in Putrajaya .
The Malaysian King on Sunday swore(#included Sunday) in Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister following(#included Sunday) a week of political turmoil(#included 24 February) in Malaysia which saw(#included 24 February) Dr Mahathir Mohamad resigning(#included 2 March) as premier on 24 February .
Singapore ’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong congratulated(#included Sunday) Singapore ’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong new Malaysian counterpart on Sunday , adding(#included Sunday) that Singapore ’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong was confident the Republic ’s long - standing relationship with Malaysia would grow(#after 2020-03-02 11:54:15) under Muhyiddin Yassin ’s leadership .
Singapore ’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong also invited(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) Muhyiddin Yassin to visit(#included recent) Singapore soon , saying(#included Sunday) that they had(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) much to discuss(#after 2020-03-02 11:54:15) .
Member of Parliament ( MP ) Vikram Nair , was seeking(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) clarification about the impact(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) on bilateral ties following(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) the latest political developments(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) .
Member of Parliament ( MP ) Vikram Nair asked(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) , “ Because typically when an administration changes or notwithstanding an administration may have(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) good relationships with us , an administration may have(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) different priorities from the previous administration , and are there any projects that us think(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) may slow(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) down as a result of that ... what could us do about that ? ”
In reply(#included Sunday) , Vivian Balakrishnan said(#included Sunday) that as the Cabinet in Malaysia has not been announced(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) , Vivian Balakrishnan did not want(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) to “ prejudge(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) the issue ” .
“ But Vivian Balakrishnan will just make(#after 2020-03-02 11:54:15) two points that we know(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) all the people on the political scene in Malaysia .
And in fact we 've taken(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) extra effort to maintain(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) those links , and to build(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) that reservoir of goodwill and trust , so let we keep(#overlap 2020-03-02 11:54:15) an open mind , ” Vivian Balakrishnan said(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) .
“ The second point Vivian Balakrishnan want(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) to make(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) is the importance of consistency and a principled foreign policy .
So Vivian Balakrishnan hope(#overlap 2020-03-02 11:54:15) this is a moment where Singaporeans will appreciate(#included recent) it 's good to be boring and consistent , ” Vivian Balakrishnan added(#included Sunday) .
Earlier , Vivian Balakrishnan said(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) that Singapore was looking(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) forward to resuming(#after 2020-03-02 11:54:15) talks(#after 2020-03-02 11:54:15) with the new Malaysian government on the delayed(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) Singapore - Kuala Lumpur High Speed Rail ( HSR ) and the Johor Baru Rapid Transit System ( RTS ) projects .
Vivian Balakrishnan noted(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) that after the Pakatan Harapan government took(#included May 2018) office in May 2018 , the projects were delayed(#included May 2018) .
“ When delayed happened(#included Monday () , Singapore could have enforced(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) our legal rights , and our could have sought(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) full compensation from Malaysia .
But in the spirit of constructive bilateral cooperation(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) at Malaysia request(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) , our agreed(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) to temporarily suspend(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) the projects through formal agreements(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) . ”
Vivian Balakrishnan said(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) that Singapore gave(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) Malaysia some time to review(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) Malaysia position and to propose(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) amendments to what had been previously agreed(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) to contractually .
“ However , these major infrastructural projects can not be suspended(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) indefinitely .
At some point , our do need(#overlap 2020-03-02 11:54:15) to decide(#overlap 2020-03-02 11:54:15) whether to proceed(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) or not . ”
On maritime boundary delimitation , Vivian Balakrishnan said(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) the two countries have held(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) constructive talks on maritime boundary delimitation and are cooperating(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) in other areas such as the development of Iskandar Malaysia and joint efforts by the health authorities from the two countries to fight(#overlap 2020-03-02 11:54:15) the COVID-19 outbreak(#before 2020-03-02 11:54:15) .
