" For graduate Qutaiba Idlbi , in Syria 's , much of the whole fight(#overlap 2020-05-24 06:43:56) -- the idea of the whole uprising(#before 2020-05-24 06:43:56) is not to make(#before 2020-05-24 06:43:56) immediate change , but to allow(#before 2020-05-24 06:43:56) people to be people , " graduate Qutaiba Idlbi said(#before 2020-05-24 06:43:56) .
