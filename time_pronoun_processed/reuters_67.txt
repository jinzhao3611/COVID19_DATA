NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices steadied(#included 2020-03-31) on Tuesday , with the U.S. crude benchmark climbing(#included 2020-03-31) off 18 - year lows after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) to talks(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) on stabilising(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) energy markets .

However , gains(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) were capped(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) as global demand continues(#overlap 2020-03-31 16:09:07) to be slammed(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) by travel restrictions(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) due to the coronavirus pandemic .
May Brent crude futures was 4 cents lower at $ 22.72 a barrel by 11:05 a.m. ET ( 1505 GMT ) after closing(#included Monday) on Monday at $ 22.76 , May Brent crude futures lowest finish since November 2002 .
May Brent crude futures hit(#included November 22) a session high of $ 23.87 .
The more - active June contract traded(#included June) 18 cents lower at $ 26.24 a barrel .
U.S. crude was up 55 cents at $ 20.64 after settling(#included November 22) in the previous session at $ 20.09 , U.S. crude lowest since February 2002 .
U.S. crude traded(#included 2020-04) as high as $ 21.89 a barrel earlier in the previous session .
Oil markets have faced(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) a double whammy from the coronavirus pandemic and a race to win(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) market share between Saudi Arabia and Russia after OPEC and other producers failed(#included 2020-04) this month to agree(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) on deeper supply cuts to support(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) oil prices .
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) in a phone call(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) to have(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin top energy officials discuss(#included May) stabilising(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) oil markets , the Kremlin said(#included 2020-03-31) on Monday .
Although the futures market is seeing(#overlap 2020-03-31 16:09:07) a recovery , physical cargoes are selling(#overlap 2020-03-31 16:09:07) in some regions at single digits , with sellers offering(#overlap 2020-03-31 16:09:07) hefty discounts .
With a plunge(#included June) in prices that has knocked(#included 2020-04) about 60 % off oil prices this year , a commissioner with the Texas state energy regulator renewed(#included 2020-04) a call for restrictions(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) on crude production(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) because of a national supply glut .
However , U.S. crude producers are likely facing(#included Monday) cuts(#included Monday) in April anyway as there are no buyers in physical markets for crude in the Permian , the biggest shale basin the country , or the U.S. Gulf Coast , said(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) Scott Shelton , energy specialist at United ICAP .
“ It ’s just a matter of time before we see(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) U.S. crude producers be forced(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) by the crude gatherers to cut(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) as one can not ‘ gather(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) ’ crude when there are no buyers or tanks to store(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) ’ crude in , ” Scott Shelton , energy specialist at United ICAP said(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) .
In a sign of how well the futures market is supplied(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) , the front - month Brent futures contract for May is trading(#included November) at a discount of $ 13.95 a barrel to the November contract , the widest contango spread ever seen(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) , ahead of the May contract ’s expiry(#included November) .
A contango market implies(#overlap 2020-03-31 16:09:07) traders expect(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) oil to be higher in the future , encouraging(#overlap 2020-03-31 16:09:07) traders to store(#included May) oil now to sell(#included April) later .
Saudi Arabia , de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , plans(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) to boost(#after 2020-03-31 16:09:07) Saudi Arabia , de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , oil exports to 10.6 million barrels per day ( bpd ) from May on lower domestic consumption , a Saudi Energy Ministry official said(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) .
Global oil refiners , meanwhile , have cut(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) Global oil refiners throughput because of the slump in demand for transportation fuel , with European refineries reducing(#included 2020-03-31) output by at least 1.3 million bpd , sources told(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) Reuters .
Exxon Mobil Corp closed(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) a small crude distillation unit at Exxon Mobil Corp 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana because of low demand , sources said(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) .
The chief economist for global commodities trader Trafigura said(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) that oil demand could fall(#included April) in the coming(#included May) weeks by as much as 30 % from consumption at the end of last year .
A Reuters survey of 40 analysts forecast(#before 2020-03-31 16:09:07) Brent crude prices would average(#included the coming weeks) $ 38.76 a barrel in 2020 , 36 % lower than the $ 60.63 forecast(#included the coming weeks) in a February 2002 survey(#included May) .
