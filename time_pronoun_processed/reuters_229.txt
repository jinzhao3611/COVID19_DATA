“ With markets closed(#before 2020-03-17 07:13:11) , it would be puzzling(#before 2020-03-17 07:13:11) how additional government bonds would be issued(#before 2020-03-17 07:13:11) and received(#after 2020-03-17 07:13:11) by markets , ” said(#before 2020-03-17 07:13:11) Ken Peng , head of Asia investment strategy at Citi Private Bank .
