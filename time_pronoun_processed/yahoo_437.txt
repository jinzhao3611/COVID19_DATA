2020-05-29 19:37:54 +00:00 .
European equities should see(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) a green stretch ahead thanks to the new stimulus(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) and reopening(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) of economies .
The European Commission recently unveiled(#included recently) a plan to borrow(#included recently) 750 billion euros ( $ 826.5 billion ) on the market and then disburse(#included recently) to EU countries , which will include(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) 500 billion euros in grants and 250 billion euros in loans .
unveiled will help(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) EU countries recover(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) from the coronavirus slump .
Out of the 500 billion euros in loans , 310 billion will be deployed(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) in green and digital transitions .
The initiative(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) has been viewed(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) as incredible as Germany “ had always opposed(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) the idea of jointly - issued debt , even during previous crises , ” per CNBC .
Austria , the Netherlands , Sweden and Denmark , however , are against the concept of grant .
Instead , Austria , the Netherlands , Sweden and Denmark support(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) the loan format and seek(#overlap 2020-05-29 19:37:54) economic reform commitments(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) in response to any financial aid , CNBC noted(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) .
The allocation(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) of these funds will be done via the European budget , which is a common basket that receives aids from all 27 member countries and finances various projects across the Eurozone .
Investors should expect(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) a strict negotiation(#included the coming days) among countries in the coming days .
In order to finance(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) some of the incremental costs , The European Commission proposed(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) implementing(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) a carbon border duty , a tax on plastics , a common consolidated(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) corporate tax base and a digital tax .
The European Commission also proposed(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) that the European budget , which is a common basket that receives aids from all 27 member countries and finances various projects across the Eurozone should receive(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) a bigger share of the Value Added Tax paid(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) by governments to The European Commission .
Investors should note(#overlap 2020-05-29 19:37:54) that apart from the latest stimulus(#included November 2019) plan , The European Commission launched(#included March) an $ 820 billion coronavirus package in March .
Apart from this , The European Commission restarted(#included November 2019) QE from November 2019 and has(#overlap 2020-05-29 19:37:54) a negative interest in place ( read(#before 2020-05-29 19:37:54) : ETFs to Gain(#after 2020-05-29 19:37:54) on The European Commission Coronavirus Emergency Stimulus Rollout ) .
