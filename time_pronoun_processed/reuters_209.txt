“ An exception is unthinkable , it is clear that the lockdown(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) applies(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) to all , athletes included(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) , ” French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu said(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) .
riders in France and Spain , where many are based are resigned(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) to a bit of down time .
“ For the moment French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu ’m not training(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) , French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu ’m taking(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) a one - week break , ” Trek - Segafredo ’s Julien Bernard told(#included 2020-04-01) Reuters on Wednesday .
“ We do n’t know(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) when racing will resume(#included the end of May) , at best at the end of May , ” French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu added(#included 2020-04-01) .
The International Cycling Union ( UCI ) on Wednesday said(#included 2020-04-01) once the season resumes(#included June 27) The International Cycling Union ( UCI ) will give(#included 2020-04-01) priority to “ events on the calendar at the date of resumption(#included June 27) ” and to the five Monuments ( Milan - Sanremo , Tour of Flanders , Paris - Roubaix , Liege - Bastogne - Liege and Tour of Flanders ) and three Grands Tours ( Italy , France and Spain ) .
The Monuments , with the exception of Tour of Flanders , have been postponed(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) , as well as the Giro d’Italia , which was scheduled(#included the end of May) from May 9 - 31 .
Tour of Flanders organisers have not yet considered(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) postponing(#included June 27) the June 27 - July 19 event , which is due to finish five days before the start of the Tokyo Olympics .
Julien Bernard believes(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) arrangements will be made(#after 2020-03-18 19:41:19) for athletes in France .
“ For now the June 27 - July 19 event , which is due to finish five days before the start of the Tokyo Olympics ’s only two weeks then authorities will probably take(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) measures for professional athletes , so there ’s no panic(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) , ” Julien Bernard said(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) .
French authorities imposed(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) a two - week lockdown , however , making(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) clear a two - week lockdown would likely be extended(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) .
In Italy , where similar measures have been taken(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) , riders can still go(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) out to train(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) , but Under-23 world champion Samuele Battistella said(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) Under-23 world champion Samuele Battistella suffered(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) a barrage of insults on social media for riding(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) Under-23 world champion Samuele Battistella bike in the centre of Bassano del Grappa in the Province of Vincenza .
“ Under-23 world champion Samuele Battistella ca n’t ride(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) with a banner on Under-23 world champion Samuele Battistella back saying(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) ‘ Under-23 world champion Samuele Battistella am working(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) ’ , ” the rider from the Veneto region told(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) La Gazzetta dello Sport .
The Italian federation on Wednesday urged(#included 2020-04-01) the professional riders to stay(#included 2020-04-01) at home .
“ Each of us must sacrifice(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) something that belongs(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) to us , us must give(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) up cycling(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) in the open air , on the roads of Italy , ” said(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) president Renato Di Rocco .
Swiss rider Sebastien Reichenbach believes(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) it is wiser to stay(#overlap 2020-03-18 19:41:19) at home .
“ Swiss rider Sebastien Reichenbach would have(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) a bad conscience if Swiss rider Sebastien Reichenbach crashed(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) and were to occupy(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) a hospital bed , ” the rider from the Veneto region told(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) Swiss newspaper Le Nouvelliste .
“ So Swiss rider Sebastien Reichenbach ride(#after 2020-03-18 19:41:19) on Swiss rider Sebastien Reichenbach home trainer and do other physical activities .
To be honest Swiss rider Sebastien Reichenbach do n’t think(#Depend-on 2020-03-18 19:41:19) about the current season anymore . ”
That approach(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) has been followed(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) by the rider from the Veneto region team mate and Tour of Flanders podium finisher(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) Thibaut Pinot of France , who has been posting(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) pictures of his fishing catches(#before 2020-03-18 19:41:19) on social media .
