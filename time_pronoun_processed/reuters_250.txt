BEIRUT , March 13 ( Reuters ) -
With distressed(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) debt investors and emerging markets funds suddenly faced(#included March 13) with one of the sharpest asset price falls(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) in a generation , Lebanon picked(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) the wrong time to go(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) bankrupt .
Funds are still circling(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) as the clock ticks(#included March 13) down on Lebanon ’s first sovereign default , but some may not buy(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) until after Lebanon unveils(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) plans to revamp(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) the debt and reform(#after 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Lebanon economy , and the dust settles(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) on a global asset plunge(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) .
More than $ 450 million of the debt has been traded(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) since Lebanon said(#included the weekend) at the weekend Lebanon could not meet(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Lebanon foreign currency debt , MarketAxess data showed(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) .
Lebanon is on a path to default(#included Monday) when the grace period for Lebanon $ 1.2 billion Eurobond expires(#included Monday) on Monday .
Hedge funds and distressed(#included March 13) debt funds were among the buyers the weekend , two financial sources familiar with the matter said(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) .
Their purchases add(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) a risk of uncertainty to Lebanon ’s debt restructuring process , given(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) the record of some in that industry pursuing(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) legal action in other countries in dire straits , such as Argentina and Venezuela .
But Lebanon ’s debt restructuring process could also potentially help(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) smooth Lebanon ’s debt restructuring process along if Their purchases are motivated(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) to secure(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) a consensual restructuring(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) deal , said(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) one of two financial sources familiar with the matter .
Some funds and existing holders of the debt say(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Some funds and existing holders of the debt ’re waiting(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) for information on the likely scale of the haircut on the debt and concrete plans on areas like rescuing(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) the banking sector and reforming(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) the energy and telecom sectors .
“ There ’s been a default and bonds are a lot cheaper but there ’s still a lot of uncertainty as we still need(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) to know(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) what they will do with the banking sector , depositor haircuts and currency , ” said(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Richard House , CIO emerging market debt , Allianz Global Investors , which is considering buying .
Other investors are steering(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) clear for now , as long as there is so much global uncertainty following(#included the weekend) the weekend ’s coronavirus - inspired oil price war(#included this week) and asset price falls(#included the weekend) .
“ We are looking(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) at it but not involved(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) , ” said(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Alberto Gallo , head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments , a London - based hedge fund that exited(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) positions in Lebanon and Argentina before both got(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) into distress(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) .
“ At 25 cents in normal circumstances We would buy(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) it as We like(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Lebanon , but in the current market there are a lot of other credits that have come(#included current) down in price .
What will make(#after 2020-03-13 11:44:10) We more positive is if there ’s a clear plan and if the oil price war(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) calms(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) down a bit . ”
Finance minister Ghazi Wazni said(#included Thursday) on Thursday that Lebanon ’s plan to tackle(#after 2020-03-13 11:44:10) Lebanon crisis(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) will meet(#after 2020-03-13 11:44:10) IMF recommendations(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) and will be ready to be presented(#included currently) to creditors in weeks .
More of the debt could change(#included the coming weeks) hands in the coming(#included the coming weeks) weeks once holders decide(#included currently) whether to crystallise(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) losses(#included March 2020) from the default or ride(#after 2020-03-13 11:44:10) the default out to see(#included currently) if recovery values improve(#after 2020-03-13 11:44:10) .
The dollar bonds(#included currently) are currently trading(#included currently) generally below 25 cents to the dollar , with the March 2020 issue having shed(#included the coming weeks) more than half the March 2020 issue value in the past week .
A total of $ 239.6 million of the debt was traded(#included Monday) on Monday , according to MarketAxess data , the highest in several weeks , but still short of levels reached(#included the past week) earlier this year when local banks , which hold the largest chunk of the debt , sold(#included this week) some of local banks , which hold the largest chunk of the debt , holdings to foreign funds .
Distressed debt veterans Greylock Capital and Switzerland - base Mangart Advisors have begun(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) organising(#overlap 2020-03-13 11:44:10) talks(#before 2020-03-13 11:44:10) between some bond holders and other interested investors .
