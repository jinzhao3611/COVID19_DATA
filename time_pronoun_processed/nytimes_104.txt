2020-04-16 09:02:32 +00:00 .
Trump was certainly not the only official who was slow to adapt(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) .
Human beings are hard - wired to follow(#overlap 2020-04-16 09:02:32) the herd .
On March 2 Bill de Blasio , the mayor of New York City , was still encouraging(#included March 2) New Yorkers to “ get(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) out on New York City despite the coronavirus . ”
Bill de Blasio , the mayor of New York City , went(#included March 16) to the gym in Brooklyn on March 16 , even after he ’d announced(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) the city schools were shutting(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) down .
( Then again , Trump , on March 2 , said(#included March 2) Trump expected(#included March 2) deaths(#included March 2) to be in a “ much smaller range ” than those from the flu .
On March 10 , Trump still said(#included March 10) : “ Just stay(#included right now) calm .
It will go(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) away . ” )
Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now , admitted(#included recently) recently that Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now rode(#included recently) the subway to work(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) in the early days of the flu .
“ When the White House heard(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) rode , the White House went(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) completely nuts , ” Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now said(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) .
“ If some people are riding(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) the subway , how bad could riding be ? ”
Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now said(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) when Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now asked(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now about this phenomenon — what psychologists call(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) “ normative influence . ”
No one wants(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) to be a chump .
“ Human beings look(#overlap 2020-04-16 09:02:32) to other human beings to know(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) what to do , ” Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now said(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) .
“ It ’s the primary way we know(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) what to do . ”
Which makes(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) the early action of some of our governors all the more remarkable — particularly Mike DeWine of Ohio .
On March 3 , the day after Bill de Blasio , the mayor of New York City , was encouraging(#included March 3) New Yorkers to mingle(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) , Mike DeWine of Ohio was canceling(#included March 3) the Arnold Classic , a health - and - fitness Lollapalooza that draws some 60,000 participants from 80 countries .
( the Arnold Classic , a health - and - fitness Lollapalooza that draws some 60,000 participants from 80 countries was named(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) after Arnold Schwarzenegger , natch . )
Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now spoke(#included last week) to Mike DeWine of Ohio last week to try(#included last week) to determine(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) what , precisely , gave(#included last week) Mike DeWine of Ohio the fortitude to cancel(#included last week) the Arnold Classic , a health - and - fitness Lollapalooza that draws some 60,000 participants from 80 countries .
Mike DeWine of Ohio was three days ahead of the city officials in Austin , Tex . , who canceled(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) South by Southwest , and at the time even that was considered(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) extreme .
Mike DeWine of Ohio canceled(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) school before any governor in America .
Mike DeWine of Ohio shut(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) down restaurants and bars long before New York City .
And New York City had(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) far fewer cases of Covid-19 than New York City .
And Mike DeWine of Ohio ’s a Republican .
Red - state governors have been far more reluctant(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) to issue(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) stay - at - home orders(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) during the flu than blue - state governors .
To this day , Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota still has n’t issued(#overlap 2020-04-16 09:02:32) one , though more than 300 workers in a pork - processing factory in her state fell(#included Sunday) ill , forcing(#included Sunday) a pork - processing factory in her state to shut(#included Sunday) down on Sunday .
“ he ’d spent(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) over 40 years in public office , ” Mike DeWine of Ohio told(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now .
“ When he ’d made(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) mistakes , it ’s usually because Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now did n’t have(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) enough information .
Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now did n’t ask(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) enough questions , Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now did n’t ask(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) the right people , Even Dr. Anthony Fauci , perhaps the most trusted man in America right now did n’t drill(#before 2020-04-16 09:02:32) down deep enough into the facts .
That experience was helpful in regard to this . ”
