Erin Scott Musk , who has often made(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) outspoken and even inflammatory comments on conference(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) calls(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) and on Facebook , said(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) in comments(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) to analysts on Tesla Inc ’s ( TSLA.O ) earnings call that it was “ fascist ” to say(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) people can not leave(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) people homes .
“ This is not democratic , This is not freedom .
Give(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) people back people goddamn freedom , ” Musk said(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) .
Mark Zuckerberg , on the other hand , in comments(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) on Facebook ’s ( FB.O ) own earnings calls(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) , expressed(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) concerns about easing(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) lockdown(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) measure and said(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) the economic fallout from the pandemic would last(#after 2020-04-30 02:18:50) longer than people are currently anticipating(#included currently) .
“ Mark Zuckerberg worry(#overlap 2020-04-30 02:18:50) that reopening(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) to very minimal levels will almost guarantee(#after 2020-04-30 02:18:50) future outbreaks(#after 2020-04-30 02:18:50) and worse longer - term health and economic outcomes , ” Mark Zuckerberg said(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) .
Silicon Valley billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are based(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) in the San Francisco Bay area , which was out front in trying to slow the virus ’ spread , with the San Francisco Bay area , which was out front in trying to slow the virus ’ spread ’s seven counties issuing(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) a joint shelter - in - place order before California issued(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) a statewide order .
Tesla and Facebook have had(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) different experiences under a joint shelter - in - place order .
Tesla had initially resisted(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) efforts by California authorities to shut(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) Tesla plant in San Francisco Bay under a joint shelter - in - place order , until agreeing(#included March 19) on March 19 to suspend(#included March 19) production(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) .

Facebook on Wednesday said(#included Wednesday) usage rose(#included the first quarter) during the first quarter amid the widespread lockdowns , although ad revenue plunged(#included 2020-03) in March .
Musk did not mince(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) words in criticizing(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) the widespread lockdowns .
“ So the extension of the shelter - in - place or , frankly , Musk would call(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) the extension of the shelter - in - place , forcibly imprisoning(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) people in people homes against all people constitutional rights , in Musk opinion , breaking(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) people ’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) to America or built(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) America , ” Musk said , swearing to underscore Musk point .
“ It will cause(#after 2020-04-30 02:18:50) great harm , not just to Tesla , but to any companies .
And while Tesla will weather(#after 2020-04-30 02:18:50) the pandemic , there are many small companies that will not , ” Musk said(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) .
Zuckerberg and Musk , who is also chief executive of rocket company SpaceX , have had(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) differences in the past .
In 2017 , a war(#included 2017) of words broke(#included 2017) out between Zuckerberg and Musk , who is also chief executive of rocket company SpaceX , over whether robots will become(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) smart enough to kill(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) Zuckerberg and Musk , who is also chief executive of rocket company SpaceX , human creators .
“ Facebook ’s Zuckerberg talked(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) to Mark Zuckerberg about this .
Mark Zuckerberg understanding of the subject is limited(#overlap 2020-04-30 02:18:50) . ”
Musk tweeted(#before 2020-04-30 02:18:50) at the time about Mark Zuckerberg .
