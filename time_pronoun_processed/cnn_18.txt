" The Scheme " takes(#before 2020-03-30 16:51:33) about 25 minutes -- most of " The Scheme " devoted(#before 2020-03-30 16:51:33) to Dawkins -- currently appealing his conviction for bribery- - biography and early life -- before the narrative really kicks(#before 2020-03-30 16:51:33) into gear , but after that , " The Scheme " 's a riveting , meticulously detailed guide to a system that seemingly invites(#overlap 2020-03-30 16:51:33) rule breaking at every turn .

The other one is in last place . "
More than anything , at this particular moment " The Scheme " feels(#included March 31) like an exercise in cognitive dissonance -- demonstrating(#included March 31) that it 's possible to miss(#before 2020-03-30 16:51:33) college basketball and still be clear eyed about college basketball abundant flaws .
