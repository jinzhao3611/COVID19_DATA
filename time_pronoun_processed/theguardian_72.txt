China was widely criticised(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) over attempts(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) to cover(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) up the outbreak(#included the early weeks) in the early weeks , including(#included the early weeks) crackdowns(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) on doctors who tried(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) to warn(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) colleagues about a new Sars - like virus which was emerging(#included the early weeks) in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province .
The data obtained(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) by the South China Morning Post , which the Guardian has not been able to verify(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) , said(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) a 55 - year - old from Hubei province could have been the first person to contract(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) Covid-19 .

Of those who have contracted(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) the virus since the virus began(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) , 68,324 people have recovered(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) .
Almost 81,000 of the cases occurred(#included the early weeks) in China , mostly in Hubei province .
Official statements(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) by China to the World Health Organisation reported(#included 8 December) that The first case of someone suffering from Covid-19 had been diagnosed(#included 8 December) on 8 December .
Doctors who tried(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) to raise(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) the alarm with colleagues about a new disease in late December were reprimanded(#included 8 December) .
Authorities did not publicly concede(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) there was human - to - human transmission until 21 January .
Jonathan Mayer , professor emeritus at the University of Washington ’s department of epidemiology , said(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) it was “ entirely conceivable ” there were cases as early as mid - November .
Jonathan Mayer , professor emeritus at the University of Washington ’s department of epidemiology , said(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) there were three possibilities : that cases were n’t detected(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) at the time , that cases were detected(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) but not recognised(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) as a new disease , or cases were detected(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) and recognised(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) but reporting(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) was suppressed(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) .
“ Jonathan Mayer , professor emeritus at the University of Washington ’s department of epidemiology , have(#overlap 2020-03-13 06:45:27) no way of knowing(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) which of three possibilities in fact happened(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) , ” Jonathan Mayer , professor emeritus at the University of Washington ’s department of epidemiology , told(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) the Guardian .
“ We know(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) that there are reports(#overlap 2020-03-13 06:45:27) of early suppression of reports(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) of cases , and the ‘ whistleblowers ’ dealt(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) with rather severely .
But in fairness , the signs and symptoms of Covid-19 are non - specific and even now , without confirmatory testing(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) , it is easy to mistake(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) this for another disease . ”
Jonathan Mayer , professor emeritus at the University of Washington ’s department of epidemiology , said(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) it was highly improbably that patient zero would ever be identified(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) .
The origins of the virus have become(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) part of US - China diplomatic conflict(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) , fuelled(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) by US officials calling(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) the virus “ Chinese coronavirus ” or “ Wuhan virus ” .
It ’s widely accepted(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) , including(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) by the head of China ’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention that the virus originated(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) in Hubei province .
However in recent ​weeks Chinese officials have started(#included recent ​weeks) suggesting(#included recent ​weeks) or outright claiming(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) that the virus not ​originate​(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) in China , but perhaps in the US​ , a conspiracy theory that is gaining(#included now) traction​. On Thursday , Zhao Lijian , a foreign ministry spokesman , suggested(#included Thursday) without evidence that the US army may have brought(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) the virus into China .
“ Epidemics always have become(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) political , ” said(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) Jonathan Mayer , professor emeritus at the University of Washington ’s department of epidemiology , .
“ Governments seem(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) opposed(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) to admitting(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) that things were handled(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) imperfectly , yet it is only by identifying(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) the imperfections and shortcomings that things can be addressed(#after 2020-03-13 06:45:27) to do a better job next time .
With emerging(#before 2020-03-13 06:45:27) infections , there will always be a next time . ”
