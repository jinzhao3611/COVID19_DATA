SAO PAULO ( Reuters ) - China ’s beef imports will fall(#included the first half of 2020) in the first half of 2020 due to fallout from the coronavirus outbreak , which is complicating the circulation of people and trade globally , Rabobank said(#included 2020-04-02) in a report released on Thursday .

The situation may rein(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) in Brazil ’s meat export bonanza , as domestic food processors were among the biggest winners of additional Chinese food import demand after African swine fever has disrupted(#after around August 2018) local meat suppliers since around August 2018 .
Rabobank said(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) China ’s high inventory of frozen beef stored(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) in local markets in preparation(#included January) for the country ’s Lunar New Year holiday was not used(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) in January due to the coronavirus outbreak , which is complicating the circulation of people and trade globally .
Some could remain(#before March) closed(#before March) until March as people continue(#before March) to avoid(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) eating(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) out , Rabobank said(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) .
“ Quick service restaurants may be impacted(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) the least , while hotpot and full - service restaurants will see(#included the first quarter) sales(#included the first quarter) decline(#included the first quarter) markedly in the first quarter , ” a report released on Thursday said(#included 2020-04-02) .
Citing(#included January) uncertainties around to what degree coronavirus can be contained(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) in the first quarter , Rabobank mentioned(#included January) the possibility that the food service and tourism industries would remain(#included the first half of 2020) disrupted(#included April) through April or May.
“ This lower sales volume means beef demand will be weaker than normal years in the first half , ” Rabobank said(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) .
Brazil ’s total beef exports hit(#included the first half of 2020) a record $ 7.5 billion in 2019 driven(#included the first half of 2020) by strong demand from China , which accounted(#included the first half of 2020) 26.6 % of the volume exported(#included the first half of 2020) by domestic beef packers , according to data compiled(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) by meat association Abrafrigo .
If sales(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) to Hong Kong are included(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) , the combined volume rises(#included January) to 45 % .
Some of Brazil ’s main beef exporters include(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) Minerva , JBS and Marfrig .
Still , after a 2019 marked(#included April) by record exports and prices , the Brazilian beef industry “ is experiencing(#included 2019) a moment of rebalancing(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) of supply and demand , ” Rabobank said(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) .
Brazil registered(#included the first half of 2020) unprecedented price levels late last year due to strong beef exports , making(#included 2020-04-02) the domestic market retract(#included January) when the price increases(#included 2020-04-02) reached(#included 2020-04-02) the local consumer .
Meanwhile the rainy season generated(#included the first quarter) pasture growth(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) , which lowers(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) production(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) costs but limits(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) the supply of animals sent(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) for slaughter(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) , Rabobank noted(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) .
“ With [ Brazil ’s ] domestic consumption still considered(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) weak and China reducing(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) purchases(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) due to the coronavirus , abattoirs are unwilling to pay(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) higher prices to attract(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) increased(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) volumes , ” Rabobank said(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) .
Although still 27 % higher than in 2019 , Brazilian cattle prices in January dropped(#included April) 9.8 % from 211.97 reais per 15 kilograms in December , Rabobank data showed(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) .
Aside from rise(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) in the cost to buy(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) cattle , rising(#before 2020-02-27 19:50:08) animal feed costs constitute(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) another challenge(#overlap 2020-02-27 19:50:08) for Brazilian beef - packers , Rabobank noted(#included 2020-04-02) .
