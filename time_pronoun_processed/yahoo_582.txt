As states around the country move(#overlap 2020-05-06 12:25:19) toward opening(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) businesses and easing(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) restrictions(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) on mobility , Trump Tuesday dismissed(#included Tuesday) concerns(#included Tuesday) that the number of deaths from the coronavirus could nearly double(#after 2020-05-06 12:25:19) in the next three months .
“ We did everything right , but now it ’s time to go(#included PRESENT_REF) back to work(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) , ” Trump said(#included Tuesday) as Trump took(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) questions before departing(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) the White House for a trip(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) to Arizona .
Reporters asked(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) if Trump was concerned(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) about models showing(#included August) 134,000 deaths(#included August) by August .
the number of deaths from the coronavirus was included(#included Tuesday) in a projection(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
A separate projection by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Seattle Monday arrived(#included Monday) at almost the same figure , 135,000 , the midpoint of a range of 95,092 to 242,890 .
“ almost the same figure , 135,000 , the midpoint of a range of 95,092 to 242,890 assumes(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) no mitigation(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) , and we ’re going(#after 2020-05-06 12:25:19) to have(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) mitigation , ” said(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) Trump .
But the IHME model “ assumes(#overlap 2020-05-06 12:25:19) that mandates that are currently in place will stay(#included PRESENT_REF) in place until infections are minimized(#after 2020-05-06 12:25:19) , ” according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Seattle Monday .
A separate projection by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Seattle Monday , representing(#included late March) a large increase(#included late March) from late March , “ reflects(#included late March) rising(#included currently) mobility in most U.S. states as well as the easing of social distancing measures(#included PRESENT_REF) expected(#included April 12) in 31 states by May 11 , indicating(#included late March) that growing(#overlap 2020-05-06 12:25:19) contacts among people will promote(#after 2020-05-06 12:25:19) transmission of the coronavirus . ”
Trump has encouraged(#after late March) the trend toward easing(#after late March) restrictions(#after late March) since late March when Trump originally set(#included May 11) a goal of April 12 for returning(#included PRESENT_REF) to normality , before reversing(#included April 12) Trump after experts warned(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) of a catastrophic resurgence(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) of COVID-19 cases .
While protests(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) calling(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) for restrictions to be lifted have garnered(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) headlines and viral social media posts , polling shows(#overlap 2020-05-06 12:25:19) a majority of Americans are still supportive of restrictions to be lifted .
“ We ’re doing mitigation(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) ... but we have to get(#overlap 2020-05-06 12:25:19) the country open .
we have to open(#before 2020-05-06 12:25:19) the country , ” Trump said(#included Tuesday) Tuesday .
