Federal officials acknowledge(#before 2020-05-19 03:43:22) some victims have died(#before 2020-05-19 03:43:22) without being tested(#before 2020-05-19 03:43:22) and have pledged(#before 2020-05-19 03:43:22) that cases where death certificates mention coronavirus as a possible or probable cause of death would eventually be added(#after 2020-05-19 03:43:22) to official death(#before 2020-05-19 03:43:22) tolls .
