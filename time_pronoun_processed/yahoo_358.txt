( Bloomberg ) -- Wall Street ’s favorite whipping - boys want(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) you to know(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) : They ’re not responsible for Monday ’s bloodbath .
Despite warnings(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) of stretched(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) positioning , there ’s little evidence that systematic traders sparked(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) the sharpest equity decline(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) in more than two years , according to Nomura Holdings Inc. While algorithmic funds were probably forced(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) to offload(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) some positions amid the carnage , algorithmic funds likely were n’t “ the main culprits , ” according to Nomura Holdings Inc. .
Instead , blame asset managers spooked(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) by deteriorating(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) fundamentals , like the coronavirus - induced hit to Friday ’s PMI reading .
In other words , humans woke(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) up to the growing(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) risk of a pandemic(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) -- and panicked(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) .
“ We get(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) the impression that a wide range of investors are now factoring(#included PRESENT_REF) in a previously unthinkable scenario , ” Masanari Takada , a quantitative strategist at Nomura , wrote(#included Tuesday) in a note on Tuesday .
Through most of last week , traders shrugged(#included last week) off warning signs including(#included last week) an announcement(#included last week) from Apple Inc. that the coronavirus was posing(#included last week) a bigger hit to sales and production(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) than previously expected(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) .
A day later , stocks duly rose(#included A day later) to another record .
But with reports(#included Monday) on Monday suggesting(#included Monday) authorities were struggling(#included Tuesday) to contain(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) the virus ’s spread , caution crept(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) in .
“ The main trigger seems(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) to have been human decisions(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) and non - technical factors , ” Masanari Takada , a quantitative strategist at Nomura , wrote(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) .
Funds that buy(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) and sell(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) based(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) on algorithmic signals are often blamed(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) for exacerbating(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) moves(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) whenever volatility spikes(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) .
blamed ’s because commodity trading advisers or CTAs mostly follow(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) market trends , while risk - parity and other volatility - sensitive products adjust(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) positions based(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) on price swings .
But not only did n’t commodity trading advisers or CTAs cause(#included Tuesday) Monday ’s sell - off , some quants actually made(#included Monday) money on it .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s models tell(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) a similar story to Nomura ’s .
While Monday ’s action breached(#included Tuesday) trend followers ’ short - term momentum levels , trend followers medium - term signals wo n’t flip(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) red until the S&P 500 Index drops(#included Monday’s) to the 2,900 - 3,100 range .
trend followers long - term signal is around 2,800 , a team led(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) by Bram Kaplan wrote(#included Monday) in a Monday note .
“ There remains(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) a healthy downside cushion before CTAs would need(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) to de - lever significantly , given(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) the strength of the rally over the past ~4 months , ” the strategists wrote(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) .
Monday ’s move(#included Monday) was likely too swift to register(#included Monday) with many programmatic investors who take(#included Monday’s) their cues from longer - term trends , according to Guido Baltussen , co - head of quant allocation at Robeco .
“ In general with the virus you have(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) sudden quick reactions .
sudden quick reactions are typically a bit too quick to be captured(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) by systematic models , ” Guido Baltussen , co - head of quant allocation at Robeco said(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) .
That ’s not to say(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) there ’s no more selling(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) to come(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) from programmatic players .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) volatility - targeting funds ’ equity exposure stands at about the 75th percentile , while CTAs ’ is around the 85th -- levels the strategists describe(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) as “ elevated(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) ( though not extreme ) . ”
Nathan Thooft , head of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management , is on the look - out to see(#overlap 2020-02-25 15:53:16) what these funds do before deciding(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) whether to buy(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) into any weakness .
“ There is a risk of unwinding(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) by systematic players that could lead(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) to more downside , ” said(#before 2020-02-25 15:53:16) Nathan Thooft , head of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management , .
