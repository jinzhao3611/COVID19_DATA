Gilead drug prevents(#overlap 2020-02-13 22:51:10) type of coronavirus in monkeys; raises(#overlap 2020-02-13 22:51:10) hope for China trials(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
An experimental Gilead Sciences ( GILD.O ) antiviral drug prevented(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) disease and reduced(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) the severity of symptoms in monkeys infected(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) , an infection closely related to the fast - spreading coronavirus that originated in China , a study published on Thursday found .

The results , reported(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , raise(#overlap 2020-02-13 22:51:10) hope that the drug , remdesivir , currently in clinical trials in China , might be effective against the new virus that has infected some 60,000 people globally , and killed(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) more than 1,300 , mostly in China .
However , the drug , remdesivir , currently in clinical trials in China had previously been shown(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) to be protective(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) in monkeys infected(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) with the new virus that has infected some 60,000 people globally , but shown did not translate(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) to humans .
“ the drug , remdesivir , currently in clinical trials in China was n’t successful(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) in Ebola , but there is some indication that the drug , remdesivir , currently in clinical trials in China might be successful in the coronaviruses , ” Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , said in a recent interview .
the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) scientists tested(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) remdesivir in monkeys 24 hours prior to infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) and in other monkeys 12 hours after infection - the time frame in monkeys when the new virus that has infected some 60,000 people globally is most active .
monkeys were compared(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) with untreated monkeys in a control group .
After six days , all of the untreated animals got(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) sick(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) .
In monkeys treated(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) prior to infection , Gilead drug appeared(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) to prevent(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) disease .
Animals in this group showed(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) no sign of infection , had(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) significantly lower levels of virus in their lungs and no lung damage .
Those treated after infection also fared(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) better than the control group .
Those treated after infection had(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) less severe disease , their lungs had(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) lower levels of virus and Those treated after infection had(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) less severe lung damage , researchers found(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) .
Many drugs that succeed(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) in monkeys fail(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) in humans .
Nevertheless , researchers said(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) researchers findings(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) bolster(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) hopes for the ongoing studies in China and for compassionate use of Gilead drug in severely ill patients .
a study published on Thursday found was supported(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) in part by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) , part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
A state - run Chinese research institute applied(#included last week) last week fora patent to use(#included 2020-W14) Gilead ’s experimental drug against the fast - spreading coronavirus that originated in China .
Dr. Marie - Paule Kieny , a former World Health Organization virologist who co(#included 2020-W14) a research forum in Geneva this week , said(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) Chinese researchers will soon start(#after 2020-02-13 22:51:10) testing(#after 2020-02-13 22:51:10) Gilead drug on patients , but it could be a few weeks before Chinese researchers know(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) whether Gilead drug is having(#before 2020-02-13 22:51:10) any effect .
