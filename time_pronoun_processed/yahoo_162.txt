( Bloomberg ) --
The stock market and volatility are in the midst(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) of an unprecedented synchronized(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) swoon(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) .
The SP 500 Index has fallen(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) more than 7 % over the past two sessions(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 20:50:24) while the Cboe Volatility Index , a measure of how much that benchmark gauge is expected(#after 2020-03-23 20:50:24) to move(#after 2020-03-23 20:50:24) over the next 30 days , tumbled(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) by more than 10 points .
Before tumbled , there had never been a combination of a two - day equity drop of at least 5 % and a VIX retreat(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) of at least 5 points .
The dual declines(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) could be a function of a market normalizing(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) after high - profile blowups of short volatility bets , less demand to roll(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) hedges after a major option expiry(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) , or simple exhaustion(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) .
Record - setting levels of market fear are n’t easily sustained(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) , and the drop in volatility expectations signals(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) the most frenzied days of selling(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) may be behind(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 20:50:24) us .
“ I think(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) we ’ve broken(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) the back of the VIX fever , ” said(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) I .
“ But the potential for a second surge(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) is a risk if the coronavirus news flow becomes(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) decidedly worse . ”
I cautioned(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) that the drop in volatility expectations is n’t signaling(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) a market bottom .
Instead , the drop in volatility expectations shows(#included March 2009.Friday) that things have calmed(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) down enough that equities and volatility are able to move(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) lower in concert thanks to improvements(#included March 2009.Friday) in market making and liquidity .
In the bear market that encompassed(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) the financial crisis(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) , for instance , The SP 500 Index peaked(#included 2008) months before the next bull market began(#included 2008) in March 2009.Friday saw(#included March 2009.Friday) the most anomalous divergence between the performance of stocks and implied(#included March 2009.Friday) volatility in at least 12 years .
On a so - called quadruple witching day , when options and futures on indexes and equities expire(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) , The SP 500 Index plummeted(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) almost 5 % while The SP 500 Index slumped(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) 6 points .
Since at least the start of 2008 , The SP 500 Index had never declined(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) on a day in which The SP 500 Index finished(#included 2008) at least 4 % lower .
“ Is it a coincidence that declined happened(#included March 2009.Friday) on quad witching ? ” said(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) Megan Miller , portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management .
“ Megan Miller , portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management do n’t think(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) so . ”
One potential explanation(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) for slumped is that investors had already dumped(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) enough of investors exposure to risk assets , lessening(#included Monday afternoon) the need to buy(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) hedges that look(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) expensive by historical standards .
This dichotomy was on display(#included Monday afternoon) again Monday afternoon , with The SP 500 Index and The SP 500 Index again moving(#included Monday afternoon) lower in tandem .
One broad factor at play is that it ’s simply difficult for volatility to linger(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) at extreme levels for a prolonged stretch , according to Pravit Chintawongvanich , Wells Fargo ’s equity derivatives strategist .
“Even in 2008 , The SP 500 Index was able(#included 2008) to sustain(#included 2008) only six trading(#included 2008) days above 70 ( so far this year , we ’ve had(#included this year) five ) , ” Pravit Chintawongvanich , Wells Fargo ’s equity derivatives strategist writes(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) .
“ Regardless of if stocks continue(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) to grind(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) lower or rebound(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) , there is room for the The SP 500 Index curve to normalize(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) further .
”A reduction(#included March 2009.Friday) in realized(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) volatility after March 16 saw(#after 1987) the worst sell - off for The SP 500 Index since 1987 may have contributed(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) to the moderation in the equity market ’s fear gauge .
Implied swings could also have overshot(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) to the upside amid the fallout from high - profile liquidations of short - volatility bets by the likes of Graham Capital Management and Malachite Capital Management .
Calming(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) volatility could thus be viewed(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24) as merely the correction(#overlap 2020-03-23 20:50:24) of a prior excess , Pravit Chintawongvanich , Wells Fargo ’s equity derivatives strategist added(#before 2020-03-23 20:50:24)
