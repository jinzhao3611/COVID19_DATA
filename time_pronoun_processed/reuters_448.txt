The The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) ’s measure seeks(#overlap 2020-05-04 20:23:29) to temporarily amend(#before 2020-05-04 20:23:29) existing(#before 2020-05-04 20:23:29) crowdfunding requirements but only if a company meets(#before 2020-05-04 20:23:29) “ the enhanced(#before 2020-05-04 20:23:29) eligibility requirements ” while providing(#overlap 2020-05-04 20:23:29) “ clear , prominent disclosure to investors about a company reliance on the relief , ” which will apply(#after 2020-05-04 20:23:29) to offerings(#before 2020-05-04 20:23:29) launched(#before 2020-05-04) between the effective date of the temporary rules and June 24 , 2011 , The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) said .
