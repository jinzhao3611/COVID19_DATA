Luke Sharrett for The New York Times March and early April could have been awfully exciting for the university ’s new mascot , a bulldog named Butler Blue IV , .
the university ’s new mascot , a bulldog named Butler Blue IV , , had been scheduled(#included last week) to travel(#included last week) from Indianapolis to New York for the Big East men ’s basketball tournament(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) .
If Butler had reached(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) the Final Four , Blue , as the puppy is known , would have made(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) the journey to Atlanta .
But both the conference(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) and national tournaments(#included last week) were canceled(#included last week) last week , and Blue , expected(#included early April) to take(#included early April) over mascot duties in May , stayed(#included January) home .
So did(#included January) his predecessor , Trip , the regal dog who had been teaching(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) the puppy the ropes around campus , where dorms will be closed(#before 2020-04-04) until at least April 4 and in - person classes(#included March) have been suspended(#before 2020-04-04) .
“ Selfishly , as basketball junkies and shills for these dogs , we ’re extremely sad , but that pales(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) in comparison to the heartbreak we ’re have(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) for we ’re seniors on we ’re basketball teams , and we ’re student - athletes who compete(#included spring) in spring sports , ” Michael Kaltenmark , Trip ’s handler , wrote in an email on Friday .
“ These recent developments(#included spring) are devastating for them , and terribly unfair , ” Michael Kaltenmark , Trip ’s handler , added(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) .
“ these dogs have had(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) these dogs day , and will have(#after 2020-03-16 15:14:26) more days in the limelight to come(#after 2020-03-16 15:14:26) .
But many of those athletes , who provide us a stage with which to bask in the glow , will have to hang(#included March) up many of those athletes , who provide us a stage with which to bask in the glow uniforms with a lack of proper closure . ”
But well before the coronavirus became(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) a pandemic(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) , we visited(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) Indianapolis to meet(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) Blue , as the puppy is known and see(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) how he was preparing(#before 2020-03-16 15:14:26) for the rigors of being a live mascot .
being was quite a process .
