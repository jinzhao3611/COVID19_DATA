'They would have been slaughtered':(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) Coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) causes(#overlap 2020-03-14 00:27:09) capital freeze(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) for Australian business .
2020-03-14 00:27:09 +00:00 .
The devastation(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) wrought(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) on the Australian stockmarket by the coronavirus pandemic has made(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) it impossible for companies to raise(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) fresh money , with two bank funding injections totalling(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) at least $ 2.5bn called(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) off .
Billions of dollars in other attempts(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) to raise(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) money have also been cancelled(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) as investors close(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) investors wallets after two wild weeks of trading(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) erased(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) more than a year ’s worth of gains(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) .
“ Effectively , the window to raise capital is closed(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) , ” said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) fund manager Geoff Wilson of Wilson Asset Management , who himself this week canned(#included this week) a plan for one of himself funds to buy(#after 2020-03-14 00:27:09) between $ 10 m and $ 20 m worth of shares back from investors .
Asked(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) if himself thought(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) the window to raise capital would open(#included seven) again any time soon , himself said(#included this week) : “ No .
“ It would only be the desperate who would be raising(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) [ money ] at the moment , ” another market observer said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) .
On Thursday evening , after the biggest one - day fall on the Australian market since 1987 , NAB abandoned(#included Thursday evening) plans to raise(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) about $ 2bn by selling(#included Thursday evening) investors notes – financial instruments that pay(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) a steady flow of coupons .
It ’s believed(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) abandoned was taken(#included Thursday evening) following(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) what sources said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) were “ robust ” discussions(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) by the NAB board .
Smaller rival Macquarie followed(#included Friday morning) suit on Thursday evening , as the Australian market was again plunging(#included Friday morning) , yanking(#included Friday morning) a $ 500 m note issue of the Australian market own .
The notes , known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt , carry(#overlap 2020-03-14 00:27:09) greater risk than either because The notes , known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt , are the first to take(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) losses(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) when things go(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) wrong .
But The notes , known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt , are extremely popular(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) with Australian mum - and - dad investors who have(#overlap 2020-03-14 00:27:09) confidence in the strength of the country ’s banking sector because The notes , known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt , provide(#overlap 2020-03-14 00:27:09) relatively high returns .
The prices of both were set(#included last month) last month , before the coronavirus pandemic smashed(#included Thursday evening) the Australian market .
But after the falls in the share prices of the banks –(#included this week) on Friday night , NAB ’s share price was down by a third since 20 February and Macquarie ’s down almost a quarter over the same period – The prices of both became(#included Friday night) wildly unrealistic .
Sources said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) that if the NAB and Macquarie notes had been issued(#included last month) at pre - crash values then the NAB and Macquarie notes prices would have immediately crashed(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) once the NAB and Macquarie notes began(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) to trade(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) , making(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) investors angry and leaving(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) the banks looking(#included Thursday evening) like the banks were under financial pressure(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) .
“ If the banks ’d proceeded(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) with it the banks would have been slaughtered(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) when the banks came(#included last month) on , ” one market source said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) of Macquarie notes .
“ Obviously it ’s bad for the investors but it ’s also really bad for NAB .
“ Which bank wants(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) to issue(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) capital at a massive discount ? ”
Sources say(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) figuring(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) out new prices for Macquarie notes was too hard because the markets were too volatile – a point proven(#included Friday) on Friday when , after dropping(#included Friday) 8 % in early trade(#included Friday) , the benchmark ASX 200 rallied(#included Friday) to finish(#included Friday) the day up more than 4 % .
Also on Friday , Pengana Private Equity Fund abandoned(#included Friday) a $ 470 m capital raising(#included Friday) , telling(#included Friday) the market that “ current market volatility makes(#included PRESENT_REF) it impossible to conduct(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) an orderly process ” .
The previous day , corporate lender Metrics Credit Partners handed(#included The previous day) more than $ 340 m back to investors after falling(#included The previous day) well short on corporate lender Metrics Credit Partners hopes to raise(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) up to $ 640 m and list(#after 2020-03-14 00:27:09) a fund on the benchmark ASX 200 .
Wilson said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) the market was in a “ fear phase ” .
“ This is the steepest fall NAB ’s ever seen(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) in the market , ” Wilson said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) .
Wilson said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) This combined(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) the speed of the falls experienced in the crash(#included 1987) of 1987 with the relentlessness of the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis(#included 2008) , when markets around the world fell(#included 1987) day after day after day .
“ This is the steepest fall NAB ’s ever seen(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) in the market , ” Wilson said(#before 2020-03-14 00:27:09) .
“ From the start of the bear market [ in 1987 ] to the bottom , that was about 50 % and that took(#included 1987) seven weeks .
“ We ’re a month in
and NAB ’s down something like 30 % . ”
