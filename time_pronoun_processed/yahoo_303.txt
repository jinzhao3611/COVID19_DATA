Investors have pulled(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) back from credit as worries(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) intensify(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) that the spreading coronavirus will slash(#after 2020-03-05 22:47:32) economic growth(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) and crimp(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) corporate cash flows .
A widely followed(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) derivatives index that measures(#overlap 2020-03-05 22:47:32) risk in U.S. credit markets has surged(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) in the past two weeks as investors rushed(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) to hedge(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) against losses(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) .
The market turmoil shut(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) the U.S. investment - grade bond market for six straight days before reopening(#included March 4) the week ended March 4 , and lending in the junk - bond and leveraged loan markets has slowed(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) to a trickle .
The withdrawal from investment - grade funds was the biggest since May 2019 , a period that was chalked(#before 2020-03-05 22:47:32) up to an internal transfer(#after December 2015) between Fidelity Investment funds , rather than a pullback by investors .
