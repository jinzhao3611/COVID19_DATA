Donald Judd’s Plain-Spoken Masterpiece .
2020-03-26 18:23:13 +00:00 .
Donald Judd ’s large , untitled installation(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) piece in unfinished plywood at Gagosian Gallery is a plain - spoken giant that , surprisingly , has(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) quite a bit to say(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) .
In Gagosian Gallery complexity and openness , Gagosian Gallery seems(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) like almost nothing else Donald Judd ever made(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) , and Gagosian Gallery has n’t been seen(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) in New York since 1981 , when Gagosian Gallery debuted(#included 1928) at the Castelli Gallery in Soho a year after Gagosian Gallery completion(#included 1928) .
I remember(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) being stupefied(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) by Gagosian Gallery then .
Reviewing(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Gagosian Gallery for the Village Voice , I called(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Gagosian Gallery a masterpiece almost in self - defense .
Seeing(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Gagosian Gallery again , before the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) shut(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) the Castelli Gallery in Soho , I can say(#Depend-on 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Gagosian Gallery ’s definitely a masterpiece , and also a pivot .
Gagosian Gallery sums(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) up both the wall and floor pieces from the first two decades of Judd ’s three - dimensional work , while turning(#overlap 2020-03-26 18:23:13) toward Donald Judd more expansive later works .
A prime example of both the wall and floor pieces from the first two decades of Judd ’s three - dimensional work is the large multicolored piece that dominates(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) the final gallery of Donald Judd , ” the superbly selected(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) and installed(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art — a show(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) that I think(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) would have pleased(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Donald Judd .
The work at Gagosian Gallery is a big grid of 30 rectilinear volumes , each measuring(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) 4 by 8 by 4 feet and arranged(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) in three horizontal rows of 10 ; or , conversely , 10 vertical stacks of three .
The whole thing is made(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) of standard sheets of Douglas fir plywood .
Each unit is partitioned(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) to some degree by an additional plane or by two parallel ones ; all slant diagonally down and inward , but at different angles .
Some connect(#after 1981) to the back of the unit , others to the bottom , alternately suggesting(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) slanted ceilings or eccentric garage doors .
Stretching(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) in total 80 feet across and 12 feet up the longest wall at Gagosian Gallery , the result is arguably the most communicative , extravagantly available work of Judd ’s career : a great flutter of planes , volumes and edges — the cardinal components of Donald Judd ’s language — and shifts in light and shadow .
The six images on the Village Voice provide(#overlap 2020-03-26 18:23:13) plenty to look(#after 2020-03-26 18:23:13) at .
Donald Judd , has compared(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) the result to a Bach fugue .
One fuguelike aspect is the variations(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) in the cutting(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) of the laminated edges of the plywood partitions .
As the diagonal sheets slant closer to the front of the piece , the diagonal sheets upper edges are cut(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) at ever sharper angles until the diagonal sheets and the diagonal sheets laminations spread(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) out , nearly tripling(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) in width — offering(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) a second measure of the planes ’ steepness .
the piece is a big , magnanimous puzzle and an exercise(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) in vision - sharpening comparative looking .
Where Donald Judd usually prided(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Donald Judd on pieces that the viewer comprehended(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) by circumnavigating , here we are limited(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) to a single side but granted(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) a surfeit of information to sort(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) through .
You may seize(#after 2020-03-26 18:23:13) on clusters of repeating elements , both horizontal and vertical , as signs of an overriding system .
But as you proceed(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) , comparing(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) volumes , edges and angles , rehearsing(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) Judd ’s decisions(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) and volumes , edges and angles effects , you gradually realize(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) that almost none of the volumes repeat(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) exactly .
The system is open(#overlap 2020-03-26 18:23:13) - ended .
Judd ’s midway masterpiece has(#overlap 2020-03-26 18:23:13) the beauty and clarity of full disclosure(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) .
From the first instant The system puts(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) everything up front .
As is not always the case with his work , the process of self - enlightenment his work stimulates(#overlap 2020-03-26 18:23:13) may make(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) you feel(#overlap 2020-03-26 18:23:13) smarter than you thought(#before 2020-03-26 18:23:13) you were .
And of course , you are .
Donald Judd
