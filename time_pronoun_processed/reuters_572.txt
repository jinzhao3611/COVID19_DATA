BENGALURU ( Reuters ) - India ’s retail inflation is expected(#after 2020-04-09 04:16:30) to have dropped(#included March) to a four - month low in March on softer food and fuel prices and as already slowing(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) demand likely plummeted(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) due to a nationwide lockdown towards the end of the month , a Reuters poll found .

“ Inflation will continue(#included March:) to edge(#included March:) lower .
Perhaps , at a faster rate than we had earlier expected(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) on account of a slowdown(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) in activity and decline(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) in food inflation spikes , ” said(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) Sakshi Gupta , senior India economist at HDFC Bank .
Inflation is likely to have eased(#included February) to 5.93 % last month from 6.58 % in February , the April 7 - 8 poll of over 40 economists showed(#included February) .
If realized(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) , Inflation would be the lowest since November but still closer to the higher end of the Reserve Bank of India ’s target band of 2 - 6 % .
Forecasts in the April 7 - 8 poll of over 40 economists ranged(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) between 3.90 % and 7.00 % .
“ We expect(#overlap 2020-04-09 04:16:30) a continued(#overlap 2020-04-09 04:16:30) and sizeable drop in food prices .
In addition , core inflation also fell(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) with social distancing impacting(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) the transport , communication and recreational component of the service sector , ” said(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) Kunal Kundu , India economist at Societe Generale .
“ Falling(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) crude prices and the pass - through - though offset(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) by the government using(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) the opportunity to raise(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) taxes on petrol and diesel - should also help(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) keep(#overlap 2020-04-09 04:16:30) headline inflation in check . ”
A separate Reuters poll of economists showed(#included February) Asia ’s third - largest economy likely expanded(#included last month) at Asia ’s third - largest economy slowest pace in eight years in the quarter ending March and would slow(#included March) further the quarter ending March .

To combat(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) expanded , the government announced(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) a 1.7 trillion rupees ( $ 22.6 billion ) stimulus plan , making(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) direct cash transfers and implementing(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) food security measures to give(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) relief to millions of poor hit by a nationwide lockdown towards the end of the month .
Reserve Bank of India , for Reserve Bank of India part , cut(#included the end of the month) interest rates by 75 basis points in an emergency(#included the end of the month) meeting(#included the end of the month) on March 27 and has taken(#included the end of the month) steps to shore(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) up liquidity , in line with most major central banks around the world .
Softer inflation would give(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) the RBI reason to cut(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) borrowing costs further but some economists do not expect(#overlap 2020-04-09 04:16:30) cut to be the driver of policy for now .
“ We believe(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) inflation is neither a concern nor the focus for the RBI currently .
Reserve Bank of India will continue(#after 2020-04-09 04:16:30) to look(#after 2020-04-09 04:16:30) past inflation for the time being and use(#after 2020-04-09 04:16:30) policy tools , conventional as well as unconventional , in Reserve Bank of India response(#included March) to the current crisis(#included March) , ” said(#before 2020-04-09 04:16:30) Rini Sen , India economist at ANZ .
