Facing(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) mounting(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) scrutiny over one New Yorker who lost his 88 - year - old father to the virus decision(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to send(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) recovering(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) coronavirus patients to nursing homes across the Empire State , a new report has(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) a number attached(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 's controversial executive order : at least 4,300 .
the AP 's tally comes(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) from the Associated Press , not the Empire State .
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 's controversial executive order was intended(#included March 25) to ease(#included March 25) the burden on hospitals dealing(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) with the most critical COVID-19 patients .
But by sending(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) elderly New Yorkers recovering(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) from COVID-19 to nursing homes , the virus spread among the most vulnerable and has since resulted(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) in 5,800 deaths(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) at New York nursing homes and adult care facilities .
The New York State Department of Health did not offer(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) The New York State Department of Health own count to AP and said(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) The New York State Department of Health could not verify(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) the AP 's tally , citing(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) the Empire State process of " still validating(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) our own comprehensive survey of nursing homes admission(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) and re - admission data . "
On May 10 , NY Gov. Cuomo reversed(#included May 10) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 's controversial executive order .
NY Gov. Cuomo continued(#included March 25) to defend(#included March 25) reversed at NY Gov. Cuomo press briefings this week by arguing(#included this week) NY Gov. Cuomo was simply following(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) The New York State Department of Health guidelines .
Elsewhere , NY Gov. Cuomo has made(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) no bones about breaking(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) from the federal government when it comes(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to going(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) beyond the federal government guidances in other instances — particularly with New York on PAUSE , NY Gov. Cuomo stay - at - home order .
NY Gov. Cuomo has also pointed(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to state statutes mandating(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) that nursing homes move(#after 2020-05-22 17:09:41) patients from patients facilities if patients can not receive(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) adequate care on the premises , though New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 's controversial executive order stated(#included March 25) " no resident shall be denied(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) re - admission or admission(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to the ( nursing home ) solely based(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) [ on a confirmed(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) or suspected(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) COVID-19 diagnosis ] . "
However , other states , such as Louisiana , implemented(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) measures(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to insulate(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) nursing homes from the spread .
the Empire State put(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) a 30 day hold on hospitals sending(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) any recovering(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) virus patients to nursing homes — with some exceptions — and saw(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) only 1,000 COVID - related deaths(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) in nursing homes .
New York nursing home workers and experts interviewed(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) by AP described(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) care centers being overrun(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) with incoming(#overlap 2020-05-22 17:09:41) COVID patients , and those who lost loved ones to the virus made(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) those who lost loved ones to the virus anger known(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) .
" It was the single dumbest decision(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) anyone could make(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) if anyone wanted(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) to kill(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) people , " Daniel Arbeeny told(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) AP , having lost(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) his 88 - year - old father to the virus after pulling(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) his 88 - year - old father out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) more than 50 deaths(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) .
" This is n't rocket science , " Daniel Arbeeny said(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) .
" AP knew(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) the most vulnerable — the elderly and compromised(#before 2020-05-22 17:09:41) — are in nursing homes and rehab centers . "
