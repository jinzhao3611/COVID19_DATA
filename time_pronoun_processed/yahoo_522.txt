2020-05-18 15:05:24 +00:00 .
( Bloomberg ) -- Hedge funds , market - making firms and other traders across Europe can resume(#included this week) short - selling of equities this week after regulators lifted(#included this week) bans put in place when markets plunged during March ’s coronavirus outbreak .
Six European countries including(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) France , Spain , and Austria said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) short - selling can begin(#included Tuesday) again on Tuesday as bans put in place when markets plunged during March ’s coronavirus outbreak will not be renewed(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) .
Italy ’s prohibition(#included June) , slated(#included June) to end(#included June) in June , will also now end(#included today) today , as will Greek and Belgian curbs(#included Tuesday) .
Muddy Waters founder Carson Block welcomed(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) lifted and predicted(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) that any analysis(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) on the impact of short - selling bans in Europe will show(#after 2020-05-18 15:05:24) short - selling bans in Europe were ultimately “ unhelpful . ”
“ We note(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) that since short - selling bans in Europe were imposed(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) , the CAC 40 index has risen(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) only 10 % , while the DAX and SP 500 , which cover(#overlap 2020-05-18 15:05:24) markets that did not impose(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) bans , have each risen(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) almost 20 % , ” Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) in an email , referring(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) to France , Germany and the U.S.
short - selling bans in Europe were put(#included mid - March) in place in mid - March when regulators said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) such trading(#included this week) could exacerbate(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) the steep declines(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) in equity markets .
Stephane Ekolo , an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London , said(#included Monday) Monday ’s move(#included Monday) is “ positive for price discovery(#included Monday) . ”
Stephane Ekolo , an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London , expects(#overlap 2020-05-18 15:05:24) many stocks to revert(#after 2020-05-18 15:05:24) to the negative trend many stocks had(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) prior to short - selling bans in Europe , as was the case after the 2008 short - selling bans(#included 2008) .
Short - selling , in which traders sell borrowed shares to profit from any fall in price , is controversial at the best of times .
Proponents say(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) Short - selling , in which traders sell borrowed shares to profit from any fall in price , results(#after 2020-05-18 15:05:24) in a more liquid , efficient market , and alerts(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) investors to problems at targeted(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) firms .
Opponents accuse(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) short - sellers of destabilizing(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) companies .
“ Short - selling is an activity that is part of a well - functioning market , ” Robert Ophele , chairman of France ’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers , said(#included Monday) Monday in a Bloomberg TV interview(#included Monday) .
Robert Ophele , chairman of France ’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers , said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) the restrictions “ did n’t have(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) any detrimental effects ” on a well - functioning market and Robert Ophele , chairman of France ’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers , looks(#overlap 2020-05-18 15:05:24) forward to subsequent research(#after 2020-05-18 15:05:24) on the effect of the restrictions .
John Moore , head of trading(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) at Berkeley Capital Wealth Management , took(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) a principled position after regulators announced(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) the end of the bans .
“ If we believe(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) a company is overvalued , we want(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) to be able to short(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) a company , ” Robert Ophele , chairman of France ’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers , said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) .
“ That ’s what makes(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) a market .
We do n’t think(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) there should be any restrictions(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) or limits on that . ”
Regulators in France and Italy said(#included Monday) on Monday that the restrictions are no longer needed(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) because trading(#included Monday) has become(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) more normal .
While volatility is higher than volatility was in February before March ’s coronavirus outbreak , Berkeley Capital Wealth Management said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) said is more a reflection of traders ’ uncertainty about the future .
“ We understood(#included March) the rationale of the ban(#included March) on short - selling in March to ‘ cool down ’ the markets when everyone was selling(#included this week) everything at the same time , ” said(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) Stephane Boujnah , chief executive officer of Euronext NV .
“ However , now that volatility has somewhat returned(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) to normal and there is much more diversification across trading(#included now) patterns , this is a wise decision(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) . ”
The European Securities and Markets Authority , the Paris - based regulator that oversees standards across the bloc , coordinated(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) the end of the bans .
The European Securities and Markets Authority , the Paris - based regulator that oversees standards across the bloc , will continue(#after 2020-05-18 15:05:24) to require(#after 2020-05-18 15:05:24) increased(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) disclosure(#before 2020-05-18 15:05:24) of short positions until at least June 16 .
