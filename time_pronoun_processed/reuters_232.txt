The rethinking(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) on price comes(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) as dealmakers had hoped(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) Australia ’s relatively low number of coronavirus cases would leave(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) Australia as a dealmaking sweetspot , while so many other Asia - Pacific economies , including(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) China , the region ’s biggest driver of takeovers(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) , were hit(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) hard by the coronavirus .
But stocks in Sydney have suffered(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) as much as others .

Binding(#included 2020-03-30) offers for the ANZ and AMP assets were due by Monday , one of two sources with knowledge of the deals said(#before 2020-03-17 00:20:20) .
