A Reuters witness saw(#included 2020-04-05) several masked protesters , clad(#included 2020-04-05) in black , rush(#included 2020-04-05) into the public housing block in the Fanling district near to the border with China , and set(#included 2020-04-05) alight(#included 2020-04-05) a Molotov cocktail before running(#included 2020-04-05) out .
Black smoke could be seen(#included 2020-04-05) pouring(#included 2020-04-05) out of a newly built residential building in Hong Kong to the sound of fire alarms .
Windows were smashed(#included 2020-04-05) .
The fire was later put(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) out by firefighters and the damage appeared(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) to be confined(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) to the lobby area .
Hundreds of riot police also moved(#included 2020-04-05) in , arresting(#included 2020-04-05) at least one person .
As fears(#overlap 2020-01-26 14:11:15) about the coronavirus outbreak intensify(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) , calls(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) have grown(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) for Hong Kong to block(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) the financial hub ’s border with mainland China to minimize(#after 2020-01-26 14:11:15) the risk of infection .
Earlier in the afternoon , hundreds of regular Hong Kong citizens had blocked(#included 2020-04-05) roads leading(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) to a newly built residential building in Hong Kong with bricks and other debris , to protest(#included 2020-04-05) plans to convert(#after 2020-01-26 14:11:15) a newly built residential building in Hong Kong into a quarantine zone as the number of confirmed(#included 2020-04-05) cases in the city climbed(#included January 26 , 2020) to six .
“ We are dissatisfied(#overlap 2020-01-26 14:11:15) with the government selecting(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) a newly built residential building in Hong Kong as a ( quarantine(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) ) separation village as a newly built residential building in Hong Kong ’s very close to a residential area and a primary school , ” said(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) a 28 - year - old resident surnamed(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) Tsang .
Hong Kong has been convulsed(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) with protests(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) over the last seven months centered(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) on Hong Kong ’s relationship with mainland China : with some protesters railing(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) against what some protesters see(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) as growing(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) interference(#overlap 2020-01-26 14:11:15) from Beijing .
Beijing denies(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) meddling and blames(#overlap 2020-01-26 14:11:15) the West for stirring(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) trouble in Hong Kong .
the coronavirus outbreak has piled(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) further pressure on embattled Hong Kong authorities , who have so far refused(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) to categorically block(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) the flow of visitors from mainland China across several land border crossings(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) .
Direct train and flight(#overlap 2020-01-26 14:11:15) connections to and from the Chinese city of Wuhan have , however , been suspended(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) .
Hong Kong authorities had earlier said(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) Hong Kong authorities would convert(#after 2020-01-26 14:11:15) a newly built residential building in Hong Kong , into temporary flats for quarantine(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) and observation of close contact(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) persons without symptoms if needed(#Depend-on 2020-01-26 14:11:15) . ”
But after the protest(#included 2020-04-05) , the government said(#included 2020-04-05) in a statement(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) the government would “ cease(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) the related preparation(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) work in a newly built residential building in Hong Kong . ”
Health authorities in the afternoon said(#included 2020-04-05) 107 people were now under quarantine(#included PRESENT_REF) , and there were 77 suspected(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) cases .
The ability of the coronavirus from the Chinese city of Wuhan to spread(#after 2020-01-26 14:11:15) is strengthening(#overlap 2020-01-26 14:11:15) and infections could continue(#after 2020-01-26 14:11:15) to rise(#after 2020-01-26 14:11:15) , China ’s National Health Commission said(#included 2020-04-05) on Sunday , with nearly 2,000 people in China infected(#included 2020-04-05) and 56 killed(#before 2020-01-26 14:11:15) by the coronavirus outbreak .
