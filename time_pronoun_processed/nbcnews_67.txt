Another wave of 6.6 million American workers filed(#included March 21) first - time unemployment claims for the week ending April 4 , bringing(#included March 21) the cumulative total to an astonishing 16 million over the past three weeks .

“ So far , jobless claims look(#included weekday mornings) to me like the only limitation(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) on the number of applications(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) has been the states ’ ability to process(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) jobless claims , ” said(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) me .
The cumulative toll of the past three weeks comes(#included April 4) as last week ’s Labor Department release(#included Last week) showed(#included March 21) that the economy shed(#included April 4) 701,000 jobs in March — a figure far more negative than anticipated(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) , although economists said(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) the economy only captured(#included the) a fraction of the carnage(#included Last week) in the labor market that largely took(#included the week) place in the second half of the month .

“ People are so fixated(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) on the labor market and the impairment(#overlap 2020-04-09 12:37:53) of the labor market because the first wave of job losses hit hardest in consumer - facing sectors such as leisure , hospitality and retail does drive(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) what we expect(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) for GDP contraction(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) , ” me said(#before 2020-04-09 12:37:53) .
