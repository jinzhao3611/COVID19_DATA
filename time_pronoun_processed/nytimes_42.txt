2020-03-24 14:03:37 +00:00 .
Fashion is no longer just waiting(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) for the government to swoop(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) in and save(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) Fashion .
Seventeen years ago , in the time after Sept. 11 , which brought(#included This week) New York Fashion Week to a terrible halt(#included Week) and cast(#included Week) a long , damaging shadow on many young designer businesses , Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America got(#included Seventeen years ago) together and established(#included Seventeen years ago) the CFDA / Vogue Fashion Fund : an annual competition for new creative talents involving a monetary prize , networking and mentorship .
This week , in the time of the new coronavirus , which has brought life as we know it to a halt , and is already damaging(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) young designer businesses , Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America are repurposing(#included This week) the new coronavirus , which has brought life as we know it to a halt .
the CFDA / Vogue Fashion Fund is dead(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) ( at least for a year ; the CFDA / Vogue Fashion Fund may return(#included 2021) in 2021 ) .
Long live A Common Thread .
A Common Thread is a “ fund(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) initiative(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) supporting(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) those in the American fashion community who have been impacted(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) by the Covid-19 pandemic , ” according to a news release from Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America .
Through A Common Thread , cash - strapped designers and manufacturers will be able(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) to apply(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) for funding to help(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) cash - strapped designers and manufacturers through the period in which cash - strapped designers and manufacturers businesses have been effectively shuttered(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) by government decree .
The grant money previously earmarked for the Fashion Fund recipients ( approximately $ 700,000 for the winner and two runners - up ) will presumably form(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) the base purse , and Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America will also begin(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) a campaign(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) to further build(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) The grant money previously earmarked for the Fashion Fund recipients ( approximately $ 700,000 for the winner and two runners - up ) out , based(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) around short videos debuting(#included March 25) March 25 on the digital platforms of Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America and featuring fashion folk “ whose businesses and livelihoods have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Covid-19 pandemic economic impact . ”
Not just designers , but seamstresses , patternmakers , manufacturers — all members of the fashion supply chain .
It is a fitting second life for an initiative(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) that began(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) in one crisis(#included March 25) but often seemed(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) to have lost(#included the last decade) its urgency in the last decade .
( It ’s hard to find(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) 10 worthy new finalists every year to compete(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) . ) .
Though the CFDA / Vogue Fashion Fund crowned(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) such well - known winners and finalists as Proenza Schouler , Joseph Altuzarra , Rag Bone , Telfar and Kerby Jean - Raymond of Pyer Moss , just as many have experienced(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) a brief flurry of fame and then largely disappeared(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) : Doo - Ri Chung , Behnaz Sarafpour , Trovata , Rogan , Suno .
Even a glamorous prize could not help(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) .
Redirecting(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) the money and good will not at publicizing(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) a small group of potential stars , but at bolstering(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) the back ends of many functioning(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) business may be the most modern possible evolution(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) of the idea .
( Applicants do n’t even have to be part of the club ; being a the CFDA member or the CFDA / Vogue Fashion Fund participant is not a requirement . )
The news follows(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) an announcement(#included March 25) on Instagram by Kerby Jean - Raymond of Pyer Moss that Kerby Jean - Raymond of Pyer Moss would be “ setting(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) aside $ 50,000 for minority and women owned(#included currently) small creative businesses currently in distress(#included currently) . ”
It is unclear(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) at the moment what size grants(#overlap 2020-03-24 14:03:37) the A Common Thread fund will be able to disperse(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) , or what the criteria for recipients will be — or even who will be on the committee that decides(#after 2020-03-24 14:03:37) who gets(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) what .
But according to insiders , both Anna Wintour , the editor of Vogue , and Tom Ford , the chairman of the CFDA , felt(#before 2020-03-24 14:03:37) it was imperative that both Anna Wintour , the editor of Vogue , and Tom Ford , the chairman of the CFDA , act(#included March 25) as soon as possible to support(#included the last decade) both Anna Wintour , the editor of Vogue , and Tom Ford , the chairman of the CFDA , community .

Not too much later , though .
The first applications will be available(#included April 8) April 8 .
