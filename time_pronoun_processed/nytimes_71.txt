Stop(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) Touching(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) Your Face! .

“ I was really surprised(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) , ” I said(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) .
“ By touching(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your mucous membranes , you ’re giving(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) a virus 11 opportunities every hour if you ’re touched(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) something infectious . ”
The risk of picking(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) up a virus by hand - to - face contact(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) depends(#overlap 2020-03-02 10:00:59) on a number of factors , including(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) the type of virus , whether the surface was nonporous , how long ago a virus was left(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) behind , how much time the infected person spent(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) in the area and the temperature and humidity levels .
The World Health Organization notes(#overlap 2020-03-02 10:00:59) that while we do n’t know(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) how long the new coronavirus survives(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) on surfaces , the new coronavirus seems(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) to behave like other coronaviruses — which is unsettling news .
A recent study from the Journal of Hospital Infection found(#included recent) that similar coronaviruses have been shown(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) to survive(#overlap 2020-03-02 10:00:59) on surfaces for as long as nine days under ideal conditions .
survive ’s far longer than a virus .
The World Health Organization says(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) that , based(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) on studies of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS , “ the risk of picking(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) up a live virus from a contaminated surface ” under real - life conditions “ is likely to be reduced(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) significantly after 72 hours . ”
In general , a virus will survive(#after 2020-03-02 10:00:59) the longest on nonporous surfaces made(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) of metal and plastics — including(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) door knobs , counters and railings .
A virus will die(#after 2020-03-02 10:00:59) sooner on fabrics or tissues .
Once on your hand , a virus begins(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) to lose(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) potency , but a virus will probably live(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) long enough for you to touch(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your face .
Although more study is needed(#overlap 2020-03-02 10:00:59) of coronavirus , in one study of rhinovirus , which causes the common cold , a small dose of virus was placed(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) on a participant ’s finger .
An hour later , about 40 percent of a virus was still viable .
After three hours , 16 percent could still be detected(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) .
We also know(#included 2003) from the 2003 epidemic of SARS , a more deadly coronavirus than the one currently spreading , that a virus was often transmitted(#included 2003) from surface contact(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) .
In one Hong Kong hotel , an infected doctor who checked into his room on the ninth floor before going to the hospital for treatment left(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) a trail of virus that infected(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) at least seven people who also had(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) rooms on the ninth floor , who then went(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) on to spread(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) a virus elsewhere .
an infected doctor who checked into his room on the ninth floor before going to the hospital for treatment was later identified(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) as a “ super spreader ” linked(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) to about 4,000 cases of SARS that occurred(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) during the 2003 epidemic of SARS , a more deadly coronavirus than the one currently spreading .
The good news is that frequent hand washing can make(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) a meaningful difference in lowering(#overlap 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your risk .
During the 2003 epidemic of SARS , a more deadly coronavirus than the one currently spreading , hand - washing reduced(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent .
But after washing(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your hands , you must still be mindful about face touching(#overlap 2020-03-02 10:00:59) , Dr. Sawyer said(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) .
“ your hands are only clean until the next surface you touch(#included 2003) , ” Dr. Sawyer said(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) .
“ When you reach(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) for the door knob or hand railing , you ’ve recontaminated(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your hand with something .
If you touch(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your mucous membranes , then you could inoculate(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) yourself inadvertently with that organism .
If there is one behavior change that could prevent infection , one behavior change that could prevent infection ’s do not touch(#before 2020-03-02 10:00:59) your T - zone . ”
