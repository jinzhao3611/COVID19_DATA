How will England's coronavirus test(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) and trace system work .
2020-05-27 16:39:20 +00:00 .
The new “ NHS test and trace ” system kicks(#included early) in when a patient receives(#included early) a positive test(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) result for coronavirus .
Unlike in the early days of the outbreak(#included early) , everyone experiencing(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) symptoms will be expected(#included early) to take(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) a test .
At the same time as ordering(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) a test , by calling 119 , or going(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to the NHS website , patients will be asked(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to take(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) part in the tracking(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) programme .
If the result of a test is positive(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , anyone patients have been in close contact(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) with will then be contacted(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , and asked(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to self(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) for 14 days , even if patients have(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) no symptoms .
It means anyone who has been within 2 metres of the infected person for more than 15 minutes without protective equipment - something test and trace chief Dido Harding says(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) should be rare if workplaces are operating(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) in accordance with “ Covid - secure ” guidelines .
The government also hopes(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the requirements of the new system in England will focus(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the public ’s minds on the importance of continuing(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to stay(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) 2 metres apart(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) from others , as much as possible .
Once the app is up and running(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , the patient ’s mobile phone should automatically identify(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) anyone the patient ’s mobile phone have come(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) close to .
But until identify happens , patients will be asked(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to identify(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) likely contacts patients , via an online process .
Matt Hancock , the health secretary , announced(#included earlier this month) the pilot of a new NHS tracing app on the Isle of Wight earlier this month , and had hoped(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) a new NHS tracing app would form(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) an integral part of the new system in England , saying(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) : “ Where the Isle of Wight leads(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , Britain follows(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) . ”
But the Isle of Wight is yet to be cleared(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) for launch(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , as developers tackle(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) glitches .
Ministers have been stressing(#included recently) more recently that on - the - ground tracing(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , involving(#included recently) local public health teams as well as call - centre staff , is more important .
Not to begin(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) with .
Matt Hancock , the health secretary , stressed that , for the time being , the new system in England will rely(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) on the voluntary compliance of the public .
But ministers do have(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the legal power to enforce(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) self - isolation requirements with fines(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , if it is deemed(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) necessary at a later stage .
Travellers who break the new quarantine regime for arrivals at airports and ports will already be charged(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) up to £ 1,000 if Travellers who break the new quarantine regime for arrivals at airports and ports breach(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the restrictions(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) .
The latest official daily testing(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) capacity figure was a record 154,120 , and the Department of Health insists(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the Department of Health will achieve(#included the) the 200,000 - a - day target set(#included the) by the prime minister by the end of May – later this week .
Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) that long waits(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) for some test(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) results(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) could hamper(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the effectiveness of the new system in England .
Matt Hancock , the health secretary , has acknowledged(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) that Matt Hancock , the health secretary , is keen to increase(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the speed of the new system in England , including(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the turnaround times for results , some of which are still taking(#included recently) more than 24 hours to return(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) .
They should n’t : Matt Hancock , the health secretary , suggested(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) if people in a particular workplace or local area appear are repeatedly showing(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) up as in close contact with sufferers , local public health authorities could intervene(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to investigate(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) .
Part of the rationale for the new system in England is meant(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) to be to allow(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) local , small - scale action to be taken(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) , such as shutting(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) down particular services(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) or businesses , where there appears to be an outbreak(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) .
No .
Scientific advice remains(#overlap 2020-05-27 16:39:20) that we can not be certain whether having had(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) the virus means a patient has(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) immunity .
So even someone who has had a positive test for Covid-19 in the past , will have to stay(#after 2020-05-27 16:39:20) at home for 14 days if even someone who has had a positive test for Covid-19 in the past have come(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) into contact(#before 2020-05-27 16:39:20) with a new sufferer .
