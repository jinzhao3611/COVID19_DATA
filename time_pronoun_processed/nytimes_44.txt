Among the many horrors of the Iran - Iraq war was the use of chemical and nerve gas against Iran by Saddam Hussein , who at the time was supported(#before 2020-03-24 05:21:40) by the United States and European countries .

But during the Iran - Iraq war , West Germany , Austria and Spain opened(#before 2020-03-24 05:21:40) West Germany , Austria and Spain doors to Iranian survivors of chemical warfare .
Some of those medical exchanges continue(#overlap 2020-03-24 05:21:40) , and Some of those medical exchanges have helped(#before 2020-03-24 05:21:40) repair(#before 2020-03-24 05:21:40) relations between Iran and West Germany , Austria and Spain .

If the Trump administration continues(#before 2020-03-24 05:21:40) to block(#before 2020-03-24 05:21:40) international economic activity with Iran , a country of 80 million people will be abandoned(#after 2020-03-24 05:21:40) — and the world could suffer(#after 2020-03-24 05:21:40) the consequences of the unfettered spread of a deadly disease .
