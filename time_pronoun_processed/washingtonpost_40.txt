2020-03-20 16:54:01 +00:00 .
“ We wish(#overlap 2020-03-20 16:54:01) Shakira and Olivia all the best as Shakira and Olivia look(#overlap 2020-03-20 16:54:01) for new opportunities , ” Coach Brenda Frese said(#included 2020-04-03) Friday in a statement(#included 2020-04-03) released(#included 2020-04-03) to The Washington Post .
“ We are grateful(#overlap 2020-03-20 16:54:01) for Shakira and Olivia hard work(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) and Shakira and Olivia time here with We Maryland family .
Shakira and Olivia contributed(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) to championships here at Maryland , and those memories will last(#after 2020-03-20 16:54:01) a lifetime . ”
Austin ’s departure(#included this year) is a significant blow(#included this year) to Maryland .
The sophomore from Virginia gave(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) the Terps a significant height advantage against most Big Ten teams and averaged(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) 12 points and 6.8 rebounds per game , second on the team in both categories .
Owens , who played behind Austin , redshirted(#included this year) this year after a bout(#included this year) of mononucleosis in the fall .
Just as meaningful is that Austin ’s and Owens ’ departures leave(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) Maryland with only eight roster players for the 2020 - 21 season — just as it finally looked(#included 2017) like the Terps had rebounded(#included 2017) from a rash of transfers in 2017 that left(#included 2017) the roster undermanned(#overlap 2020-03-20 16:54:01) .
Sophomore guard Taylor Mikesell will be the lone full - time returning(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) starter , although freshman point guard Ashley Owusu started(#included this year) 16 games , most of which were non - conference contests(#included this year) at the start of the season .
Junior point guard Channise Lewis , who missed the entire year after tearing the lateral meniscus in her left knee during the preseason , will be the team ’s only senior .
Coach Brenda Frese adds(#included next year) just one new player next year in 6 - foot-3 forward Angel Reese .
Coach Brenda Frese is the No . 2 overall player in the Class of 2020 , per ESPN , but was the only player to sign(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) with Maryland in an uncharacteristically small recruiting class for Coach Brenda Frese .
Sophomore forward Mimi Collins , a transfer from Tennessee , and freshman guard Zoe Young will also suit(#after 2020-03-20 16:54:01) up for the Terps next season after Shakira and Olivia sat(#included this year) out this year .
Sophomore forward Mimi Collins , a transfer from Tennessee , and freshman guard Zoe Young decided(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) to take(#after 2020-03-20 16:54:01) a redshirt year to better(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) learn(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) Maryland ’s system , and freshman guard Zoe Young suffered(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) a torn ACL before the season began(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) .
The timing of Austin ’s and Owens ’ departures makes(#included this spring) finding(#included this spring) a transfer player this spring to help(#included this spring) bolster(#included this spring) the roster more difficult than usual .
The NCAA froze(#before April 15) all in - person recruiting(#included 2020) until at least April 15 because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-20 16:54:01) , meaning(#included next year) Coach Brenda Frese can contact(#overlap 2020-03-20 16:54:01) any potential transfers on the market via text , email or phone call but Maryland ca n’t host players on campus or make in - home visits .
Even if the in - person recruiting(#included 2020) ban(#included next year) lifts(#included 2020) after April 15 , Coach Brenda Frese made(#included this year) the point over the weekend that coaches do n’t know(#overlap 2020-03-20 16:54:01) what campus visits(#included 2020) will look(#after 2020-03-20 16:54:01) like if students do n’t come(#included next year) back to school after spring break .
Maryland announced(#included 2020-04-03) Thursday that all undergraduate classes will be conducted(#included next year) online through the end of the semester(#Depend-on 2020-03-20 16:54:01) .
