Josh Frydenberg ’s eligibility has been challenged(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) in the federal court by a Kooyong constituent , Michael Staindl , who alleges he is disqualified by section 44(1 ) of the constitution because he is a citizen of Hungary , which Josh Frydenberg denies(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) .
the federal court heard(#included February) challenged in February .

While a favourable ruling for Josh Frydenberg would lift(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) a constitutional cloud hanging(#overlap 2020-03-16 21:34:37) over a Kooyong constituent , Michael Staindl , who alleges he is disqualified by section 44(1 ) of the constitution because he is a citizen of Hungary , judgment also has(#overlap 2020-03-16 21:34:37) the potential to eject(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) the federal treasurer from the Australian parliament as the federal treasurer puts(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) together Australia ’s economic response to the coronavirus and to re - enliven questions about the validity of ministerial decisions(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) made by ineligible MPs .
On Thursday the federal government unveiled(#included 2020-04-02) a $ 17.6bn package to boost(#included 2020-04-02) the Australian economy and has already signalled(#included 2020-04-02) a second round of stimulus(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) is coming(#overlap 2020-03-16 21:34:37) for sectors including(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) airlines , tourism , events , sport and the arts .

Events are moving(#overlap 2020-03-16 21:34:37) so rapidly the federal government is telegraphing(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) round two even though the federal government is yet to legislate(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) the federal government first tranche of stimulus(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) measures(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) .
Legislating(#included next week) round one will happen(#included next week) next week , with the Australian parliament expected(#included next week) to gather(#after 2020-03-16 21:34:37) for a short session(#included next week) with the building in a partial lockdown(#included next week) .
The federal court case against Josh Frydenberg is the first eligibility challenge(#included October 2017) of the Australian parliament , after the Australian parliament was rocked(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) by 14 MPs or senators resigning(#included 2020-04-02) or being ruled(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) ineligible due to dual citizenship .
In October 2017 the federal court adopted(#included October 2017) a strict interpretation(#included October 2017) of the bar on foreign citizens , disqualifying(#included October 2017) then deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and four senators because then deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and four senators had failed(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) to renounce(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) dual citizenships before nominating(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) for the Australian parliament .
If Josh Frydenberg were disqualified(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) , on one reading of the constitution , Josh Frydenberg could continue(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) as treasurer from outside the Australian parliament for a period of three months .
Josh Frydenberg could renounce(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) Hungarian citizenship and seek(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) re - election at a byelection , following(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) Joyce and every other MP who lost their lower house seat in the 45th parliament only to return(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) with a fresh mandate .
According to Josh Frydenberg eligibility declaration , Frydenberg ’s maternal grandparents were born(#included October 2017) in Hungary , giving(#included October 2017) birth to Frydenberg ’s mother there in 1943 .
Nevertheless , Josh Frydenberg declared(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) Josh Frydenberg had never been the subject or citizen of any country other than Australia .
Josh Frydenberg ’s lawyers told(#included February) the federal court in February challenged should be thrown(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) out because the MP ’s mother , Erica Strauss , was rendered(#included October 2017) stateless after fleeing(#included October 2017) Hungary with the MP ’s mother , Erica Strauss family in 1949 .
“ A precondition to renounce(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) [ citizenship ] is establishing(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) to the satisfaction of the federal government that you are a citizen and in this case the federal government does not recognise(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) the respondent as a citizen , ” John Sheahan QC said(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) .
John Sheahan QC added(#included 19 November) there was a letter from the Hungarian prime minister ’s office on 19 November confirming(#included 19 November) Josh Frydenberg ’s Hungarian citizenship had not been established(#before 2020-03-16 21:34:37) .
