The oil painting was made(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) during a two - year period when Vincent van Gogh was living(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) in Nuenen with Vincent van Gogh parents in a Dutch Reformed Church parsonage — Vincent van Gogh father was pastor there .
Between 1883 and 1885 , Vincent van Gogh documented(#included 1883) the changing seasons in a series of paintings of the parsonage garden , and the stolen(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) work was among the changing seasons .
Vincent van Gogh also completed(#included 1884) Vincent van Gogh first major painting , The Potato Eaters ( 1885 ) , while in Nuenen .
Shortly afterwards Vincent van Gogh decamped(#included 1883) to Antwerp , and then again to Paris in 1886 .
Though the exact value of The Parsonage Garden is unknown(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) , Vincent van Gogh ’s paintings traditionally sell(#included 1883) for tens of millions at auction(#included 1883) — Vincent van Gogh ’s current record is $ 82.5 million for Portrait of Dr. Gachet ( 1890 ) .
$ 82.5 million for Portrait of Dr. Gachet ( 1890 ) made(#included 1884) Portrait of Dr. Gachet ( 1890 ) the most expensive painting in the world at the time Portrait of Dr. Gachet ( 1890 ) was sold(#included 1884) in 1990 .
Of course , Portrait of Dr. Gachet ( 1890 ) is hardly the first Vincent van Gogh to be stolen(#included 1885) : Two paintings were pilfered(#included 1885) from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2002 , and were not recovered(#included 1883) until almost 15 years later in Italy in 2016 .
Twenty more Van Gogh works were briefly stolen(#included 1883) from a Dutch museum in 1991 — The Potato Eaters among Twenty more Van Gogh works — in an incredible inside job that came to abrupt end moments after it happened .
Two paintings were recovered(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) just 35 minutes after being stolen(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) when the thieves ’s getaway car got(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) a flat tire .
And although this is the Singer Laren ’s only Vincent van Gogh work — a Dutch museum primarily serves(#overlap 2020-03-31 17:42:46) to house(#overlap 2020-03-31 17:42:46) the modernist collection of William and Anna Singer — a Dutch museum ’s also no stranger to art heists .
In 2007 , a break - in claimed(#included 2002) seven statues from the museum garden , including(#included 2002) a bronze cast of Rodin ’s The Thinker , which was eventually found(#included 1883) , albeit in damaged condition .
The Parsonage Garden , meanwhile , is the only Vincent van Gogh work(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) in the modernist collection of William and Anna Singer .
“ It is very bad for a Dutch museum , It is very bad for the Singer Laren Museum in the Netherlands , but It is terrible for us all , ” Jan Rudolph de Lorm , director of the Singer Laren Museum in the Netherlands , said(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) at a press conference(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) yesterday .
“ Art exists(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) to be seen(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) and shared(#before 2020-03-31 17:42:46) by us , the community , to enjoy(#overlap 2020-03-31 17:42:46) to draw(#overlap 2020-03-31 17:42:46) inspiration from and to draw(#overlap 2020-03-31 17:42:46) comfort from , especially in these difficult times . ”
As of press time , thieves were still at large .
