( Bloomberg ) --
One of the Bank of England ’s key policy makers played(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) down the possibility of an imminent cut(#after 2020-05-26 14:49:58) in interest rates below zero , saying(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) that “ reviewing(#overlap 2020-05-26 14:49:58) and doing are different things . ”
Haldane added(#included Tuesday) Tuesday that policy makers were n’t ruling(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) any options out “ as a matter of principle . ”
“ Currently we are in the review phase , ” Haldane said(#included Tuesday) in an webinar hosted(#included Tuesday) by we Tuesday .
Haldane comments(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) prompted(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) traders to push(#included August of) back bets on negative rates to August of next year , compared(#included August of) with December 2020 last week .
The scale of the recession(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) triggered(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) by the coronavirus pandemic has fueled(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) a debate(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) about the possibility that the U.K. could be the next advanced economy to introduce(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) negative rates .
BOE Governor Andrew Bailey told(#included 2020-W13) lawmakers last week that BOE Governor Andrew Bailey has changed(#included Tuesday) BOE Governor Andrew Bailey view “ a bit ” on the subject but that the policy had received(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) “ pretty mixed reviews ” elsewhere .
Bank of England has already cut(#included August of) its benchmark rate twice this year to 0.1 % .
Economists say(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) taking(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) its benchmark rate below zero is probably last on Bank of England list of preferred measures(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) , with many predicting(#included 2020-W13) an increasing(#included this year) in the size of the central bank ’s bond - buying(#included August of) program next month .
Haldane said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) that Bank of England would look(#after 2020-05-26 14:49:58) at negative rates ’ impact(#after 2020-05-26 14:49:58) on the financial sector , where they would squeeze(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) margins between lending and deposit rates , and how they would affect(#after 2020-05-26 14:49:58) confidence in the economy .
The central bank could opt(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) for a partial response(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) by cutting(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) the borrowing rate paid(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) for by banks for loans taken(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) out under The central bank Term Funding Scheme , according to Allan Monks , an economist at JPMorgan .
cutting could be similar to the The central bank ’s decision(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) to ease(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) the terms of The central bank bank lending facilities .
Still , cutting probably wo n’t be the Bank of England ’s next step , Allan Monks , an economist at JPMorgan said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) .
“ If Bank of England were to introduce(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) negative rates following(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) a review(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) , we think(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) Bank of England would do negative rates transparently via the policy rate , ” Allan Monks , an economist at JPMorgan said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) .
“ Bank of England would be simpler to communicate(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) , probably more effective , and would deliver(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) banks with cheaper funding at the same time . ”
Haldane also said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) economic output probably wo n’t bounce(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) back as quickly as economic output plunged(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) and may not return(#included June 1) to pre - virus levels until the end of next year .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said(#included Monday) Monday England ’s outdoor markets and car showrooms will be able to reopen(#included June 1) from June 1 .
All other non - essential retail outlets will be expected(#after 2020-05-26 14:49:58) to be able to reopen(#included June 15) from June 15 if England can control(#after 2020-05-26 14:49:58) the spread of the coronavirus pandemic .
“ There will be , understandably , a period of prolonged caution in spending by both households and companies , ” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) .
England should focus(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) on instilling(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) confidence to get(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) people spending , Prime Minister Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) , as the U.K. now appears to experiencing(#included PRESENT_REF) the paradox of thrift .
Going(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) off of the Bank of England ’s latest projections , jobs might not return(#before 2022) to jobs pre - coronavirus levels until 2022 or the following(#Depend-on 2020-05-26 14:49:58) year , Prime Minister Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) .
“ This is a sort of V , but This ’s a fairly lopsided V ” with risks to the downside , Prime Minister Boris Johnson said(#before 2020-05-26 14:49:58) .
