After a third inconclusive(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) election(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) in less than a year left(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still three seats short of forming(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a majority , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Netanyahu's rival Gantz to agree(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) to an “ emergency(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) government ” to fight(#after 2020-03-15 14:22:50) the coronavirus outbreak .
However , Netanyahu's rival Gantz has so far been cool to asked , suggesting(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Netanyahu's rival Gantz could still try(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) to form(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a minority government of Netanyahu's rival Gantz own , ousting(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Israel ’s longest - serving leader .
Speaking(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) at a meeting(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) with President Reuven Rivlin , who is holding discussions with parties on forming a new government , Joint List head Ayman Odeh said(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Joint List voters had said(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) “ an emphatic ‘ no ’ to a right - wing government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ” .
Joint List is now the third biggest party in the Israeli parliament , after achieving(#included March 2) a record showing(#included March 2) in the March 2 election(#included March 2) .
Joint List head Ayman Odeh called(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “ serial inciter(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) ” against Israel ’s Arab minority .
His coalition would not join(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a government led(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) by Netanyahu's rival Gantz , but could potentially provide(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) His coalition enough votes to govern(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) .
About a fifth of Israeli citizens are Arabs - Palestinian by heritage but Israeli by citizenship .
But no Israeli government has ever included(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) an Arab political party .
Netanyahu ’s Likud party denounced(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) any such plans : “ While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling(#overlap 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a global and national crisis(#overlap 2020-03-15 14:22:50) in the most responsible way , Netanyahu's rival Gantz is racing(#overlap 2020-03-15 14:22:50) to form(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a minority government depending(#overlap 2020-03-15 14:22:50) on supporters of terror , ” Netanyahu ’s Likud party said(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) on Twitter .
With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing(#included 2020-04-07) criminal charges in three corruption cases - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trial(#included 2020-04-07) was supposed(#included March 2) to start(#included March 2) on Tuesday but was postponed(#before May 24) until May 24 amid the health crisis(#included March 2) - political rivals have cast(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) doubt on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu motives for proposing(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a unity cabinet .
Netanyahu's rival Gantz has said(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not appear(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) to be sincere , having yet to send(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a negotiating team to Gantz ’s Blue and White party .
“ When you ’re serious , we ’ll talk(#after 2020-03-15 14:22:50) , ” Netanyahu's rival Gantz wrote(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) .
Netanyahu's rival Gantz ’s prospect of toppling(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could depend(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) on former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman , who heads the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party .
former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman , who heads the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party has balked(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) at supporting(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) a government backed(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) by Arab legislators , accusing(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) Arab legislators of disloyalty to Israel .
But former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman , who heads the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party has also called(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to leave(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) power while under indictment .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) the pledged(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) backing of 58 members of the Israeli parliament , three short of a ruling(#overlap 2020-03-15 14:22:50) majority in the 120 - seat Knesset .
former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman , who heads the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party has denied(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) any wrongdoing(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) in the investigations(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) .
Charges against former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman , who heads the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party include(#before 2020-03-15 14:22:50) bribery , breach of trust and fraud .
