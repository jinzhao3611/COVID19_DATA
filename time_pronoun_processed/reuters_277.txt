A Russian high - level source told(#included Friday) Reuters on Friday that Russia would not back(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) an OPEC call(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) for extra reductions(#after July 2017) in oil output and would agree(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) only to an extension of existing(#Depend-on 2020-03-06 14:57:57) cuts(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) by OPEC and its allies , a group known as OPEC+ .
“ What counts(#overlap 2020-03-06 14:57:57) really is what Saudi Arabia does .
If Russia joined(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) , Saudi Arabia will not add(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) substantially .
We need(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) to see(#after 2020-03-06 14:57:57) if OPEC goes(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) ahead all alone , ” said(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) Olivier Jakob , of the Petromatrix consultancy .
One Middle East source said(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) that OPEC had(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) no intention of pursuing(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) deeper cuts(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) without Russia .
OPEC is pushing(#overlap 2020-03-06 14:57:57) for an additional 1.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of cuts until the end of 2020 .
Sources at OPEC confirmed(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) Russia ’s position and a formal OPEC+ meeting was under way after hours of delay(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) .
An its allies , a group known as OPEC+ delegate said(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) there were “ positive signs ” after a separate , earlier its allies , a group known as OPEC+ meeting(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) had finished(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) .
Non - OPEC states were expected(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) to contribute(#after 2020-03-06 14:57:57) 500,000 bpd to an additional 1.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of cuts , OPEC ministers said(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) .
the proposal would have meant its allies , a group known as OPEC+ production(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) curbs amounting(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) to a total of 3.6 million bpd , or about 3.6 % of global supply .
“ Our balances suggest(#overlap 2020-03-06 14:57:57) that at least 2 million bpd needs(#Depend-on 2020-03-06 14:57:57) to be removed(#after 2020-03-06 14:57:57) from the market during Q2 to ensure(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) a stabilisation(#after 2020-03-06 14:57:57) in oil prices , ” said(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) Bjoernar Tonhaugen , head of oil markets at Rystad Energy .
“ If this results(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) in OPEC not going(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) through with OPEC own proposed(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) 1 million bpd cuts(#after 2020-03-06 14:57:57) in Q2 , the result ... could be devastating(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) .
Brent could swiftly drop(#before 2020-03-06 14:57:57) 15 % to the low $ 40s and WTI to the high $ 30s in this scenario . ”
