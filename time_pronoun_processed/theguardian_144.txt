Author of Guardian article on death tolls asks(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) UK government to stop(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) using(#overlap 2020-05-06 19:49:17) death tolls .

A statistician has asked(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) UK government to stop(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) using(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) an article he wrote for the Guardian as justification for why UK government ’s death toll from coronavirus should not be compared(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) with that of other countries .
Prof David Spiegelhalter said(#included 30 April) in the piece published(#included 30 April) on 30 April that comparing(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) the number of deaths(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) from Covid-19 between countries was difficult because of the different methodologies used(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) by governments to measure(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) deaths(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) .
an article he wrote for the Guardian points(#included 30 April) out that even though UK government had begun(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) including(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) coronavirus deaths(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) in non - hospital settings , the total toll was still probably too low as the total toll did not include(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) the many deaths(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) of people who had not been tested(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) .
Prof David Spiegelhalter notes(#overlap 2020-05-06 19:49:17) other countries also use(#overlap 2020-05-06 19:49:17) different methodologies , such as Spain where deaths(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) in care homes are not included(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) .
The day an article he wrote for the Guardian was published(#included 2020-04-01) , England ’s chief medical officer , Prof Chris Whitty , praised(#included 2020-04-01) an article he wrote for the Guardian during the No 10 daily coronavirus briefing(#included 30 April) , saying(#included 2020-04-01) an article he wrote for the Guardian showed(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) that comparing(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) death rates in different countries was a “ fruitless exercise(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) ” .
Boris Johnson again referred(#included 2020-04-01) to Prof David Spiegelhalter ’s words on Wednesday in a response(#included 2020-04-01) to the Labour leader , Keir Starmer , during prime minister ’s questions , after UK government ’s death(#included 2020-04-01) toll became(#included 2020-04-01) the highest in Europe and second highest globally .
According to latest official figures , at least 30,150 people have died(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) from the virus in UK government .
the Labour leader , Keir Starmer , said(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) the Labour leader , Keir Starmer “ is right to draw(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) attention to the appalling statistics not just in UK government and
but of course around the world .
I would echo(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) what England ’s heard(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) from Prof David Spiegelhalter and others that at this stage , I do n’t think(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) that international comparisons and the data is yet there to draw(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) all the conclusions that we want(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) .
“ There will be a time to look(#after 2020-05-06 19:49:17) at what decisions we took(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) and whether we could have taken(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) different decisions . ”
However , a few hours later Prof David Spiegelhalter , tweeted(#included 30 April) : “ Polite request(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) to PM and others : please stop(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) using(#overlap 2020-05-06 19:49:17) an article he wrote for the Guardian to claim(#overlap 2020-05-06 19:49:17) PM and others can not make(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) any international comparisons yet .
Prof David Spiegelhalter refer(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) only to detailed(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) league tables - of course we should now use(#included now) other countries to try(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) and learn(#before 2020-05-06 19:49:17) why we numbers are high ” .
Prof David Spiegelhalter is the Winton professor of public understanding of risk at Cambridge University .
