LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The amount of gold stored(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) in vaults in New York registered(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) by CME Group ’s Comex exchange has risen(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) by nearly 2 million ounces , CME Group data showed(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) , proving(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) ample to settle(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) monthly contract obligations(#included monthly) and easing(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) concerns of shortages that sent(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) prices skyrocketing(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) .

Traders worried(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) it would be impossible to fly(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) gold from London to deliver(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) against Comex contracts after coronavirus lockdown(#included 2020-03) measures(#included 2020-03) grounded(#included 2020-03) planes and shut(#included 2020-03) several precious metals refineries last month .
On March 23 , just before gold traded(#included 2020-03-23) in New York jumped(#included 2020-03-23) as much as $ 70 , or 4 % above London spot prices , contracts representing(#included 2020-04) almost 20 million ounces for delivery(#included 2020-04) in April were open on Comex , with less than 9 million ounces in store .
But the price premium triggered(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) a rush to transfer(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) gold to New York .
Total stocks in Comex - registered(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) vaults increased(#included 2020-03-26) by 1.75 million ounces , or 54 tonnes , from March 26 to a four - year high of 10.5 million ounces , while the proportion put(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) on warrant , or made(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) available for delivery , doubled(#included 2020-03-26) to around 40 % .

Meanwhile , most investors rolled(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) most investors positions to contracts with future delivery(#after 2020-04-03 15:51:17) dates , reducing(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) the amount of gold needed(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) for settlement .
24,489 contracts equivalent(#included 2020-04) to 2.4 million ounces for April delivery(#included 2020-04) have been redeemed(#included 2020-04) for metal , the highest monthly total since at least 2011 , CME Group data show(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) .
Investors typically use(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) Comex to gain(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) exposure to gold prices and rarely ask(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) to take(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) metal , which costs money to store(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) .
For gain , far less gold is stored(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) in New York than trades(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) there .
If gold is needed(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) , gold can be quickly flown(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) on passenger planes from London via Swiss refiners that melt(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) and reshape(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) gold to meet(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) Comex specifications .
The next active monthly future on Comex is for June delivery(#included 2020-06) , with 359,803 contracts active representing(#included 2020-04) 36 million ounces .
Comex price is around $ 25 above London spot gold , suggesting(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) that worries(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) remain(#overlap 2020-04-03 15:51:17) .
“ There ’s still some logistical concerns in the market about not having(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) the right bars in the right place , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen .

But Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen said(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) the price gap would shrink(#after 2020-04-03 15:51:17) as refineries reopened(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) and CME Group launched(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) a new gold contract that can be settled(#after 2020-04-03 15:51:17) using(#after 2020-04-03 15:51:17) London standard 400 - ounce bars as well the 100 ounce bars CME Group currently takes(#included PRESENT_REF) .
The London Bullion Market Association , which oversees London trading , said(#included 2020-W13) last week The London Bullion Market Association , which oversees London trading , was working(#included 2020-W13) with refiners , shippers and banks to move(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) metal , including(#before 2020-04-03 15:51:17) by cargo and charter planes .
