The biggest breakdown(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) yet of novel coronavirus cases suggests(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) that 80% are mild. Some patients don't show(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) symptoms at all. .
2020-02-20 04:28:22 +00:00 .
Patients infected(#included February 17 , 2020) with the coronavirus rest at a temporary hospital in the Wuhan Sports Center in central China 's Hubei Province , February 17 , 2020 .
The death(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) toll from the coronavirus crossed(#included this week) 2,000 this week .
But new research suggests(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) that most cases of the coronavirus are mild .
A new report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed(#included February 17 , 2020) records of all of China reported(#included February 17 , 2020) cases of the coronavirus from December 8 to February 11 — a total of 72,314 patients .
( For the latest case total and death(#included December 8) toll(#included December 8) , see Business Insider 's live updates(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) . )
the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) that 80.9 % of the confirmed cases were mild .
80.9 % of the confirmed cases might experience(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) a fever or dry cough , but 80.9 % of the confirmed cases are n't likely to have(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) difficulty breathing(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) or develop(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) a severe lung infection .
A new report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also found(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) that infected people can show(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) no symptoms at all — show was the case for 1.2 % of the patients involved .
A far higher portion of asymptomatic cases , meanwhile , has been found(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship .
the Diamond Princess cruise ship has been host to the largest number of diagnosed(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) COVID-19 cases outside China : at least 621 .
But 322 of those patients showed(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) no symptoms , according to Japan 's Ministry of Health .
It 's possible that 322 of those patients could develop(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) symptoms later , but 322 of those patients also offer(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) evidence that many coronavirus carriers in China might be going(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) undetected , since many coronavirus carriers in China probably would n't visit(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) a doctor without experiencing(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) symptoms .
( Researchers still are n't sure(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) whether people can spread(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) the coronavirus when people have(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) no symptoms . )
Health officials have suspected(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) this for weeks .
" There 's another whole cohort that is either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic , " Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said(#included early February) at a briefing(#included early February) in early February .
" the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 're going(#after 2020-02-20 04:28:22) to see(#after 2020-02-20 04:28:22) a diminution in the overall death rate . "
Of the patients in A new report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , only 2,087 — 2.3 % of all cases — developed(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) severe symptoms like respiratory failure , septic shock , or organ failure .
All of the deaths(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) came(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) from another whole cohort that is either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic .
" In severe cases , you basically flood(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) your lungs and you ca n't breathe(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) , " Dr. Matthew Frieman , an associate professor who researchers coronaviruses at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , told(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) National Geographic .
" severe cases 's how people are dying(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) . "
Overall , however , the COVID-19 fatality rate is far lower than that of past coronavirus epidemics(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) .
Based(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) on the ratio of deaths(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) to confirmed(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) cases so far , it appears(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) to be around 2 % .
Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , by contrast , killed(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) 9.6 % of those infected(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) , and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) killed(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) 34.4 % of cases .
Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and other experts , however , think(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) it 's likely that fatality(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) rate will drop(#after 2020-02-20 04:28:22) as more mild cases are counted(#after 2020-02-20 04:28:22) .
Researchers have also found(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) evidence that some patients have(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) less typical symptoms , like gastrointestinal issues , that can mislead(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) medical workers .
" Dr. Matthew Frieman , an associate professor who researchers coronaviruses at the University of Maryland School of Medicine guess is there 's a delay(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) in a lot of the reporting(#included February 17 , 2020) , " Dr. Matthew Frieman , an associate professor who researchers coronaviruses at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , previously told(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) Business Insider 's .
" If people are sick(#overlap 2020-02-20 04:28:22) and people 're not getting(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) tested(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) , then Johns Hopkins University do n't know(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) about people . "
On Tuesday , officials in China 's Hubei province , where the virus originated , announced(#included Tuesday) officials in China 's Hubei province , where the virus originated , would track(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) and investigate(#included February 17 , 2020) people who purchased(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) fever and cough medicine in an attempt(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) to find(#before 2020-02-20 04:28:22) unreported cases of the coronavirus .
