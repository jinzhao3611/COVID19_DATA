Tui has offered(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) affected customers a 20 % incentive in the hope of persuading(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) affected customers to rebook(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) another trip(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) rather than to take(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) a full refund as required(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) by law .
Back in March the government advised(#included March) against all non - essential journeys(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) , which stopped(#included March) all foreign travel in all foreign travel tracks .
There has been no indication on when advised might be eased(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) and home secretary Priti Patel announced(#included March) last week that all travellers arriving(#included 12 June) in the UK , including(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) the UK residents , would face(#included the autumn) a mandatory 14 - day quarantine(#included 12 June) from 8 June .
eased has drawn(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) substantial criticism(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) from airlines .
On Thursday the bosses of 70 travel firms wrote(#included March) a joint letter to home secretary Priti Patel calling(#included March) on home secretary Priti Patel to scrap(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) the quarantine(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) period , which the bosses of 70 travel firms argue(#overlap 2020-05-28 17:34:34) will halt(#after 2020-05-28 17:34:34) future bookings(#after 2020-05-28 17:34:34) .
“ The very last thing the travel industry needs(#overlap 2020-05-28 17:34:34) is a mandatory quarantine(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) imposed(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) on all arriving(#overlap 2020-05-28 17:34:34) passengers , which will deter(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) foreign visitors from coming(#overlap 2020-05-28 17:34:34) here , deter(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) the UK visitors from travelling(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) abroad and , most likely , cause(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) other countries to impose(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) reciprocal quarantine requirements on British visitors , ” it said .
last week the Competition and Markets Authority said(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) the Competition and Markets Authority was investigating(#included March) package holiday firms after receiving(#included March) thousands of complaints(#included March) from consumers who have been unable to recoup(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) money on cancelled(#before 2020-05-28 17:34:34) breaks .
