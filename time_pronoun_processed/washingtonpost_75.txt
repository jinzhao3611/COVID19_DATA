“ MedStar employee called(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) MedStar employee in and said(#included the) , ‘ MedStar employee want(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) MedStar employee to remove(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) the posts , this is hurting(#overlap 2020-05-19 23:53:20) MedStar ’s brand , ’ ”
Cusick ’s attorney , Lynne Bernabei , told(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) The Washington Post .
“ Essentially this is a whistleblower ’s claim . ”
So Young Pak , the hospital ’s director of media relations , told(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) The Washington Post the facility has not yet been served(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) with lawsuit and “ thus can not offer(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) any comment . ”
Cusick began(#included January 2018) working(#included January 2018) at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center in January 2018 .
According to her legal complaint , Young Pak , the hospital ’s director of media relations was a hearing - and - speech assistant and Young Pak , the hospital ’s director of media relations job entailed(#included January 2018) conducting(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) newborn hearing screenings and assisting(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) on speech language pathology diagnostics , as well as administrative duties .
The heart of her legal complaint stems(#overlap 2020-05-19 23:53:20) from what Young Pak , the hospital ’s director of media relations claims(#overlap 2020-05-19 23:53:20) was a failure of the hospital ’s administrators to properly screen(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) patients and others for covid-19 symptoms at the entrances to the facility .
For example , by March 13 , the MedStar Washington Hospital Center had still not implemented(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) any procedures for screening(#included March 13) patients , visitors or members of the public upon entrance to the MedStar Washington Hospital Center , in clear violation of CDC recommendations(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) , ” lawsuit alleges(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) .
Cusick claimed(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) Cusick made(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) Cusick concerns known to Cusick higher - ups .
But after a new protocol was introduced(#included March 16) for screening(#included March 16) people entering(#included March 16) the facility on March 16 , Cusick alleged(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) the guidelines were ignored(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) .
Cusick also said(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) Cusick observed(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) as social distancing(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) measures(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) were not being enforced(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) in the hospital ’s cafeteria .
The situation prompted(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) Cusick to reach(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) for Cusick phone and tag the MedStar Washington Hospital Center in a Twitter post .
“ @MedStarWHC can we please follow(#overlap 2020-05-19 23:53:20) @_DCHealth guidelines for eating in common areas ? , ” Cusick wrote(#included March 16) on March 16 under a video she posted of the busy cafeteria , according to images provided(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) to The Washington Post .
A day later , Cusick again brought(#included March 16) the issue up on Twitter , this time tagging(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) the District ’s mayor .
“ @MayorBowser why are cafeterias like this inside the hospitals not being held(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) to the same standards as other public cafeterias / mass gatherings ?
, ” Cusick wrote(#included March 13) on March 17 , according to an image .
“ Please help(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) protect(#included currently) our healthcare workers and the public @MedStarWHC currently has(#included currently) an open door policy , this is a public access cafeteria . ”
With screening still allegedly not going(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) on at the hospital ’s entrances , on March 17 Cusick recorded(#included March 18) an interview(#included March 18) on Cusick phone with an unidentified security guard who acknowledged(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) individuals walking(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) through the entrances were not being checked(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) at the security desk .
Cusick uploaded(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) a video she posted of the busy cafeteria .
“ Cusick am posting(#overlap 2020-05-19 23:53:20) a video she posted of the busy cafeteria because Cusick care(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) for our patient safety , ” Cusick wrote(#included currently) later .
“ Cusick have spoken(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) to my superiors during our briefing and advocated(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) for multiple precautionary measures that are recommended(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) by CDC , WHO , and @MayorBowser and have not seen(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) action on the ‘ frontlines . ’ ”
According to her legal complaint , Cusick was called(#included March 18) into a conference(#included A day later) room that same day , where members of management told(#included A day later) Cusick Cusick had violated(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) “ Cusick social media contract and had violated(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) patient and employee rights ” under HIPPA .
“ members of management further stated(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) , tellingly , that it was inappropriate for Cusick to post(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) things like this to social media because social media made(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) MedStar ’s ‘ brand ’ look bad . ”
In tears , Cusick agreed(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) to delete(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) the tweets and maintained(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) “ Cusick had consistently voiced(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) Cusick concerns ” to my superiors “ to no avail , ” according to lawsuit .
Social media was a last resort to get(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) management ’s attention , Cusick claimed(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) .
After our briefing , Cusick was forced(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) to turn(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) over Cusick hospital identification badge , and all Cusick subsequent work shifts were canceled(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) , lawsuit claimed(#before 2020-05-19 23:53:20) .
