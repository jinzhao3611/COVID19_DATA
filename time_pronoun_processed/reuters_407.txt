By Vladimir Soldatkin and Agnieszka Barteczko MOSCOW / WARSAW , May 15 ( Reuters ) - A gas transit deal between Russia and Poland that expires later this month will not be renewed(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) , Russia ’s Gazprom said(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) , as Warsaw aligns Warsaw energy regulations with European Union rules and curbs Warsaw decades - old dependence on Russian fuel .
Tensions between Russia and Poland over gas imports are part of wider political strain between Russia and the West , since Russia ’s annexation(#included 2014) of Crimea from gas - producing Ukraine in 2014 .
Warsaw has repeatedly said(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) Warsaw will not buy(#after 2020-05-15 12:55:36) any Russian gas after 2022 , when another long - term supply deal will end(#after 2020-05-15 12:55:36) .
Instead , Warsaw will take(#after 2020-05-15 12:55:36) pipeline deliveries from Norway and buy(#after 2020-05-15 12:55:36) sea - borne cargoes of liquefied(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) natural gas , including(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) from the United States .
“ Effectively , A gas transit deal between Russia and Poland that expires later this month is over , ” Gazprom ’s spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) Reuters .
Gazprom ’s spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) gas would still transit(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) through Poland , but did not go(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) into detail about whether transit fees might rise(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) .
Poland has long complained(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) transit fees are too low .
Poland ’s transit deal , which dates(#included the 1990s) back to the 1990s , is tied(#included the 1990s) to the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany .
the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany has(#included May) annual capacity of 33 billion cubic metres ( bcm ) .
After A gas transit deal between Russia and Poland that expires later this month expires(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) , Russia ’s Gazprom can book(#after 2020-05-15 12:55:36) short - term transit capacity with Gaz - System , the operator of Polish pipeline system .
Gaz - System , the operator of Polish pipeline system told(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) Reuters short - term transit capacity will be available through an auction on May 17 .
an auction on May 17 was held(#included May 4) on May 4 .
“ The system users booked(#included July 1) a significant ( around 80 % ) capacity at the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany for the quarter starting(#included July 1) on July 1 , ” Gaz - System , the operator of Polish pipeline system said(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) without revealing(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) The system users .
Russia ’s Gazprom declined(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) to comment(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) on an auction on May 17 .
TRANSIT CAPACITY SURPLUS
In theory , Russia will have(#after 2020-05-15 12:55:36) access to surplus transit capacity following(#included early next year) the completion(#included early next year) of the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany expected(#included early next year) early next year , although construction(#included PRESENT_REF) is suspended(#included PRESENT_REF) for now because of U.S. sanctions(#included May) .
the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany has for years divided(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) opinion in European Union , as Germany argued(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) there was a strong business case , while other nations said(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany was political and breached(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) European Union rules on pipeline access .
On Friday , Germany ’s energy regulator declined(#included July 1) to grant(#included July 1) a waiver(#included July 1) of European Union gas directives to the operators of the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas from the northern Yamal peninsula to Poland and on to Germany .
Nord Stream-2 also faces(#overlap 2020-05-15 12:55:36) the problem of a collapse(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) in energy demand because of the impact(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) of the novel coronavirus .
Russia ’s Gazprom ’s exports to Europe this year are expected(#included early next year) to drop(#included early next year) to 167 bcm from 199 bcm in 2019 .
Poland ’s gas demand is about 17 bcm a year , with more than half provided(#before 2020-05-15 12:55:36) by Russia under the long - term Russia ’s Gazprom contract .
For futures supplies , Poland is expanding(#overlap 2020-05-15 12:55:36) , an LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on Poland Baltic coast .
Poland is also constructing(#overlap 2020-05-15 12:55:36) a pipeline to Norway .
