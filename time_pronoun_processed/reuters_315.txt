The owner of the Intercontinental Shanghai Wonderland , a hotel built on the site of a former quarry has been highlighted(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) by analysts as among the European companies most directly exposed(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) to the coronavirus outbreak .

Based(#overlap 2020-02-18 14:27:50) on current disruption(#included now) an impact on bookings equates(#included now) to about $ 5 million a month for IHG ’s mainland China business , Chief Executive Keith Barr said(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) on an analysts call(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) , describing(#included Tuesday) declined as “ a short - term blip(#included Tuesday) ” .

Nassetta said(#included last month) this month .
One yardstick(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) for the impact(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) of the crisis(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) on Rival Hilton Worldwide is the previous SARS outbreak(#before 2020-02-18 14:27:50) , which cut(#before 2020-02-18) Holiday Inn owner IHG ’s RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region by 27 % in the three months to June 2003 .
