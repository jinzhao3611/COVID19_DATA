Coronavirus UK lockdown causes(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) big drop in air pollution .
2020-03-27 09:42:17 +00:00 .
The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak has led(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) to big drops in air pollution across UK ’s major cities , new data analysis shows(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
Levels of toxic pollutants are likely to fall(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) even further , scientists said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) , as traffic remains(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) off the roads but prevailing(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) westerly winds from the Atlantic return(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
Current easterly winds are bringing(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) additional pollution(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) from continental Europe to Britain .
new data analysis shows(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) drops in tiny particle pollution of a third to a half in London , Birmingham , Bristol and Cardiff , falls of about quarter in Manchester , York and Belfast , with smaller declines(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) in Glasgow and Newcastle .
For nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) pollution , new data analysis also shows(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) declines(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) of a third to a half in London , Birmingham , Bristol and Cardiff , and drops of 10 - 20 % in the other cities .
Air quality improvements(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) have been seen(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) in nations around the world from Italy to China , as much transport and industry has(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) ground to a halt(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
Public health experts have warned(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) that the health damage(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) inflicted(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) on people by longstanding air pollution is likely to increase(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) the death(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) rate from Covid-19 .
“ The air is definitely much healthier , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) Prof James Lee at York University and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science , who analysed the data .
“ [ Tiny particles and NO2 ] are the two air pollutants that have(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) the biggest health impacts on people . ”
“ Tiny particles and NO2 ] are big changes – pollution levels are the equivalent at the moment of a holiday , say(#included Easter Sunday) an Easter Sunday , ” Prof James Lee at York University and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science , who analysed the data said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
“ And Prof James Lee at York University and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science , who analysed the data think(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) we will see(#after 2020-03-27 09:42:17) an even starker drop(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) off when the weather changes(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) . ”
new data analysis comes(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) from background air monitoring stations in cities , sited away from main roads .
“ We chose(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) background air monitoring stations in cities , sited away from main roads because background air monitoring stations in cities , sited away from main roads is where people live(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) Prof James Lee at York University .
The average pollution levels for the six - week period before the onset(#included the 10 February) of coronavirus outbreak(#included the 10 February) around the 10 February were compared(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) with the six weeks after .
Prof James Lee at York University also compared(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) the six - week period with the average of the same period over the last five years .
Both comparisons(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) showed(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) large cuts in pollution .
new data analysis is preliminary(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) as full calibration(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) of new data analysis takes(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) time , but Prof James Lee at York University said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) it was very clear there had been a significant fall(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) in pollution .
The biggest factor is the reduction(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) in road traffic , as other contributors such as gas power station operations , heating for buildings and emissions from farms are unlikely to have changed(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) overall .
One pollutant – ozone – has risen(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
risen is because chemical interactions in the air normally result(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) in NO2 and small particles reducing(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) ozone levels .
So as they have fallen(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) , ozone has risen(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
But Prof James Lee at York University said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) : “ The ozone increases(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) are small , and it usually does n’t become(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) a problem until the summer months anyway . ”
Some scientists have suggested(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) that the number of early deaths(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) avoided(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) due to cleaner air might potentially outnumber(#after 2020-03-27 09:42:17) the deaths(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) from coronavirus .
“ The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak is going(#after 2020-03-27 09:42:17) to be a very interesting epidemiological study , but they take(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) years to do , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) Prof James Lee at York University .
Prof James Lee at York University said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) analysis(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) would be difficult because the health impact of coronavirus was fast , while that of air pollution was slower , and because older people were most at risk from both factors .
“ There is no silver lining to the Covid-19 situation , ” Prof James Lee at York University said(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
“ But Prof James Lee at York University think(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak shows(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) we can actually achieve(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) quite a lot without travelling(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) .
The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak shows(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) that if we did work(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) from home more in normal times then we would have(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) an effect on air pollution . ”
Levels of NO2 in most urban areas of UK have been illegally high(#after 2010) since 2010 and many areas have(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:42:17) levels of small particles above the limit recommended(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) by the World Health Organization .
air pollution is estimated(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) to cause(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) about 110 premature deaths(#before 2020-03-27 09:42:17) every day .
