( Bloomberg ) --
Indian companies struggling(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) against the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) and a domestic credit crunch are facing(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) another obstacle : competition from state governments to sell(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) debt .
States in Asia ’s third - biggest economy are planning(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) to crank(#included this quarter) up bond sales(#included this quarter) by 18.2 % this quarter from a year earlier to make(#included this quarter) up for a decline(#included this quarter) in tax revenue due to an economic slowdown(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) .
States in Asia ’s third - biggest economy usually have(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) lower credit risks than companies , and are offering(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) higher yields than before , which could entice(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) investors .
The corporate bond market was already suffering(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) , prompting(#included Friday) the central bank Friday to again inject(#included Friday) more money into The corporate bond market .
“ Demand for longer tenor corporate bonds from insurers and pension funds is expected(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) to fall(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) as Demand for longer tenor corporate bonds from insurers and pension funds shift(#included PRESENT_REF) allocations to state bonds after the recent surge(#included recent) in yields , ” said(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) Manoj Jaju , chief investment officer at
Bharti AXA General Insurance Co.
“ We too will have(#included PRESENT_REF) a bias toward state bonds over corporate debt now . ”
India is n’t alone in seeing(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) massive bond sales(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) by governments as authorities across the world come(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) up with stimulus steps .
Weakening(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) demand for company debt in India will put(#after 2020-04-19 23:35:16) added(#after 2020-04-19 23:35:16) pressure on borrowers already suffering(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) from the world ’s biggest lockdown(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) , a probable recession(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) and a credit crunch that started(#included 2018) in 2018 .
It also risks(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) diluting(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) the impact(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) of the central bank ’s approximately $ 50 billion unconventional cash steps to support(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) the credit market .
The Reserve Bank of India on Friday said(#included Friday) The Reserve Bank of India will inject(#included Friday) 500 billion rupees ( $ 6.5 billion ) into the corporate bond market in a new round of targeted(#included Friday) long - term repo operations(#after 2020-04-19 23:35:16) .
At least half of the funds made(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) available to banks through the facility should go(#after 2020-04-19 23:35:16) to lower - rated firms , including(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) shadow lenders and micro - financial institutions .
Yields on corporate bonds slid(#included Friday) sharply after stimulus steps .
But recent cases show(#included recent) how state debt may be more appealing than company securities , even with the extra policy support .
Maharashtra state , home to Mumbai , is a case in point .
Maharashtra state , home to Mumbai , auctioned(#included April 7) 10 - year debt on April 7 with an annualized(#included April 7) yield of 7.98 % , the highest for that tenor since January last year .
The latest rate was 44 basis points more than the yield on similar maturity AAA corporate notes .
On the same day , REC Ltd. , a state - owned financial firm , scrapped(#included 2020-04-25) plans to sell(#included 2018) notes because market participants demanded(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) higher yields .
State bonds are also attractive because State bonds have(#included recent) better trading(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) liquidity in the secondary market compared(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) with corporate securities , said(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) Jaju at Bharti AXA .
The state notes are accepted(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) as collateral at the central bank ’s repurchase auctions(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) , unlike corporate bonds , providing(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) an added incentive for investors , Jaju at Bharti AXA said(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) .
At the same time , the higher yields on state bonds are a reflection(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) of The state notes budget difficulties .
States ’ spending requirements are likely to shoot(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) up this financial year on account of Covid-19 , especially in health and welfare , according to a report(#before 2020-04-19 23:35:16) from ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.
As tax revenues fall(#included recently) , though , the trend toward more bond issuance seems(#overlap 2020-04-19 23:35:16) certain at any rate .
Other states have also sold(#included recently) securities with high yields recently .
Maharashtra state , home to Mumbai offered(#included April 7) 10 - year notes on April 7 at an annualized(#included March 30) yield of 8.07 % , while West Bengal issued(#included March 30) 2030 bonds on March 30 at 7.49 % .
