the coronavirus outbreak is " beginning(#overlap 2020-04-13 21:03:31) to steady(#Depend-on 2020-04-13 21:03:31) ... hope is returning(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) , " Macron said(#included Monday) , acknowledging(#included May 11) France was " obviously not sufficiently prepared " when France first cases were reported(#included last February) last February .
" France lacked(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) gowns , gloves , gel and France were not able to hand(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) out as many masks as France would have liked(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) , " Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) .

" For the most exposed workers and in certain situations such as public transport , the most exposed workers use could become(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) systematic , " Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) .
" May 11 will be the start(#included May 11) of a new phase .
a new phase will be progressive and the rules can be adapted(#after 2020-04-13 21:03:31) according to France results , " Macron said(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) .
Testing(#after 2020-04-13 21:03:31) capacities will be ramped(#after 2020-04-13 21:03:31) up as well so that anyone showing(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) symptoms can be diagnosed(#after 2020-04-13 21:03:31) , with those testing(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) positive placed(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) in quarantine(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) -- a measure(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) doctors have urged(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) as a key method for containing(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) the coronavirus outbreak .
the government will also work(#after 2020-04-13 21:03:31) on developing(#after 2020-04-13 21:03:31) an app for phones that could identify(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) people who had come(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) into contact(#before 2020-04-13 21:03:31) with an infected person .
