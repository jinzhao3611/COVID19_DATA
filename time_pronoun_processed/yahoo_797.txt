If things get(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) super bad , run ’s a possibility(#overlap 2020-04-08 21:07:08) .
Compared to many other travel companies , Booking Holdings was in relatively good shape before the coronavirus pandemic turned(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) the world into a lockdown(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) pandemic(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) , but Booking Holdings made(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) a series of disclosures about dire scenarios that are chilling(#overlap 2020-04-08 21:07:08) .

When excluding(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) the announced(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) external financing(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) and potential access to a $ 2 billion revolving credit line , Booking Holdings believes(#overlap 2020-04-08 21:07:08) ( Booking Holdings emphasis ) if business conditions worsen(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) Booking Holdings has(#included 2021) enough liquidity to last(#included 2021) only through the second half of 2021 .
But Booking Holdings added(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) : “ Booking Holdings can not , however , assure(#overlap 2020-04-08 21:07:08) you that this will be the case . ”
Booking Holdings explained(#included late March) that in late March Moody ’s retained(#included late March) Booking ’s A3 senior unsecured debt rating , but downgraded(#included late March) the outlook to “ negative . ”
Previously Booking ’s A3 senior unsecured debt rating was “ stable . ”
Booking(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) noted(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) that numerous factors could make(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) borrowing much more difficult in the future .

Booking Holdings will likely record(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) a “ significant ” impairment(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) charge , mostly tied(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) to a carrying value of $ 2.1 billion goodwill for Booking Holdings Kayak and OpenTable units when Booking Holdings reports(#included first quarter) its first quarter results .

Booking Holdings expects(#overlap 2020-04-08 21:07:08) coronavirus “ to have(#after 2020-04-08 21:07:08) a significant adverse impact on our business for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery , which could be an extensive period of time . ”
Booking ’s previously disclosed(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) risk factors , published(#included February 26) in Booking ’s annual report(#included February 26) February 26 , could get(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) riskier .
Many of those risk factors could be heightened(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) , Booking Holdings said(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) , especially as Booking Holdings relates(#overlap 2020-04-08 21:07:08) to the company ’s outstanding debt .
Booking Holdings somber warnings(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) came(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) in the context of announcing(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) senior notes offerings(#before 2020-04-08 21:07:08) , including(#included the second half of) one for $ 750 million in principal for convertible senior notes that come(#included 2025) due in 2025 .
