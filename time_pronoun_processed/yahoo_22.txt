Zoom will enable(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) waiting rooms by default to stop(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) Zoombombing .
2020-04-03 21:43:06 +00:00 .
Zoom is making(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) some drastic changes to prevent(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) rampant abuse(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) as trolls attack(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) publicly - shared video calls(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) .
Starting(#included 2020-04-05) April 5th , Zoom will require(#included 2020-04-05) passwords to enter(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) calls(#included 2020-04-05) via Meeting ID , since passwords may be guessed(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) or reused(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) .
Meanwhile , Zoom will change(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) virtual waiting(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) rooms to be on by default so hosts have to manually admit(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) attendees .
change could prevent(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) " Zoombombing " , a term I coined(#included 2020-W12) two weeks ago to describe(#included 2020-W12) malicious actors entering Zoom calls and disrupting(#included 2020-W12) malicious actors entering Zoom calls by screensharing(#included 2020-04-05) offensive imagery .
New Zoombombing tactics have since emerged(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) , like spamming(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) the chat thread with terrible GIFs , using(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) virtual backgrounds to spread(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) hateful messages , or just screaming(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) profanities and slurs .
Just imagine(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) the most frightened look on all these people 's faces .
the most frightened look on all these people 's faces 's what happened(#included 2020-W12) when Zoombombing attacked(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) the call .
The FBI has issued(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) a warning about the Zoombombing problem after children 's online classes , alcoholics anonymous meetings , and private business calls(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) were invaded(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) by trolls .
Security researchers have revealed(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) many ways that attackers can infiltrate(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) a call(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) .
the Zoombombing problem stem(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) from Zoom being designed(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) for trusted enterprise use cases rather than cocktail hours , yoga classes(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) , roundtable discussions(#included 2020-04-05) , and classes(#included 2020-04-05) .
But with Zoom struggling(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to scale(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) Zoom infrastructure as Zoom daily user count has shot(#included 2020-04-05) up from 10 million to 200 million over the past month due to coronavirus shelter - in - place orders(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) , Zoom 's found(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) Zoom caught(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) off guard .
Zoom CEO Eric Yuan apologized(#included 2020-W14) for the security failures(#included 2020-W14) this week and vowed(#included 2020-04-05) changes .
But at the time , Zoom merely said(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) Zoom would default(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to making(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) screensharing host - only and keeping(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) waiting rooms on for Zoom K-12 education users .
Clearly Zoom determined(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) that was n't sufficient , so now waiting rooms are on by default for everyone .
Zoom communicated(#included this afternoon) the changes to users via an email sent(#included this afternoon) this afternoon that explains(#included this afternoon) " we â€™ve chosen(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to enable(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) passwords on your meetings and turn(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) on Waiting Rooms by default as additional security enhancements(#included this afternoon) to protect(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) your privacy . "
The shift could cause(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) some hassle(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) for users .
Hosts will be distracted(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) by having to approve(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) attendees out of the waiting(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) room while Hosts 're trying(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to lead(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) calls(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) .
Zoom recommends(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) users resend(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) invites(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) with passwords attached(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) for Meeting ID - based calls(#after 2020-04-05) scheduled(#included PRESENT_REF) for after April 5th .
Scrambling(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to find(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) passwords could make(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) people late to calls .
But make 's a reasonable price to pay(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to keep(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) people from being scarred(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) by Zoombombing attacks(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) .
The rash of trolling(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) threatened(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to sour(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) many people 's early experiences with the video chat platform just as the video chat platform 's been having(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) the video chat platform breakout moment .
A single call(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) marred(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) by disturbing(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) pornography can leave(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) a stronger impression than 100 peaceful ones with friends and colleagues .
Technologists will need(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to grow(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) better at anticipating(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) worst - case scenarios as Technologists products go(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) mainstream and are adapted(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to new use cases .
Assuming(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) everyone will have(#after 2020-04-03 21:43:06) the best intentions ignores(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) the reality of human nature .
There 's always someone looking(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) to generate(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) a profit , score power , or cause(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) chaos from even the smallest opportunity .
Building(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) development teams that include(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) skeptics and realists , rather than just visionary idealists , could keep(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) ensure(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) products get(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:43:06) safeguarded(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) from abuse(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) before rather than after a scandal(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) occurs(#before 2020-04-03 21:43:06) .
