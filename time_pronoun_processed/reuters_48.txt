The coronavirus pandemic has rekindled(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) rivalry in Turkey between Erdogan and Istanbul ’s opposition mayor , with disputes over fundraising(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) and a potential lockdown(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) possibly imperiling(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a coordinated(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) effort to combat(#after 2020-04-01 13:37:25) The coronavirus pandemic .

The central government in Ankara has said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a money - raising campaign launched by the mayor of Istanbul , Ekrem Imamoglu , is illegal and The central government in Ankara has threatened(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) to prosecute(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) those involved(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) .
Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency , launched(#included this week) a money - raising campaign launched by the mayor of Istanbul , Ekrem Imamoglu , this week with the slogan “ We will succeed(#after 2020-04-01 13:37:25) together ” , seeking(#included this week) cash and other donations(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) from wealthier Turks for hundreds of thousands of those in need .
Erdogan then launched(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a rival “ National Solidarity ” campaign(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) and promised(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) seven months of Erdogan salary to the cause .
Various state institutions , firms and politicians made(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) contributions .
Turkey ’s Interior Ministry said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a money - raising campaign launched by the mayor of Istanbul , Ekrem Imamoglu , contravened(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a law requiring(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) that permission be sought(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) from authorities before collecting(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) money for the needy and said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a money - raising campaign launched by the mayor of Istanbul , Ekrem Imamoglu , would act(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) against those responsible .
The rivalry is about much more than money - raising(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) , though .
Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency wants(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a lockdown(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) in Istanbul , Turkey ’s largest city with 16 million people , to slow(#after 2020-04-01 13:37:25) the spread of coronavirus , while Erdogan - who has adopted(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) some other containment measures - is resisting(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) such a move(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) to cushion(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) the economic pain .
Turkey ’s confirmed(#included Tuesday) coronavirus cases jumped(#included Tuesday) to 13,531 on Tuesday , making(#included Tuesday) Turkey ’s the 10th worst affected(#included Tuesday) country in the world , with 214 deaths(#included Tuesday) .
Ankara has halted(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) all international flights(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) , limited domestic travel(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) , closed schools , bars and cafes and suspended(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) mass prayers and sports fixtures to counter(#included Tuesday) The coronavirus pandemic .
But people are still going(#after 2020-04-01 13:37:25) to work(#after 2020-04-01 13:37:25) as Erdogan seeks(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) to sustain(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) economic production(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) and exports .
ISTANBUL AT RISK
Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency has not discussed(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) The coronavirus pandemic with Erdogan since the first case was reported(#included this week) in Turkey on March 11 , though Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) “ Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency would like(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) to ” share information .
“ Istanbul is clearly now the fundamental center of The coronavirus pandemic , ” Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency told(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) FOX TV .
“ If just 15 % of people go(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) out in Istanbul , just 15 % of people is 2.5 million people - as much as the ( entire population of some ) cities in Europe which are lamenting(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) their situation . ”
Imamoglu , from the main opposition Republican People ’s Party ( CHP ) , dealt(#included a year ago) Erdogan the worst electoral setback of Erdogan career when Erdogan beat(#included a year ago) a candidate from the ruling(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) AK Party in a mayoral poll a year ago , and later logged(#included a year ago) an even bigger victory(#included a year ago) in a re - run .
Imamoglu , seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency has since repeatedly locked(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) horns with The central government in Ankara on issues such as funding and an Istanbul canal project .
Now Istanbul , with nearly a fifth of Turkey ’s population , is central(#included Now) to the fight against the pandemic .
On a money - raising campaign launched by the mayor of Istanbul , Ekrem Imamoglu , , Turkish media reports(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) one state bank had blocked(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) donation accounts run(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) by both Istanbul and the municipality of Ankara , where a the main opposition Republican People ’s Party ( CHP ) mayor was also elected(#included last year) last year , and which also launched(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a local fundraising(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) campaign(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) .
Istanbul insists(#overlap 2020-04-01 13:37:25) Istanbul has(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) the right to collect(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) donations(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) under the relevant law .
Separately , Istanbul has filed(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) a legal complaint about what Istanbul said(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) were orchestrated(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) social media posts accusing(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) the city council of allowing(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) overcrowding on public transport that undermined(#before 2020-04-01 13:37:25) the fight against the pandemic .
