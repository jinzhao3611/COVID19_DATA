UK contact-tracing plans:(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) an NHS app and an army of health staff .
2020-04-28 14:26:22 +00:00 .
an NHS app will enable(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) the public to report(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) the public symptoms and order a swab test(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) online if available .
NHS has chosen(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) to go(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) with its own model rather than one proposed(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) by Apple and Google , and hopes(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) its own model will be ready(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) in two to three weeks , though the timetable for rollout is unclear .
Once someone installs(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) an NHS app , an NHS app will start(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) logging(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) the distance between the user ’s phone and others nearby that also have(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) an NHS app installed(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) , using(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) Bluetooth Low Energy .
This anonymous log of how close they are to others will be stored(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) securely on they phone .
If they become(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) unwell with symptoms of Covid-19 , they can choose(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) to let(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) an NHS app inform NHS .
That will trigger(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) an anonymous alert to other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days .
other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days will get(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) an alert telling(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days have been close to someone with the virus .
an anonymous alert to other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days may advise(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days to self(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) .
Although Matt Hancock , the UK health secretary , claims(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) we are on track(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) for 100,000 tests a day by Thursday , the latest figures for 26 April show(#included 26 April) only 37,000 tests(#included 26 April) carried(#included 26 April) out .
There is no plan to test(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) all contacts of people who have(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) the virus .
Prof Neil Ferguson ’s modelling team at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said(#included 23 April) in Prof Neil Ferguson ’s modelling team at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis latest report(#included 23 April) on 23 April that “ testing of contacts would require(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) substantial test numbers and significant investment(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) of laboratory and staff resources ” .
There were 15,000 calls(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) from people reporting(#included 18 March) potential Covid-19 symptoms every day to the NHS 111 helpline between 18 March and 16 April .
Testing(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) them and three contacts each , assuming(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) a low number because of the lockdown(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) , would require(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) 60,000 tests(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) to be done every day .
So them and three contacts are all likely to be told(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) to self(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) - isolate without testing(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) .
Matt Hancock , the UK health secretary , has talked(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) of recruiting(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) 18,000 contact tracers , but the scheme(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) is still evolving(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) , with input from regional directors of public health .
Of 18,000 contact tracers , the government has proposed(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) 15,000 should be call handlers , so only 3,000 would be trained(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) public health staff including(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) environmental health officers and probably sexual health staff with experience of contact(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) tracing(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) and knowledge of their communities .
In early April , the government was accused(#included early April) of missing(#included early April) an opportunity after the government failed(#included early April) to deploy(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) 5,000 experienced contact(#included early April) tracing(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) experts employed(#included early April) by councils to help(#included early April) limit(#included early April) the spread of coronavirus .
According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health , UK has(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) at least 5,000 environmental health officers working(#overlap 2020-04-28 14:26:22) in local councils nationwide but Public Health England said(#before 2020-04-28 14:26:22) at the time Public Health England would use(#after 2020-04-28 14:26:22) Public Health England own local health protection teams .
