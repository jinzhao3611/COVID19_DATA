Why the 'CBS Evening News' failed(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) to air(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) for a chunk of America .
2020-05-20 04:24:09 +00:00 .
East coast viewers expecting(#included Tuesday) to see(#included Tuesday) the " CBS Evening News " on Tuesday were perhaps a bit puzzled(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) when the " CBS Evening News " failed(#included Tuesday) to air(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) .
Instead , viewers who tuned(#included 6:30 pm) in were treated(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) to several promos for the " CBS Evening News " shows , and then later a feed from CBSN , the " CBS Evening News " 24 - hour digital streaming(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) network .
It 's extremely rare for a network newscast to fail(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) to air(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) in such a fashion .
In a statement(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) , the " CBS Evening News " blamed(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) unspecified " technical difficulties(#included 6:30 pm) " that " prevented(#included 6:30 pm) the " CBS Evening News " from airing(#included 6:30 pm) at 6:30 pm , ET on the CBS Television Network .
" the CBS Television Network resolved(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) the issue in time to air(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) the program ( which included(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) an interview(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) with Mark Zuckerberg ) for the west coast , and added(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) that the " CBS Evening News " would be made(#after 2020-05-20 04:24:09) available on the CBS Television Network website .
" Thanks everybody for checking(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) in , the CBS Television Network 're fine , " Norah O'Donnell assured(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) viewers in an Instagram post . "
But there was a major technical issue that prevented(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) the " CBS Evening News " from being seen(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) on the west coast .
" Norah O'Donnell pointed(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) out , " the " CBS Evening News " 's a broadcast(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) in the era of Covid . "
Norah O'Donnell was likely referring(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) to the fact that the " CBS Evening News " is no longer anchored(#overlap 2020-05-20 04:24:09) at the CBS Television Network because of the coronavirus .
the CBS Television Network was closed(#included March 11) on March 11 — before most lockdowns(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) — after two employees tested(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) positive for Covid .
Technical teams and editorial teams have been working(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) from home while the CBS Television Network maintains(#overlap 2020-05-20 04:24:09) a skeleton staff in the CBS Television Network .
And the " CBS Evening News " has been routed(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) from D.C. and a backup facility in New York .
" the CBS Television Network have(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) a very small team here in our DC bureau , " Norah O'Donnell explained(#included Tuesday) in Norah O'Donnell Instagram video .
" Thank(#included today) you to a very small team here in our DC bureau for all a very small team here in our DC bureau hard work , everyday , and especially today . "
Compounding(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) the problem is that unlike other networks , Norah O'Donnell 'm told(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) , the " CBS Evening News " does n't have(#overlap 2020-05-20 04:24:09) a back - up control room .
the " CBS Evening News " had been operating(#before Tuesday night) two - months without an incident(#before 2020-05-20 04:24:09) , until Tuesday night .
