Premier League could return(#included mid-June) by mid-June in 'best-case scenario' .
2020-04-17 21:01:38 +00:00 .
Premier League clubs have discussed(#included 13) resuming(#included the) the season on the weekend of 13 - 14 June after Uefa wrote(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) to domestic associations stating(#included 13) a desire(#included the) domestic associations should finish(#included the) domestic associations competitions by 31 July to leave(#included mid-June) August clear for the completion(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) of the Champions League and Europa League .
wrote formed(#included Friday) the basis of a two - hour conference(#included Friday) call(#included Friday) on Friday that explored(#included Friday) how Premier League may be concluded(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) .
While any resumption(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) is being modelled(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) on matches occurring(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) behind closed doors , guiding(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the decision - making is the overriding(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) principle that the National Health Service ’s ability to treat(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) those with Covid-19 should not be compromised(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) and that the National Health Service has to be at ease with the top - flight restarting(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) .
be means Premier League wants(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the National Health Service to give(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the go - ahead
and so the health service has(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) power of veto .
In the best - case scenario clubs would have(#included the) a “ pre - season ” from 10 or 14 May , giving(#included 14 May) players four weeks to regain(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) fitness , with the minimum players would need(#Depend-on 2020-04-17 21:01:38) set(#included the) at two weeks .
If training began(#included the) three or four weeks before the weekend of 13 - 14 June , the opening days may feature(#included the) players training(#included the) individually or in small groups to ensure(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the best protection before squads worked(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) together as normal .
Protocols devised(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) by Premier League and club doctors and signed(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) off by the requisite bodies
would have(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) testing at the forefront and would be in place to try(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) to ensure(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) a safe return(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) to games(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) .
Those at matches – players , club staff , officials , security and media – would all have to be tested(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) and there would have to be procedures(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) to address(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the prospect of large groups of fans gathering(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) outside stadiums .
the National Health Service ’s wish is that the Champions League and Europa League should each recommence(#included 14 May) from the week of Monday 3 August with the final of the former being staged(#included 13) on Saturday 29 August and that of the latter to be played(#included the) a few days before .
If Premier League was to restart(#included the) on 13 June – a Saturday – Premier League would allow(#included the) seven weeks to finish(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the season .
As 16 clubs have(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) nine matches left and Manchester City , Sheffield United , Aston Villa and Arsenal have(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) 10 , the timeframe would appear(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) to be long enough for the campaign to be finished(#included the) comfortably .
It is understood(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) Premier League is conscious of a worst - case scenario given(#overlap 2020-04-17 21:01:38) the unpredictability of coronavirus and how long it may take(#before 2020-04-17 21:01:38) to tackle(#after 2020-04-17 21:01:38) coronavirus .
The pessimistic view is that no football can resume(#before 2020-04-17) until October , seven months after the last round of matches .
