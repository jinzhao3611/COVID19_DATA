At least two more New York Stock Exchange floor traders tested(#included 2020-03-31) positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday despite measures(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) taken(#included 2020-03-31) to prevent(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) people infected(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) by the coronavirus from entering(#included last week) NYSE while the coronavirus remained(#included last week) physically open last week , according to a memo seen by Reuters .
“ Given the possibility of exposure , and consistent with local , state , and federal government guidance , we recommend(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) that all those who worked(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) on NYSE over the last 14 days should self(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) until a two week symptom - free period has elapsed(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) , ” NYSE said in a memo to traders .
New York City , home to more than 8 million people , has become(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) a hot spot in the coronavirus pandemic(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) , with 157 deaths(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) and some 15,000 cases of COVID-19 reported(#included 2020-03-31) as of Tuesday .
NYSE kept(#included last week) its trading floor open last week , screening(#included last week) everyone entering(#included last week) 11 Wall Street , but temporarily shuttered(#included Friday) the iconic open outcry(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) space after market close on Tuesday , two days after a floor trader and an NYSE employee tested(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) positive for the coronavirus .
At the time , NYSE said(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) neither person who tested(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) positive with the coronavirus had entered(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) NYSE thanks to strict screening efforts and that NYSE felt(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) comfortable remaining(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) open until the shift(#included the following week) to fully electronic trading(#included the following week) for the first time NYSE ’s 228 - year history the following(#included the following week) week .
But the traders who tested(#included 2020-03-31) positive on Tuesday were working(#included 2020-03-31) on its trading floor last week in close quarters with other traders , according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who asked(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) to remain(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) anonymous given(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) the sensitivity of the matter .
“ Those previously tested(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) whose results remain(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) outstanding will be notified(#after 2020-03-25 00:46:50) directly by the medical team when results become(#after 2020-03-25 00:46:50) available , ” NYSE said(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) in a memo seen by Reuters .
NYSE has not publicly commented(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) on the new cases .
While its trading floor is temporarily closed(#before 2020-03-25 00:46:50) over the health concerns , U.S.-listed stocks continue(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) to trade(#overlap 2020-03-25 00:46:50) electronically across all 13 active U.S. stock exchanges .
