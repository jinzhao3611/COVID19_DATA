MLB pushes(#included Opening Day) back Opening Day for a second time as coronavirus continues(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to spread(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) .
2020-03-16 20:56:53 +00:00 .
On Sunday , the CDC recommended(#included Opening Day) halting(#included Opening Day) public gatherings of more than 50 people , including(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) sporting(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) events , for eight weeks — which MLB cited(#included Sunday) in saying(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) , “ The opening of the 2020 regular season will be pushed(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) back in accordance with that guidance(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) . ”
Cardinals pitcher Andrew Miller , a longtime union leader , told(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) the St. Louis Post - Dispatch : “ It ’s going(#included 2020) to be a while , Cardinals pitcher Andrew Miller , a longtime union leader , think(#included Memorial) .
I ’ve heard(#included June 1) June 1 .
I ’ve heard(#included Memorial) Opening Day .
Some people think(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) later than that .
That discussion is going(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to be interesting(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) . ”
The new , though nebulous timeline — with the second week of May now representing(#included PRESENT_REF) a best - case scenario — makes(#included PRESENT_REF) it increasingly unlikely baseball can contest(#included 2020) an entire , 162 - game regular season in 2020 .
MLB officials “ remain(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) committed(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to playing(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) as many games as possible when the season begins(#included June 1) , ” the league statement Monday .
It was only late last week that the NBA and NHL announced(#included late last week) the suspension of the NBA and NHL regular seasons , and MLB announced(#included Memorial) a delay of MLB own .
the NBA and NHL , however , initially took(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) a more optimistic view as to the lengths of the stoppages — a view that appears to no longer apply(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) .
In a memo sent(#included Sunday) to NHL players Monday , NHL cited(#included Sunday) the the CDC - recommended eight - week ban(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) on large gatherings and proposed(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) a best - case scenario of training camps reopening around late April and games resuming eventually .
The NHL ’s hope has been to still to play(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) a full regular season , and award(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) the Stanley Cup .
For now , NHL said(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) , all players , including(#included Memorial) those from foreign countries , can return(#included 2020) home and must stay(#included 2020) in self - quarantine until March 27 .
a best - case scenario of training camps reopening around late April and games resuming eventually ’s a different directive(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) than players received(#included late last week) just days earlier , when NHL asked(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) players to remain(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) close to where players play(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) and self - quarantine .
Unlike the NHL or NHL , baseball ’s calendar is hemmed(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) in by the winter weather in the northern half of the country , which would make(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) it impossible to extend(#included 2020) the postseason schedule deep into November or beyond — barring(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) an unprecedented move(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to a neutral - site stadium with a dome or in a warmer climate .
In 1995 , the last time Opening Day was delayed(#included late last week) — in that case by a players ’ strike(#included late last week) that pushed(#included 2020) the season ’s start to late April — teams conducted(#included 2020) a condensed(#Depend-on 2020-03-16 20:56:53) , two - week spring training before launching(#included 2020) into an abbreviated(#included 2020) , 144 - game season .
The main difference this time is that spring training was already well underway when the stoppage came(#included Opening Day) , with pitchers well into pitchers arm - strengthening buildup(#included Opening Day) of innings .
NHL likely would need(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to conduct(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) an abbreviated , “ second ” spring training for the sake of pitchers before NHL rescheduled(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) Opening Day .
On Monday , players continued(#included Sunday) to depart(#included Sunday) MLB spring training camps , after MLB informed(#included Sunday) teams teams were no longer allowed(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to organize(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) workouts .
MLB spring training camps will not be closed(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) off to players , but players are being urged(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to stay(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) away .
“ The NHL ’s really encouraging players to make(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) a decision where players want(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to be over an extended period of time and get(#included late April) to that location as soon as possible , ” Cardinals pitcher Andrew Miller , a longtime union leader , told(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) the St. Louis Post - Dispatch .
According to a memo union leadership sent(#included Opening Day) to agents Monday , big league players who leave their camps will be eligible to receive(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) a $ 1,100 - per - week living allowance through the MLBPA until at least April 9 .
The latest delay(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) to the season leaves(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) a cascade(#overlap 2020-03-16 20:56:53) of issues for the NBA and NHL to iron(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) out , including(#included 2020) player salaries for 2020 , the accruing(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) of service time , a temporary halting of roster moves(#before 2020-03-16 20:56:53) and the conditions for the eventual resumption(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) of play .
But all of those issues are secondary to the primary question for baseball , and for all sports : When will the games return(#after 2020-03-16 20:56:53) ?
