TV doctor Hilary Jones told(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) Good Morning Britain : “ That makes(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) a mockery of test - and - trace right there , does n’t That ?
How , if you test(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) for Covid-19 and a contact tracer says(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) , ‘ Where ’ve you been in the last few days ? ’ , and you say(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) , ‘ a contact tracer was on the beach at Bournemouth or Southend on Sea ’ , amongst those crowds , who do you know(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) who was next to you ?
“ You ca n’t possibly trace(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) those people , and trace ’s the problem .

“ And how many of those people would have(#after 2020-05-21 18:47:29) the much - vaunted smartphone app on the beach ?
those people wo n’t take(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) their phone because those people do n’t want(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) their phone stolen(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) , even if those people have(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) a phone and even if the much - vaunted smartphone app on the beach works(#overlap 2020-05-21 18:47:29) as efficiently as those people want(#before 2020-05-21 18:47:29) the much - vaunted smartphone app on the beach to . ”
