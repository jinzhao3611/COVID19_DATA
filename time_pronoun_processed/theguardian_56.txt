2020-03-19 13:15:56 +00:00 .
Sebastian Coe has admitted(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) that “ nobody is saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) we will be going(#after 2020-03-19 13:15:56) to the Games come what may ” as the debate(#included September) over whether the Tokyo Olympics should be staged(#included this summer) this summer continues(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) to intensify(#included now) .
A growing number of athletes and athlete representatives , including Britain ’s world heptathlon champion , Katarina Johnson - Thompson , and the Olympic pole vault gold medallist , Katerina Stefanidi of Greece , have expressed(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) A growing number of athletes and athlete representatives , including Britain ’s world heptathlon champion , Katarina Johnson - Thompson concerns about being able to prepare(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) for the Games with much of Europe in lockdown(#included this) .
The president of World Athletics has now accepted(#included now) that nothing is off the table in terms of future planning(#after 2020-03-19 13:15:56) – including(#included now) moving(#included September) the Games to September or October – because of the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) .
“ That is possible , anything is possible at the moment , ” said(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) Sebastian Coe .
“ Sebastian Coe think(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) the position that sport has taken(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) , and sport was certainly the temperature of the room in the conversation(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) Sebastian Coe had(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) the other day with the IOC and our other federations , is that nobody is saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) World Athletics will be going(#after 2020-03-19 13:15:56) to the Games come what may . ”
Nevertheless , Sebastian Coe does not believe(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) a decision has to be taken(#included now) yet .
“ It may be that over the course of changing(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) events , and they ’re changing(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) by the hour , that changing is something we have to confront(#after 2020-03-19 13:15:56) , ” Sebastian Coe said(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) .
“ But it is n’t a decision that has to be made(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) at this moment . ”
Asked(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) if the Games could be delayed(#before 2021) until 2021 , Sebastian Coe added(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) : “ That seems(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) on the surface of it an easy proposition , but member federations actually avoid(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) Olympic years often to have(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) their world championships .
World Athletics has(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) their world championships at exactly those dates that you ’re talking(#included next year) about in 2021 in the United States [ 6 - 15 August ]
so it ’s not quite as easy(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) as just saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) we ’ll move(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) one down .
“ The European football championships have moved(#included next year) to next year , moved would clash(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) .
The sporting(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) calendar is a very complicated matrix , it ’s not that simple to just simply say(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) we ’ll ease(#after 2020-03-19 13:15:56) one event from one year to the next .
we ’ll have done ease with The European football championships but ease does n’t clash(#included Today) with anything else at the same time . ”
As for the prospect of combining(#included 2021) the Games and the world championships next year , Sebastian Coe told(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) Radio 4 ’s Today programme : “ It would be ridiculous of Sebastian Coe to say(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) anything is ruled(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) out at the moment .
We are living(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) in an environment where everything is changing(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) very quickly , the whole world wants(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) clarity , that ’s just simply not possible at the moment and we ’ll no different from any other sector . ”
Meanwhile the four - times Olympic champion Sir Matthew Pinsent has increased(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) the four - times Olympic champion Sir Matthew Pinsent criticism(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) of the IOC , saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) it would be “ folly ” to allow(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) the Games to go(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) ahead .
“ Sebastian Coe think(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) it ’s the IOC saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) the IOC must try(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) and get(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) through if the IOC can , which Sebastian Coe have(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) a degree of sympathy with , it just runs(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) counter to what every health authority and government is saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) around the whole world , ” the four - times Olympic champion Sir Matthew Pinsent told(#included Today) Radio 4 ’s Today programme .
“ On a global front we have(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) other priorities and Sebastian Coe think(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) the Games should at the very least be saying(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) we should postpone(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) or indeed just cancel(#before 2021) at this stage and we ’ll talk(#included next year) about postponement(#after 2020-03-19 13:15:56) later on .
Sebastian Coe just do n’t think(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) there ’s much of a choice at this stage .
For much of the European countries as well as Asian countries , organised(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) sport in any meaningful way has ceased(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) and that ’s from government advice .
Sebastian Coe do n’t see(#before 2020-03-19 13:15:56) there ’s any way forward for an Olympic athlete to train(#overlap 2020-03-19 13:15:56) effectively even as an individual but particularly in a team environment . ”
