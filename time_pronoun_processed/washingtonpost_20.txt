2020-03-29 21:41:56 +00:00 .
Brazilians are feeling(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) a lot of anxiety and can no longer bear(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) this lack of leadership .
For weeks , Brazilians have protested(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) from Brazilians homes by banging(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) saucepans and shouting(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) “ Bolsonaro out ” from Brazilians windows .
Support for Bolsonaro impeachment(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) has risen(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) drastically , according to Atlas Politico , with almost half of the population backing(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro removal(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
In recent days , Bolsonaro has contradicted(#included recent days) Bolsonaro own health experts , calling(#included recent days) self - isolation “ mass confinement ” and covid-19 a “ little cold . ”
Bolsonaro attended(#included March 15) a rally and shook(#included March 15) hands with supporters on March 15 , drawing(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) criticism for encouraging(#included recent days) large gatherings .
Bolsonaro also told(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro followers , via social media and official channels , to attend(#included March 25) a demonstration(#included March 25) on March 25 in support of Bolsonaro administration .
And Bolsonaro has been ignoring(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) recommendations(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) to practice(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) social distancing after members of his own staff tested(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) positive for the virus .
It ’s clear(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro has abandoned(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro duty to protect(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the population .
Bolsonaro thinks(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the virus is a media trick(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
“ members of his own staff spread(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the sensation of dread , " Bolsonaro said(#included March 24) on March 24 .
" The perfect scenario to be used(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) by the media to spread(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) hysteria . ”
The spread of the virus could collapse(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the public health system in Brazil .
Thankfully , health - care professionals and local and state governments are mobilizing(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) to respond(#after 2020-03-29 21:41:56) to cases and asking(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) people to stay(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) home , openly defying(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) a president already calling(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) for a return(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) to “ normality ” and to work(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
Members of the National Congress from different parties have started(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) calling(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) for impeachment(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
But there is no consensus among the opposition .
Some , citing(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the constitution , argue(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) in favor of mental health interdiction(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) of the president ; others say(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the National Congress should invoke(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the social protection provision .
Some simply want(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro to implode(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) , letting(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro “ bleed(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) ” until the next election , in 2022 .
On March 17 , some members of the National Congress formally introduced(#included March 17) an impeachment(#included March 24) request(#included March 17) signed(#included March 17) by scientists , artists , activists and public intellectuals .
Citizens and organized(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) civil society have gotten(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) behind the petition to impeach .
Since March 17 , close to 1 million people have signed(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the petition to impeach .
It ’s clear that , beyond any political calculation(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) , allowing(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro to stay(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) in power is unsustainable .
Since Bolsonaro election(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) , Bolsonaro has led(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Brazil by following(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) a fascist playbook , attacking(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) the press and indigenous peoples , eroding(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) human rights protections , and offering(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) apologies(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) for dictatorship and torture(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
Bolsonaro has gone(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) from breach of decorum to abuse(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) of power to attacks(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) against the constitution .
Bolsonaro mismanagement(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) of the virus has only intensified(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro crimes(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) of irresponsibility .
Impeachment can be a difficult political and legal process(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
( Brazilians not long ago lived(#included not) through a politicized and unfair process against Dilma Rousseff that amounted(#included March 17) to a coup(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) . )
But the case against Bolsonaro is bulletproof .
Today Bolsonaro represents(#included Today) an existential threat .
There must be both deep political articulation(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) and social legitimacy to carry(#after 2020-03-29 21:41:56) out Bolsonaro removal(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) , and a transition(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) must be carefully planned(#overlap 2020-03-29 21:41:56) .
Brazilians are now rejecting(#included PRESENT_REF) Bolsonaro ’s legitimacy .
Our political leaders must move(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) forward and vote(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) to impeach(#before 2020-03-29 21:41:56) Bolsonaro .
