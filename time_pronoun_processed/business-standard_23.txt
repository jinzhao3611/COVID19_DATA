Covid-19 impact:(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) Fruit, veggie exports to fall(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) 30-40% on global lockdown(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .

India 's fruits and vegetable exports are likely to decline(#after 2020-03-29 10:01:40) by 30 - 40 per cent during the ongoing grape and mango season due to global lockdown(#included 2020-03-24) that has been implemented(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) to prevent(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) the spread of the ( Covid-19 ) pandemic(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's announcement(#included 2020-03-24) of a lockdown ( a measure similar to curfew ) for three weeks beginning March 24 has brought(#included 2020-03-24) the entire value of fruits and vegetables to a standstill(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
Despite several efforts to revive(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) mandis , distribute(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) essentials and instruct(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) ports to facilitate(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) exports , the situation is far from normal .
" Farmers have prepared(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) early mango crops - Hapus or alphonso- for exports .
Many in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra ( the hub of Hapus mango production ) had kept(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) Many in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra ( the hub of Hapus mango production ) consignments ready for delivery(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
Several enquiries were received(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) before a lockdown ( a measure similar to curfew ) for three weeks beginning March 24 .
We hope(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) the government will open(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) exports with some riders .
But , most importing markets are shut(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) and open will make(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) it difficult to executing(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) orders(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
Thus , exports would certainly be hit(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) , " said(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) Abid Raien , Director , Raien Fresh Produce , a Navi Mumbai - based fruit and vegetable exporter .
Many exporters have estimated(#included this) a 30 - 40 per cent decline(#included this) in exports this season , as by the time markets open , grape season would be over .
Most of the mango export season would also be lost(#after 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
The fruit and vegetable trade(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) across India 's is gradually coming(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) to a standstill(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) due to sealing(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) of state and district borders , which has hit(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) plying of trucks and other carriages to mandis(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) throughout India 's .
Even after easing(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) the rules , these exporters have not become(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) active .
these exporters have to protect(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) these exporters and also manage(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) cancellations(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) of orders(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
The global lockdown(#included this) and trade(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) restrictions(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) have forced(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) large - scale cancellation(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) of orders(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) .
Actual defaults of exporters and importers would be assessed(#after 2020-03-29 10:01:40) after opening(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) up the world markets .

" It takes(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) many years to build(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) a market and many serious efforts to get(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) customers , but few days to destroy(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) customers .

To ease(#after 2020-03-29 10:01:40) the problems at least on India 's ports , the Union Ministry of Shipping has asked(#before 2020-03-29 10:01:40) the Union Ministry of Shipping employees to handle(#overlap 2020-03-29 10:01:40) essential services and clear consignments wherever possible with adequate care .
