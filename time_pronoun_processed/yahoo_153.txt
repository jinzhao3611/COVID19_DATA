South Africa has(#overlap 2020-03-24 17:23:12) the highest number of confirmed(#before 2020-03-24 17:23:12) coronavirus cases in sub - Saharan Africa , and public health experts are worried(#overlap 2020-03-24 17:23:12) that the respiratory pandemic could overwhelm(#before 2020-03-24 17:23:12) the health system if infection rates rise(#before 2020-03-24 17:23:12) steeply .
President Cyril Ramaphosa deployed(#included Tuesday) the army in the streets , ordered(#included Tuesday) underground mines to suspend(#before 2020-03-24 17:23:12) operations(#before 2020-03-24 17:23:12) and confined(#included Tuesday) tourists who had arrived recently from " high - risk " countries to their hotels - some of the toughest measures on the continent .
