Heaven can wait:(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 09:25:51) what will happen(#after 2020-03-23 09:25:51) to the films delayed by coronavirus? .
2020-03-23 09:25:51 +00:00 .
We are entering(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) new territory for the movies : thanks to Covid-19 , major titles have been pulled(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) from release(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) , in anticipation of plummeting(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) audiences or cinemas shutting(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) altogether .
Will the entire schedule be rejigged(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) to ensure(#after 2020-03-23 09:25:51) an even flow ?
Or will there be a post - pandemic movie glut ?
Will some movies decide(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) to release(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) over streaming services instead ?
And will anybody want(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 09:25:51) to see(#after 2020-03-23 09:25:51) the films delayed by coronavirus? when the films delayed by coronavirus? finally get(#after 2020-03-23 09:25:51) released(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) ?
Usually when a release is delayed(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) a release is for one of several reasons .
Often , it is simply because everyone knows(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) the film sucks(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) .
Or the film is down to internal battles(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) , as with Kenneth Lonergan ’s Margaret , filmed(#included 1980s) in 2005 but held(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) up by studio disputes(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) over its 165 - minute length .
A 150 - minute cut(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) eventually surfaced(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) , to rave reviews(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) – but six years later , which killed(#included autumn 2019) the buzz somewhat .
Sometimes , it is down to controversy , as with the “ video nasties ” of the 1980s , which were eventually un - banned in the 1990s and 2000s , triggering(#included the) a spike in cannibalism and chainsaw massacres(#included the) .
And , sometimes , it is down to timing(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) , as with the trigger - happy horror The Hunt , whose autumn 2019 release(#included autumn 2019) was pulled(#included autumn 2019) in response(#included autumn 2019) to the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings .
In the intervening(#included the) period , Trump denounced(#included the) the movie , which saved on its marketing budget , although the movie , which saved on its marketing budget did n’t help(#included the) The Hunt ’s box office takings when The Hunt ’s box office takings limped(#included the) into cinemas a few weeks ago .
This time round , though , the delays(#overlap 2020-03-23 09:25:51) are through no fault of the movies or their makers .
Will the movies or their makers feel(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) out of date by the time the movies or their makers arrive(#included the) ?
Does it make(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) a difference if we get(#included the) No Time to Die in November rather than April ?
Or Furious 9 a year later ?
Vin Diesel might have(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) a whole new look by then !
Other titles are seasonally specific(#overlap 2020-03-23 09:25:51) .
It made(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) perfect sense to put(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) out Peter Rabbit 2 for the Easter holidays .
Similarly , a musical such as Spielberg ’s West Side Story has(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) “ family - friendly Christmas movie ” written(#included the) all over a musical such as Spielberg ’s West Side Story .
a musical such as Spielberg ’s West Side Story is unlikely to want(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) to budge(#included November) from a musical such as Spielberg ’s West Side Story prime December slot .
If there is a high - profile postponement in The Great Pause , a high - profile postponement in The Great Pause could be the X - Men spin - off The New Mutants .
Enticingly(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) pitched(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) as “ Stephen King meets(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) John Hughes ” , a high - profile postponement in The Great Pause was filmed(#included mid-2017) in mid-2017 with a view to a 2018 release(#included 2018) .
That date has shifted(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) many times since , due to alleged creative disputes(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) , reshoots ( since denied(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) ) and Disney ’s takeover(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) of a musical such as Spielberg ’s West Side Story studio , Fox .
Just when That date was due , this April , coronavirus has snatched(#included this April) That date away again .
Today ’s no - shows could take(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) consolation from Orson Welles ’s The Other Side of the Wind : begun(#included 1970) in 1970 , made(#included 1970) in fits and starts(#included mid-2017) , abandoned(#included 1970) , lost(#included 1970) , then finally restored(#included 2018) and completed(#included 2018) in 2018 , three decades after the deaths(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) of Orson Welles , lead actor John Huston and most of the cast .
a high - profile postponement in The Great Pause is a wayward masterpiece whose absurdly protracted genesis only enhances(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) the experience .
There is a lesson here : if the delay(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) drags(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) on for long enough , a high - profile postponement in The Great Pause ’s no longer a story , a high - profile postponement in The Great Pause becomes(#before 2020-03-23 09:25:51) a legend .
