Sturgeon has warned(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) that people may be asked(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to self(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) people repeatedly once ministers introduce(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) a new “ test , trace , isolate ” policy after lockdown eases(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
The Scottish government published(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) a new policy paper on how The Scottish government would tackle(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) future Covid-19 infections during later phases of the pandemic(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) , which will focus(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) heavily on “ early and effective ” identification(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) of new cases through testing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) , and then tracking(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) down and isolating(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) other people in contact(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) with infected people .
The Scottish government has said(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) that these five tests have to be met(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) before The Scottish government will consider(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) easing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) coronavirus lockdown(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) restrictions :
The NHS has(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) sufficient capacity to provide(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) critical care and specialist treatment(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) right across The Scottish government
A sustained and consistent fall(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) in daily deaths(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) from Coronavirus Reliable data to show(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) that the rate of infection is decreasing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to manageable levels across the board Operational challenges(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) including(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) testing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) and personal protective equipement ( PPE ) are in hand(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) with supply able to meet(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) future demand
Confident(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) that any adjustments(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to the current measures(#included current) will not risk(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) a second peak of infections that overwhelms(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) The NHS
Coronavirus Reliable said(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) Scottish labs would need(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to conduct(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) at least 15,500 tests a day , to cover(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) about 2 % of the population .
The NHS would also need(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to find(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) and train(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) 2,000 additional people to specialise(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) in contact tracing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
Coronavirus Reliable said(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) the new “ test , trace , isolate , support ” strategy would underpin(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) the post - lockdown approach , alongside all existing(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) measures(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) such as physical distancing , good hygiene such as regular handwashing , use of face coverings in crowded public places and disease surveillance(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
the new “ test , trace , isolate , support ” strategy was “ designed(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to help(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) us interrupt(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) chains of transmission in the community by identifying(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) cases of Covid-19 , tracing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) the people who may have become infected by spending time in close contact with them , and then supporting(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) those close contacts to self - isolate , so that if those close contacts to self - isolate have(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) the disease those close contacts to self - isolate are less likely transmit to the disease to others . ”
Anyone who had been closer than 2 metres from an infected person for 15 minutes or more would be required(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to self(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) for 14 days , Coronavirus Reliable said(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
Testing capacity would need(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to expand(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) dramatically to cope(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) : Scotland ’s daily testing(#included mid - May) potential would hit(#included mid - May) 8,000 samples a day by mid - May , with another 4,000 tests a day done at the UK government ’s Lighthouse laboratory at University of Glasgow .

The first minister warned(#included they) the policy would , in effect , become(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) the new normal .
the policy would be effective once community transmission rates were at a much lower level than at present , The first minister indicated(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
“ It is important to stress that “ test , trace , isolate , support ” will be most effective when levels of infection are low – lower than now – and stay(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) low , and that test success relies(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) on all of us knowing(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) and agreeing(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) what to do if all of us have(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) symptoms , and being prepared(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) to self(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) isolate when advised to do so .
“ This will not be easy(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
In this next phase , we will be asking(#after 2020-05-04 12:52:24) people to self - isolate , not for people own benefit , and not because we know(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) for certain that people have contracted(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) the disease , but in order to protect(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) others in case people have(#before 2020-05-04 12:52:24) .
“
People may face(#overlap 2020-05-04 12:52:24) self - isolation not just once , but on repeat occasions . ”
