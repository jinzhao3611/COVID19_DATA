2020-05-18 13:29:04 +00:00 .
China has confirmed(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) China will impose(#after 2020-05-18 13:29:04) a tariff of 80.5 per cent on Australia ’s barley exports following(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) the conclusion(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) of its anti - dumping investigations , delivering(#included Monday night) a massive blow to the Australian barley industry .
On Monday night , China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) said(#included Monday night) its anti - dumping investigations had proven(#included Monday night) the dumping of cheap Australian barley had hurt(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) domestic market .
“ China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) investigated(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) whether there had been dumping and damage to the Australian barley industry and the degree of damage(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) , and the causal relationship between dumping(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) and damage , ” a notice by China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) said(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) .
“ China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) has ruled(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) that there was the dumping of cheap Australian barley and the Australian barley industry suffered(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) substantial damage . ”
After issuing(#included over a week ago) a warning about impending(#included over a week ago) tariffs just over a week ago , ruled has been confirmed(#included Monday night) by the State Council Customs Tariff Commission to levy(#included November 2018) an anti - dumping tariff of 73.6 per cent and a countervailing subsidy margin of 6.9 per cent .
At the start of its anti - dumping investigations in November 2018 , Chinese authorities suggested(#included November 2018) an anti - dumping tariff of 56.14 per cent but suggested was subsequently raised(#included November 2018) to 73.6 per cent .
an anti - dumping tariff of 56.14 per cent will immediately be levied(#after 2020-05-18 13:29:04) on Australian companies The Iluka Trust , Kalgan Nominees , JW JI Mcdonald Sons and Haycroft Enterprise , according to China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) , while other companies will be liable to pay(#after 2020-05-18 13:29:04) an anti - dumping tariff of 56.14 per cent from Tuesday .
“ For new export operators who did not export barley to China during the investigation period , new export operators who did not export barley to China during the investigation period can apply(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) in writing to China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) for a new exporter ’s review , ” China ’s Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) said(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) .
The relationship between Australia and China is at a low point after the announcement(#included last week) of an anti - dumping tariff of 56.14 per cent last week and a ban(#included last week) on beef exports from four meat processing plants in Australia .
The moves(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) raised(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) suspicions in Australia that China is using(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) technical requirements to punish(#overlap 2020-05-18 13:29:04) Canberra for Canberra political position in pushing(#overlap 2020-05-18 13:29:04) to coordinate(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) an international inquiry(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) into the origins of the coronavirus following(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) a conversation with US President Donald Trump , although China had emphasised(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) the two were unrelated .
The toll on Australia ’s agricultural exports from the Chinese restrictions(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) would be heavy , especially since the A$ 1.3 billion ( US$ 834 million ) barley trade(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) to China accounts(#overlap 2020-05-18 13:29:04) for around half of Australia ’s barley exports .
Australia and China have been at loggerheads(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) previously over concerns(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) of Chinese foreign interference(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) in Australia , while China retorted(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) by accusing(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) Australia of being a mouthpiece of the United States .
While Australia too had imposed(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) Australia share of tariffs(#before 2020-05-18 13:29:04) on Chinese products such as steel and aluminium previously , Australia and China enjoy(#overlap 2020-05-18 13:29:04) zero tariffs on many other products under the China - Australia Free Trade Agreement .
