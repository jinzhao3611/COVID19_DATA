Autopsies find(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) first U.S. coronavirus death(#included early February,) occurred(#included early February,) in early February, weeks earlier than previously thought(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) .
2020-04-22 07:15:10 +00:00 .
Initially , the nation ’s earliest coronavirus fatality was believed(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) to have occurred(#included Feb. 29) on Feb. 29 , in Kirkland , Wash. , a suburb of Seattle that rapidly became(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) a hotspot .
In March , health officials there linked(#included 2020-03) two Feb. 26 deaths(#included 2020-03) to covid-19 , the disease caused(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) by the virus .
Yet , the Santa Clara County fatalities(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) still push(#overlap 2020-04-22 07:15:10) the toll of the virus back by weeks .
“ The fact that there were deaths related to covid back in early February is very significant because The fact that there were deaths related to covid back in early February means the virus was around for a lot longer than was initially realized(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) , ” Jeff Smith , a physician and the county executive in Santa Clara County , told(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) The Washington Post .
“ It ’s been around for a while and It ’s probably been spreading(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) in the community for quite some time . ”
It is not yet known(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) exactly how the two people became(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) infected(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) , but Sara Cody , the county ’s public health officer , told(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) The Washington Post that the two people are believed(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) to be community transmissions .
“ From what I understand(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) , we do n’t know(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) of any travel history , ” Sara Cody , the county ’s public health officer , , said(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) of the two people .
“ More investigation(#after 2020-04-22 07:15:10) will be done to try(#after 2020-04-22 07:15:10) and confirm(#after 2020-04-22 07:15:10) that that ’s the case . ”
The connection between the two people did not become(#included early February,) apparent until now due to strict limitations on testing(#before PRESENT_REF) at the time , Sara Cody , the county ’s public health officer , said(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) .
the two people occurred(#included 2020-03) when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) tightly restricted(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) tests to people with a known travel(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) history and specific symptoms , according to Tuesday ’s release(#included Tuesday) .
Tests on the two people could not be performed(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) until the medical examiner performed(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) autopsies .
“ the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did have(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) a very uncomfortable feeling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were missing(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) cases because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did n’t have(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) the tests to be able to confirm(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) , ” Sara Cody , the county ’s public health officer , said(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) .
“ This tells(#overlap 2020-04-22 07:15:10) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that yes , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were definitely missing(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) cases . ”
These two fatalities(#included March 6) , along with a third on March 6 , also indicate(#included March 6) that coronavirus was likely spreading(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) earlier and further in the San Francisco Bay area than previously thought(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) .
As Sara Cody , the county ’s public health officer , explains(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) it , each severe covid-19 case or death(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) “ represent(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) tips of icebergs of unknown size . ”
“ Every time when I see(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) someone in the ICU or someone who dies(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) , what see says(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) to I is that represents(#overlap 2020-04-22 07:15:10) many more infections , ” I said(#before 2020-04-22 07:15:10) .
