Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East , echoed(#included Tuesday) the call(#included Tuesday) for a ceasefire .
“ Because to some extent ICRC ca n’t fight(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) two battles(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) at the same time , ” Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) in an interview(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) with Reuters .
“ ICRC ca n’t dedicate(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) time and energy to what the pandemic(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) response(#after 2020-03-24 19:04:12) requires(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) and at the same time be addressing(#included recently) the emergency(#included recently) needs of people recently displaced(#included recently) or destitute . ”
Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East disclosed(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) that ICRC has asked(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) Syrian authorities to allow(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) ICRC to help(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) with infection prevention(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) measures and to provide(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) hygiene supplies at nine central prisons .
“ Now ICRC hope(#included Now) that Syrian authorities will answer(#included Now) positively very soon to ICRC proposal(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) , ” Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
“ ICRC believe(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) that people detained(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) and displaced(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) are even more vulnerable than the general population . ”
ICRC is the only agency allowed(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) into ICRC detention(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) centres - where some experts estimate(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) some 130,000 people are held(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
Syria announced(#included Sunday) on Sunday Syria first coronavirus case after unconfirmed reports(#included Sunday) suggested(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) the coronavirus had been detected(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) but covered(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) up , a charge(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) officials denied(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
“ Healthcare facilities have been destroyed(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) or are degraded(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
There is a shortage of key medical equipment and health professionals , ” Geir Pedersen , the U.N. special envoy for Syria said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) that while Syrian health officials say(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) the number of cases is quite limited , quick action is needed(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) to halt(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) a spread , including(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) the provision(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) of clean water .
“ Even if there are five or 10 cases , ICRC work(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) would still be to focus(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) on making(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) sure that water reaches people because without water you ca n’t wash(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) your hands , ” Geir Pedersen , the U.N. special envoy for Syria said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
In al - Hasakah , the largest city in the northeast , a pumping station providing water to 800,000 people has been out of operation(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) for three days and needs(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) repair , Geir Pedersen , the U.N. special envoy for Syria said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
“ ICRC installed(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) 45 water tanks all around al - Hasakah , the largest city in the northeast and are water trucking(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) until ICRC can fix(#after 2020-03-24 19:04:12) a pumping station providing water to 800,000 people and can have(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) access , ” Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
The focus across Syria must be on prevention , Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
“ Because when they start(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) having(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) cases , and if it gets(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) out of hand , it ’s going to be very , very difficult to address(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) , as we can see(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) in many Western countries where they have(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) way more sophisticated health systems , ” Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East also noted(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) the difficulties of putting(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) in place general health guidance for containing(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) the spread of the coronavirus .
“ The way to address(#included Sunday) the pandemic is to stay(#included Sunday) home , ” Fabrizio Carboni , ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East said(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) .
“ But when you are an IDP ( internally displaced person ) , you do n’t have(#overlap 2020-03-24 19:04:12) a home .
How do you do have ?
Certainly social distancing becomes(#before 2020-03-24 19:04:12) a luxury . ”
