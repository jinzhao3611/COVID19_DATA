By Neha Arora and Mayank Bhardwaj NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Residents of New Delhi are experiencing(#overlap 2020-04-22 06:49:51) the longest spell of clean air on record , according to government data , as a stringent lockdown(#overlap 2020-04-22 06:49:51) to prevent(#after 2020-04-22 06:49:51) the spread of novel coronavirus drastically cuts(#overlap 2020-04-22 06:49:51) pollution in the world 's most polluted capital .
With all transport and construction suspended(#overlap 2020-04-22 06:49:51) , good air has emerged(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) as one of the few positive byproducts of India's virus lockdown .
A combination of industrial , agricultural and vehicle pollution blankets New Delhi and dozens of other Indian cities with a thick grey smog for several months of the year .
New Delhi was the world 's most polluted(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) capital for the second year running(#included 2019) in 2019 , according to IQ AirVisual , a Swiss group that gathers air quality data globally .
But during the first 25 days of India's virus lockdown , the concentration of poisonous PM2.5 particles in a cubic metre of air averaged(#included March 22) at 44.18 , according to a Reuters analysis(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) of government data , indicating(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) a rare " good " rating , the safest level on the scale .

averaged is sharply down from an average concentration(#included 2019) of 81.88 , recorded(#included 2019) between March 22 and April 15 of 2019 , according to the analysis(#included 2019) of data gathered(#included 2019) by the state - run Central Pollution Control Board .
IQ AirVisual , a Swiss group that gathers air quality data globally said(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) New Delhi average annual concentration of PM2.5 in a cubic metre of air was 98.6 in 2019 .
" Clean air has come(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) as a boon , " said(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) Rakesh Singh , a computer engineer who lives in Noida , a satellite city of New Delhi .
" Breathing(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) good air will only boost(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) Rakesh Singh , a computer engineer who lives in Noida , a satellite city of New Delhi immunity against the coronavirus . "
The reading is the best on record for Noida , a satellite city of New Delhi since the government began(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) collecting(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) detailed data .
New Delhi had(#before 2016) few pollution monitors before 2016 , making(#before 2016) like - for - like comparisons before then difficult .
Vehicular exhaust and dust from construction work significantly contributes(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) to air pollution in New Delhi .
New Delhi has(#overlap 2020-04-22 06:49:51) nearly 10 million vehicles , more than the other three major cities - Mumbai , Chennai and Kolkata - put(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) together .
Shutting(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) down India $ 2.9 trillion economy has also significantly cut(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) India fuel and power demand , helping(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) pollution levels plummet(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) .
As power demand plunged(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) , 11 of the 12 coal - fired plants situated within a 300 km ( 185 - mile ) radius of New Delhi have closed(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) 11 of the 12 coal - fired plants situated within a 300 km ( 185 - mile ) radius of New Delhi operations , said(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) Sunil Dahiya , an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ) .
Consumption of diesel is down by nearly a quarter year - on - year , Sunil Dahiya , an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ) added(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) .
But while the 20 million inhabitants of New Delhi will be breathing(#included Wednesday) good air ahead of Earth Day on Wednesday , the respite(#included Wednesday) from the pollution(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) could be short - lived .
Experts warn(#overlap 2020-04-22 06:49:51) that air quality will drop(#after 2020-04-22 06:49:51) sharply once the government lifts(#before 2016) India's virus lockdown .
" After India's virus lockdown , we 'll see(#after 2020-04-22 06:49:51) new stimulus packages and revival(#after 2020-04-22 06:49:51) plans for the economy , and Sunil Dahiya , an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ) biggest fear is that the environment will be the first casualty , " said(#before 2020-04-22 06:49:51) Sunil Dahiya , an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ) .
