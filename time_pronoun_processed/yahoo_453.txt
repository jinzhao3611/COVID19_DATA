Retailers in England selling(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) home antibody tests , including Superdrug and Babylon , have been told(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) to stop(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) sending(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) home antibody tests , including Superdrug and Babylon out , and labs must not process(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) home antibody tests , including Superdrug and Babylon , while the regulatory body examines(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) how well home antibody tests , including Superdrug and Babylon work(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) .
Although home antibody tests , including Superdrug and Babylon are made(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) by the healthcare technology firm Abbot and have been approved(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) by Public Health England ( PHE ) for the NHS to use(#after 2020-05-27 10:01:29) for frontline health and care workers , people who buy them privately must prick(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) people who buy them privately own finger and draw(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) blood to post(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) off to the lab .
The authorities appear to be questioning(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) whether a home blood sample leads(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) to a result that is as accurate as one taken(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) by a nurse in a clinic .

Those with symptoms can now use(#included now) the gov.uk website to book(#after 2020-05-27 10:01:29) home test kits or appointments at drive - through centres across England .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority has contacted(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) all the private providers and the labs The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority use(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) to tell(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) all the private providers to halt(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) the tests(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) while all the private providers assess(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) all the private providers accuracy .
Babylon said(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) Babylon can process(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) tests that are in the system , but can not send(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) people people results until given(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) the green light .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority has approved(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) two finger - prick antibody tests , by Abbott and also by Roche .

Adding(#included 18 May) to the confusion(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) , Prof John Newton , from PHE , who is in charge of speeding up testing , cast(#included 18 May) doubt on the accuracy of home tests at the science and technology select(#included last week) committee of MPs last week and indicated(#included 18 May) the government could be intending(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) to approve(#after 2020-05-27 10:01:29) a test(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) for home use .
“ The public need(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) to be aware that home tests are not the same as those The public have evaluated(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) and approved(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) for use .
two finger - prick antibody tests have(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) a much higher standard of accuracy , ” Prof John Newton , from PHE , who is in charge of speeding up testing , said(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) .
“ PHE , who is in charge of speeding up testing would n’t recommend at the moment that people rely(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) on the tests that are becoming(#overlap 2020-05-27 10:01:29) widely available .
Prof John Newton , from PHE , who is in charge of speeding up testing , advice would be to wait(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) until PHE , who is in charge of speeding up testing have(#before 2020-05-27 10:01:29) better tests which will be available in a similar form very soon , though better tests which will be available in a similar form very soon are still under evaluation(#included now) at the moment . ”
