SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Oil refiners ' profits for transportation fuels fell(#included this week) further this week , with the margin for gasoline turning(#included this week) negative for the first time in more than a year , according to Refinitiv data .
The margins plunged(#included this week) to new multi - year or multi - month lows this week after more countries globally imposed(#included this week) further travel(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) restrictions(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) and curbed(#included this week) domestic movements as part of measures(#included this week) to slow(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) down spread of the coronavirus .
Airlines and airports are facing(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) a huge shock as Airlines and airports battle(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) a cash crunch(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) resulting(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) from the coronavirus , while gasoline demand in the United States , the world 's largest oil consumer , is plunging(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) as state and local governments advise(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) people to stay(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) home and businesses shut(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) .
In Asia , refiners are now losing(#included now) 78 cents on every barrel of gasoline refiners produce(#included now) from Brent crude , refiners widest loss(#included now) in 13 months , Reuters data showed(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) .
U.S. gasoline refining margins fell(#included 2020-03-30) a whopping 95 % on Monday - briefly turning(#included 2020-03-30) negative - to settle(#included Friday) at 28 cents per barrel , U.S. gasoline refining margins lowest since December 2008 .
Asian refining margins , or cracks , for jet fuel plunged(#after December 2008) to $ 4.71 per barrel over Dubai crude , the lowest on record for Refinitiv data going(#included March 2009) back to March 2009 .
Asian refining margins , or cracks , for jet fuel were at $ 7.70 on Friday .
" I do n't expect(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) any recovery yet for jet fuel ( margins ) , and I 'm very much concerned(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) ( to know(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) ) if the current level is bottom yet ...
But jet fuel will be the last to recover(#after 2020-03-17 06:56:58) when the economy recovers(#after 2020-03-17 06:56:58) , " I said(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) .
" the world 's has to wait(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) for every country to go(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) through this virus peak .
Then demand will slowly come(#after 2020-03-17 06:56:58) back , but I guess is probably not before late third quarter , " I said(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) .
Cracks for aviation fuel have shed(#after December 2008) nearly 70 % since the beginning(#included this week) of this year as flight(#after December 2008) cancellations(#after December 2008) across regions led(#after December 2008) to unprecedented losses(#after December 2008) for airlines .
Asian refiners may have to curtail(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) jet fuel output due to the weakening(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) demand .
Jet fuel can not typically be stored(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) for long periods as Jet fuel quality would degrade(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) , increasing(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) the incentive for refiners to produce(#after 2020-03-17 06:56:58) less of Jet fuel .
" When crude prices fell(#included early last week) heavily early last week … … gave(#included early last week) incentive to refineries to keep(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) runs unchanged .
Eventually , with virus - related situation developing(#overlap 2020-03-17 06:56:58) , it 's now the second time for global refineries to think(#included now) of run(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) cuts again , " I said(#before 2020-03-17 06:56:58) .
