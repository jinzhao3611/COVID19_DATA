( Bloomberg ) --
The top U.S. cannabis companies are notably outperforming(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) The top U.S. cannabis companies struggling(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) Canadian counterparts , yet valuations are still held(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) back by The top U.S. cannabis companies inability to list(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) on the big American exchanges(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) .
The divergence was well illustrated(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) by two large companies that reported(#included Thursday night) earnings(#included Thursday night) Thursday night .
Green Thumb Industries Inc. became(#included Friday) the first U.S. pot company to generate(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) revenue above $ 100 million and beat(#included Friday) Ebitda expectations(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) for the fifth consecutive quarter .
Shares climbed(#included Friday) 17 % Friday .
Meanwhile , Canada ’s Aurora Cannabis Inc. , which is struggling to turn a profit before it runs out of cash , said(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) Canada ’s Aurora Cannabis Inc. , which is struggling to turn a profit before it runs out of cash , is on track to meet(#after 2020-05-18 09:34:05) previously disclosed(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) cost - cutting targets .
Shares skyrocketed(#included Friday) 54 % .
“ I think(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) this is an inflection point where the U.S. market is becoming(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) the dominant market in the global marijuana space , ” said(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) I .
“ I think(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) the only thing that ’s really keeping(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) these stocks from overtaking(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) the Canadian LPs is the fact that they ’re not listed(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) on the U.S. market . ”
While the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq have listed(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) Canadian cannabis companies like Aurora and Canopy Growth Corp. , the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq prohibit(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) any company with marijuana operations(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) in the U.S. since the drug is still illegal under federal law .
the New York Stock Exchange wo n’t list(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) Canadian cannabis companies like Aurora and Canopy Growth Corp. either , leaving(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) Canadian cannabis companies like Aurora and Canopy Growth Corp. to smaller bourses like the Canadian Securities Exchange .
list means a smaller investors base and therefore lower valuations on average .
To be sure , the U.S. market has actually outperformed(#included March 18) the Canadian sector since the market ’s pandemic - related low on March 18 .
Since March 18 , the Horizons US Marijuana Index ETF has gained(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) 94 % while the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF , which tracks(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) mainly Canadian companies , has added(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) 38 % .
“ For people putting(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) new money into the marijuana market , the Horizons US Marijuana Index ETF ’s going(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) into these stocks rather than the existing(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) , legacy LPs from Canada , ” I said(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) .
“ the Horizons US Marijuana Index ETF ’s a startling divergence , in I opinion . ”
While U.S. stocks have been bolstered(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) by most states ’ decision(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) to declare(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) marijuana an essential service during lockdowns(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05)
, Canadian companies have struggled(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) with an already - slow retail rollout in major provinces like Ontario , which has slowed(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) even further because of the pandemic(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) .
Total store count in Canada grew(#included April) just 1.4 % in April , according to Cowen analyst Vivien Azer .
“ Regardless of progress on cost cutting , if Ontario stores do not start(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) opening in the somewhat near future , industry revenues will not reach(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) the levels required(#overlap 2020-05-18 09:34:05) for most firms to reach(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) profitability , and we believe(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) Aurora is no different , ” CIBC analyst John Zamparo said(#before 2020-05-18 09:34:05) in a note .
