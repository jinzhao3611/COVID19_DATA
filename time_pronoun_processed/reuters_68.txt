The freeze(#included this year) comes(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) despite the fact that Brazil and China implemented(#included January) a new system in January intended to speed(#included early this year) up approvals(#included January) , said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry .
Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry tried(#included early this year) to get(#included early this year) in touch with Chinese counterparts early this year to begin(#included early this year) using(#included early this year) a new system , but at that time , as the coronavirus threat emerged(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) , China ’s General Administration of Customs ( GACC ) was not working(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) normally , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
Now that Brazil has been hit(#included Now) by the coronavirus pandemic , many public employees are working(#included Now) from home to avoid(#included Now) spreading(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) the novel coronavirus and associated(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) COVID-19 disease , preventing(#included Now) the necessary meetings to gain(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) new plant approvals(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
There is still good will on both sides , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry added(#included Monday) .
“ What is happening(#included Monday) is a case of temporary neglect(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
China was affected(#included Monday) first by COVID-19 and when China started(#included Monday) to get(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) back to normal , Brazil was affected(#included Monday) by COVID-19 , ” Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#included Monday) in a phone interview(#included Monday) late on Monday .
New approvals are n’t likely until Brazil ’s outbreak(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) eases(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) , which could take(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) months , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
China is the largest buyer(#overlap 2020-03-31 15:41:55) of Brazilian beef , pork and chicken .
Meat sales had been expected(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) to continue(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) rising(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) steadily amid the Asian swine fever , a disease that decimated(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) China ’s hog population and sent(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) China looking(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) abroad for pork and other alternative proteins .
Dozens of meatpacking facilities approved(#included last year) last year have already gained(#included last year) export permissions(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) and are not affected(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
Brazil announced(#included last year) Chinese approvals(#included January) for 25 new plants in September and 13 more in November .
a new system would allow(#included November) for China to conduct(#included November) “ virtual inspections ” of plants for export via remote video link , replacing(#included November) the previous need for a Chinese delegation to visit(#after 2020-03-31 15:41:55) plants in person .
a new system was first tested(#included 2019-09) in September .
“ The inspection by video conference was a total success(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
The Brazilians liked(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) The inspection by video conference ; the Chinese liked(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) The inspection by video conference , ” Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
But a new system still requires(#overlap 2020-03-31 15:41:55) many people on the Brazilian side from various departments , as well as translators , to be in a room together at the Brazilian ministry - and a similar gathering on the Chinese - along with a team on the ground at the meat inspection plant .
“ We ca n’t mobilize(#overlap 2020-03-31 15:41:55) a team to do a video conference(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) ...
a new system ’s a lot of people together in various places , which we ’re avoiding(#overlap 2020-03-31 15:41:55) at the moment ” to limit(#overlap 2020-03-31 15:41:55) the spread of the coronavirus pandemic , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) it was impossible to say(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) what impact the coronavirus pandemic would have(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) on the global market for Brazilian meat and if China would keep(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) buying(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) more .
“ There ’s a change in all patterns in consumption .
So in truth , Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry ca n’t tell(#overlap 2020-03-31 15:41:55) you how Chinese or global demand for meat will be , ” Orlando Leite Ribeiro , international affairs secretary at Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry said(#before 2020-03-31 15:41:55) .
