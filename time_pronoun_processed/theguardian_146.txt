England cricketers face(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) 'bio-secure' tests(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) in nine-week break from families .
2020-05-06 13:46:44 +00:00 .
England ’s Test cricketers have been told(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) to expect(#overlap 2020-05-06 13:46:44) daily temperature checks , regular Covid-19 swabs and possibly nine weeks away from England ’s Test cricketers families under ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played .
Joe Root ’s side had(#included 8 July) Joe Root ’s side first briefing(#included 8 July) about the “ bio - secure ” measures due to be in place this summer on Tuesday and learned(#included 8 July) that a squad of up to 30 could be chosen(#Depend-on 2020-05-06 13:46:44) for a run of six Tests at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford from 8 July .
While ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played is still fraught(#overlap 2020-05-06 13:46:44) with hurdles(#overlap 2020-05-06 13:46:44) and subject to guidelines for all sports being approved(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) by central government , there is a growing(#overlap 2020-05-06 13:46:44) belief at the England and Wales Cricket Board that the two grounds , with their on - site hotels , could see(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) the risk of playing(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) behind closed doors mitigated(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) to an acceptable level .
ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played would require(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) a huge commitment from the players , who would be asked to assemble at the Ageas Bowl on 23 June and may have to then stay(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) together until the proposed third Test against Pakistan at the end of August .
After initial testing(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) , the players , who would be asked to assemble at the Ageas Bowl on 23 June would spend(#Depend-on 2020-05-06 13:46:44) the first week training(#included 23 June) in small groups before an inter - squad match that serves(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) as a warm(#included 8 July) - up for the first Test against West Indies .
a squad of up to 30 would facilitate(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) spend , with the tourists playing(#included 8 July) the tourists practice(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) match either on one of the two pitches at the Ageas Bowl or a nearby club ground .
ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played will also give(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) England scope to rotate(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) their players during what will be a gruelling run of six Test matches in just over seven weeks – not least the fast bowlers , who will need their workloads managed – but a good number could spend this extended spell away from loved ones without actually winning a cap .
If infection rates drop(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) nationally there is a chance their players might be permitted(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) to return(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) home for a few days before the first Test against Pakistan – pencilled(#included 8 July) in for 5 August – but permitted may still require(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) relatives to isolate(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) for a spell ahead of relatives arrival(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) .
England are also hopeful of playing(#included 23 June) England ODI series against England during this brief window at the end of July , although any movement between the two squads is also likely to be subject to some form of quarantine(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) beforehand .
Preventing(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) physical contact(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) in the camp
is unrealistic given(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) the sport ’s dynamics but a squad of up to 30 will still be expected(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) to observe(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) the social distancing(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) instructions in place during a squad of up to 30 aborted(#included 8 July) tour(#included 8 July) of Sri Lanka in March , where handshakes were replaced(#included 8 July) by fist bumps and hygiene measures(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) were beefed(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) up .
As well as this there will be daily temperature checks(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) to screen(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) for Covid-19 symptoms and testing(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) every few days , while physical contact(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) with the outside world will be almost entirely cut(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) off .
Life in the so - called “ bubble ” has been described(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) as a scaled - up version of the PMOA , the restricted area at international matches that are policed(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) to prevent(#overlap 2020-05-06 13:46:44) would - be corrupters gaining(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) access .
To this end it is understood(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) that the skeleton staff who work at the two grounds and their adjoining hotels will operate(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) in small groups ; should one staff member go(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) down , colleagues who are in the same sub - team would also be taken(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) out of circulation and placed(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) under quarantine .
Overall ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played is a huge undertaking – one that looks(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) unlikely to be replicated(#before 2020-05-06 13:46:44) for domestic cricket – and remains(#overlap 2020-05-06 13:46:44) delicately poised .
But with forecasted(#included this summer) losses(#included this summer) of around £ 380 m in the event of no cricket this summer , the England and Wales Cricket Board is throwing(#included this summer) every resource possible at the project in the hope the project succeeds(#after 2020-05-06 13:46:44) .
