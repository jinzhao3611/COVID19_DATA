By David Gaffen ( Reuters ) - Energy traders bailed(#included Monday) out of the expiring May U.S. oil futures contract in a frenzy(#included Monday) on Monday , as the expiring May U.S. oil futures contract dropped(#included Monday) by more than 50 % to less than $ 8 a barrel and opening(#included Monday) the widest gap ever between it and the next contract with storage rapidly filling .
the widest gap ever between it and the next contract with storage rapidly filling has opened(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) because a glut of oil is heading(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) towards the United States while demand has dropped(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) by 30 % due to the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) .
While oil - producing nations have agreed(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) to cut(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) output and major global oil companies are also trimming(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) production(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) , cut will not come(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) quickly enough to avoid(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) a massive clog(#included May) in the next couple of weeks .
As a result , futures traders , who would normally be able to shift(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) from the expiring May U.S. oil futures contract to the next , are finding(#included May) few buyers for the expiring May U.S. oil futures contract to take(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) delivery of barrels .

arrive may prove(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) to be one of the worst deliveries in history .
Nobody wants(#included right now) or is in need of oil right now , " said(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago .

When a futures contract expires(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) , traders must decide(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) whether to take(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) delivery or roll traders positions into an upcoming(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) contract .
Usually this process is relatively uncomplicated , but the expiring May U.S. oil futures contract decline(#included May) reflects(#included May) worries that too much supply could hit(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) the markets , with shipments out of OPEC nations like Saudi Arabia booked(#included May) in March set(#included May) to cause(#included right now) a glut .
The world 's major oil producers agreed(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) to cut(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) production(#included right now) by 9.7 million bpd in an attempt to get(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) world supply under control as demand slumps(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) , but cut do not begin(#included right now) until May. Saudi Arabia is ramping(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) up deliveries of oil , including(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) big shipments to the United States .
Meanwhile , available storage space is dropping(#included right now) fast at the Cushing , Oklahoma hub , where physical delivery of U.S. oil barrels bought in the futures market takes place .

" It ’s clear that the Cushing , Oklahoma hub , where physical delivery of U.S. oil barrels bought in the futures market takes place is going(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) to fill(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) and the Cushing , Oklahoma hub , where physical delivery of U.S. oil barrels bought in the futures market takes place will stay(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) full for the next several months , " said(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates .
" Because producers have been lagging(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) in their production cuts we ’re seeing(#included June) an overwhelming amount of crude oil looking(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) for a place to go(#after 2020-04-20 17:07:23) around The world 's . "
Worldwide oil consumption is roughly 100 million barrels a day , and supply generally stays(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) in line with roughly 100 million barrels a day .
But consumption is down about 30 % globally , and their production cuts so far are far less .
U.S. exchange - traded funds are also playing(#overlap 2020-04-20 17:07:23) a role in bailed , analysts said(#before 2020-04-20 17:07:23) .
