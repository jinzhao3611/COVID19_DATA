Starting(#included Monday , April 27 , 2020) Slow for a Busy Week .
2020-04-27 15:07:55 +00:00 .
Monday , April 27 , 2020 We start(#included Monday , April 27 , 2020) off slowly in our new trading week , especially considering(#overlap 2020-04-27 15:07:55) We will be getting(#after 2020-04-27 15:07:55) Q1 earnings results from no fewer than 150 companies listed(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) on the SP 500 , as well as 1/3 of the Dow Jones .
We are currently in the heart of earnings season , though the marquee names do n’t begin(#before tomorrow) reporting(#included currently) until tomorrow .
When We do see(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) the marquee names — We know(#included currently) that the past quarter figures are less important than what June quarter projections(#included June quarter) are .
Many companies that have already reported(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) have erased(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) any future guidance , if not for the next quarter than for full - year 2020 .
We will take(#after 2020-04-27 15:07:55) incoming data on a company - by - company basis , and by the end of our new trading week will have(#included the past quarter) a strong view on earnings season overall .
A few things to look(#after 2020-04-27 15:07:55) for include(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) : Apple AAPL delaying(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) the production(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) of a new iPhone by roughly a month , Amazon AMZN and Alphabet ( Google ) to potentially have outperformed(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) during this “ shelter in place ” period to combat(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus , and whether Microsoft ’s MSFT Xbox Live was as strong as some analysts forecast .
In short , We have(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) plenty of scenarios to look(#after 2020-04-27 15:07:55) forward to as our new trading week progresses(#included currently) .
We also do n’t see(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) much in the way of economic data for our new trading week .
We do get(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) Q2 GDP , jobless claims and manufacturing reads(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) from PMI and ISM later in our new trading week , but We will need(#after 2020-04-27 15:07:55) to wait(#after 2020-04-27 15:07:55) a week for new Employment Situation data and a fresh Unemployment Rate .
Then again , as depressing as those reads no doubt will be , nobody is clamoring(#overlap 2020-04-27 15:07:55) for those reads to come(#included currently) out right now .
So what We see(#included currently) this morning is more hopefulness buoying(#included currently) market futures — pre - market indexes are in the green across the board : the Dow Jones is up 220 points , the Nasdaq +100 and the SP 500 +20 .
No news is good news , as they say(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) .
And as long as coronavirus statistics continue(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) to display(#overlap 2020-04-27 15:07:55) a plateauing or downward slope in new cases and/or fatalities(#before 2020-04-27 15:07:55) , we can expect(#included Monday , April 27 , 2020) these would contribute(#included the week) to the current sentiment , as well .
