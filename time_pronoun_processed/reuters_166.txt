International Olympic Committee member John Coates learned(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) the importance of the independence of the AOC when International Olympic Committee member John Coates was a leading(#included 2017) advocate of the AOC ’s decision(#included 1980) to send(#included 1980) a team to the 1980 Moscow Olympics in the face of opposition(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) from the Australian government , who were backing(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) calls for a boycott(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) .
That history and International Olympic Committee member John Coates strong loyalty to the Olympic movement suggests(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) that Monday ’s AOC statement was less a boycott(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) threat than early recognition of an inevitable postponement(#before 2020-03-24 08:48:47) .
