LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil prices fell(#included Monday) on Monday on worries that a global oil glut may persist(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) even as coronavirus pandemic lockdowns(#overlap 2020-05-04 14:16:14) start to ease(#overlap 2020-05-04 14:16:14) and amid a fresh spat(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) between the United States and China over the origin of the virus .

While global oil demand is expected(#included the coming weeks) to recover(#included the coming weeks) modestly from April lows as countries ease(#included the coming weeks) some lockdown(#overlap 2020-05-04 14:16:14) measures(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) , a global oil glut will loom(#after 2020-05-04 14:16:14) over the markets .
“ As oil inventories are likely still increasing(#included the coming weeks) over the coming weeks , oil prices remain(#overlap 2020-05-04 14:16:14) vulnerable to renewed(#Depend-on 2020-05-04 14:16:14) setbacks(#included the coming weeks) , ” said(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo .
However , Goldman Sachs was more optimistic than before about the rise(#included next year) of oil prices next year due to lower crude production(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) and a partial recovery in oil demand .

Signs that the output cuts(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) may help(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) reduce(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) the supply overhang have emerged(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) with the narrowing(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) of global benchmark Brent ’s contango - the market structure in which later - dated prices are higher than prompt supplies .

The re(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) - emergence of trade(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) tensions between the United States and China also weighed(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) on prices .
Adding(#included last week) to U.S. President Donald Trump ’s threat last week to impose(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) tariffs on China , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said(#included Monday) on Sunday there was “ a significant amount of evidence ” that the new coronavirus emerged(#included Monday) from a Chinese laboratory .
“ Demand projections have sobered(#included Monday) up last week ’s enthusiasm and this , together with the prospect of new U.S.-China trade(#after 2020-05-04 14:16:14) tensions , have weighted(#included Monday) heavily on prices today , ” said(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) Rystad ’s senior oil markets analyst Paola Rodriguez - Masiu .
Oil prices recovered(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) some of Oil prices losses(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expected(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) China to make(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) good on China trade(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) agreement(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) with the United States .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expected(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) oil markets to rebound(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) , and that the U.S. President Donald Trump administration was looking(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) for more storage capacity .
Concerns about weak manufacturing data in Asia and Europe , assessed(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) by Purchasing Managers ’ Index ( PMI ) of manufacturing companies , also put(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) pressure on oil prices .

The U.S. dollar surged(#included Monday) against most major currencies on Monday amid fears(#included March) that last year ’s U.S.-China dispute(#included late - March) will be re(#included late - March) .
Oil is usually priced(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) in dollars so a stronger greenback makes(#before 2020-05-04 14:16:14) crude more expensive for buyers with other currencies .
