the coronavirus pandemic , which is leading to lower revenue from sports customers , reduced business activity and more cautious spending from multinational customers will also help(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) fund(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) a 12 billion pound ( $ 15 billion ) plan to upgrade(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) its legacy copper network to full fibre .
If the conditions are right , BT said(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) BT could reach(#included the mid to late 2020s) 20 million premises by the mid to late 2020s , 5 million more than BT had targeted(#included November 15 , 2019) .
On the day rivals Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) and Liberty Global ( LBTYA.O ) announced(#included the) plans to merger(#included November 15 , 2019) rivals Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) and Liberty Global ( LBTYA.O ) British units to build(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) a stronger challenger , BT also set(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) out plans for a new five - year programme to modernise(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) the business .
Chief Executive Philip Jansen said(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) the coronavirus pandemic , which is leading to lower revenue from sports customers , reduced business activity and more cautious spending from multinational customers , had brought(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) BT ’s national leadership in telecoms into the sharpest focus in BT ’s history , and while upgrading(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) its legacy copper network had been important before , the coronavirus pandemic , which is leading to lower revenue from sports customers , reduced business activity and more cautious spending from multinational customers was now “ a matter of extreme urgency ” .
Therefore , its dividend had to be pulled(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) .
“ pulled was a tough decision(#included the) , but although hard on shareholders , a necessary one so that we can allocate(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) capital for value - enhancing investments(#included November 15 , 2019) , ” Chief Executive Philip Jansen told(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) reporters .

Chief Executive Philip Jansen said(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) the impact of the coronavirus pandemic , which is leading to lower revenue from sports customers , reduced business activity and more cautious spending from multinational customers would only become(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) clearer as the economic consequences(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) unfolded(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) over the next 12 months .

BT ’s new efficiency programme will cost(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) 1.3 billion pounds to achieve(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) , but will deliver(#included March 2025) annualised gross benefits of 2 billion pounds by March 2025 as BT ’s new efficiency programme switches(#before 2020-05-07 08:45:24) off many legacy programmes(#overlap 2020-05-07 08:45:24) and uses(#included March 2025) new technologies to improve(#after 2020-05-07 08:45:24) .
