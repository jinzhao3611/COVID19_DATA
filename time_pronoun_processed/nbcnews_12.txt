Officials are facing(#overlap 2020-03-31 02:30:34) criticism for using(#included 2020-04-04) a Vegas parking lot as a temporary shelter after a facility was closed(#included 2020-W13) when a homeless man tested(#included 2020-W13) positive for COVID-19 last week .
Officials from Vegas and Clark County opened(#included 2020-04-04) a temporary shelter at an event site lot a few miles north of Vegas on Saturday after determining(#included 2020-04-04) that 500 people using Catholic Charities ' overnight facility would have(#after 2020-03-31 02:30:34) nowhere to sleep(#before 2020-03-31 02:30:34) , said(#before 2020-03-31 02:30:34) David Riggleman , the city ’s communications director .
