Hospital investigates(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) death(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) of NHS doctor who pleaded(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) for PPE .
2020-04-29 16:54:18 +00:00 .
A hospital has launched(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) an investigation(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) into the death of one of its doctors from Covid-19 shortly after he pleaded in vain for him and his colleagues to be given protective equipment .
The Royal Berkshire NHS trust has begun(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) a serious incident investigation after one of its doctors from Covid-19 , died(#included 13 April) on 13 April .
Using(#included last week) emails shared by his son Michael , the Guardian revealed(#included last week) last week how one of its doctors from Covid-19 asked(#included 23 March) managers at the hospital in Reading on 23 March to ensure(#included last week) him and his colleagues had(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) personal protective equipment ( PPE ) to reduce(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the risk of being infected(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) with coronavirus .
one of its doctors from Covid-19 appeals(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) were rebuffed(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) because one of its doctors from Covid-19 did not have(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) any suspected or confirmed(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) cases of Covid-19 on one of its doctors from Covid-19 unit .
died has generated(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) substantial publicity with both Tun ’s brother Ye Myint – an NHS consultant – and his son Michael criticising(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the trust ’s failure to provide(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) PPE , amid a dispute(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) over whether The Royal Berkshire NHS trust was correctly applying(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the guidance on protective kit .
his son Michael said(#included last week) last week : “ When a doctor of 40 years ’ experience has had to literally beg(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) for surgical masks , and beg is denied(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) , something has gone(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) seriously wrong .
his son Michael think(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) that died was avoidable and that that probability would have been reduced(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) if my dad had had(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) proper personal protective equipment . ”
a serious incident investigation is being undertaken(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) by a group of senior doctors and managers at the Reading hospital , which has informed(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the family of the investigation and offered(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the family of the investigation condolences .
A spokesperson for The Royal Berkshire NHS trust said(#included last week) : “ The Royal Berkshire NHS trust can confirm(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) a serious incident investigation has been launched(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) .
a serious incident investigation involves(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) senior managers and clinicians who are working closely with Dr Tun ’s family to look(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) at senior managers and clinicians who are working closely with Dr Tun ’s family concerns(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) and answer(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) senior managers and clinicians who are working closely with Dr Tun ’s family questions .
Whilst this is ongoing , The Royal Berkshire NHS trust are unable to say(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) any more . ”
A source at the hospital in Reading said(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) : “ The Royal Berkshire NHS trust need(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) to get to the bottom of the death of one of its doctors from Covid-19 shortly after he pleaded in vain for him and his colleagues to be given protective equipment .
one of its doctors from Covid-19 was the first member of staff that The Royal Berkshire NHS trust have lost(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) .
That , plus the nature of died , means it ’s important to do the death of one of its doctors from Covid-19 shortly after he pleaded in vain for him and his colleagues to be given protective equipment properly , so that the family get(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) what the family need(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) to hear(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) . ”
However , it is unclear(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) whether a serious incident investigation will look(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) at the availability of PPE within the hospital in Reading or just the trust ’s application of Public Health England ’s ( PHE )
guidelines on PPE at the time one of its doctors from Covid-19 sent(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) emails shared by his son Michael .
emails shared by his son Michael were strengthened(#included requesting) soon after .
One member of staff with knowledge of a serious incident investigation said(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) : “ a serious incident investigation will look(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) at the guidance on protective kit at the time .
But a serious incident investigation wo n’t look(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) at the supply of PPE in The Royal Berkshire NHS trust at the time . ”
The Royal Berkshire NHS trust is also considering(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) whether The Royal Berkshire NHS trust may have to report(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) died to the Health and Safety Executive to look(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) into whether died involved(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) any breaches of an employer ’s duty to protect(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) their staff .
An official from the office of the coroner for Berkshire has also contacted(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) one of its doctors from Covid-19 , raising(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the possibility that the events surrounding(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) died will be explored(#after 2020-04-29 16:54:18) in a public forum .
Dr Claudia Paoloni , the president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association , said(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) : “ It ’s very sad that one of its doctors from Covid-19 has died(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) after requesting(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) PPE .
a serious incident investigation highlights(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) the need for all healthcare workers in all healthcare settings to have(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) PPE at all times , to keep(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) healthcare workers safe .
“ At the time one of its doctors from Covid-19 sent(#before 2020-04-29 16:54:18) one of its doctors from Covid-19 emails , various medical royal colleges and the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association were raising(#overlap 2020-04-29 16:54:18) concerns with The Royal Berkshire NHS trust about the weaknesses with the guidance on protective kit . ”
