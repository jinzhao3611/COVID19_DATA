" While millions of Americans in New York are left without income , with the present budget crisis(#overlap 2020-05-02 01:09:35) , at the very least our Albany Leaders should have set(#before 2020-05-02 01:09:35) the example and put(#before 2020-05-02 01:09:35) the raises on hold , " Vic Furman , president of the Land Owner Advocates of New York added(#before 2020-05-02 01:09:35) in a written statement .
