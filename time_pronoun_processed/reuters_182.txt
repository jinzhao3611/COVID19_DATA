“ Usain Bolt recommendation(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) would be to postpone(#before 2021) Tokyo Olympics until next year , ” his coach Glen Mills told(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) Reuters in a telephone interview(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) .
“ postpone would be unprecedented , but we are in unprecedented time .
Move(#after 2020-03-21 01:21:51) everything up one year and then everything will eventually fall(#after 2020-03-21 01:21:51) back in place .
“ But Usain Bolt do n’t think(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) that Tokyo Olympics will take(#after 2020-03-21 01:21:51) place at the time that is specified(#before 2021) ( July and August ) because the outbreak is worldwide and in some countries , the outbreak is just starting(#overlap 2020-03-21 01:21:51) to accelerate(#overlap 2020-03-21 01:21:51) .
“ Usain Bolt ca n’t see(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) Tokyo Olympics going(#included June 27 , 2009) ahead ; taking(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) persons from all over the world and bringing(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) persons from all over the world to one central point . ”
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and Tokyo organisers have maintained(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) that Tokyo Olympics should go(#included July 24) ahead as scheduled(#included July 24) to start(#included July 24) on July 24 .
his coach Glen Mills said(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) his current athletes at the Racers Track Club have been unable to train(#included July) since Wednesday .
unable was due to measures taken(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) by the Jamaican Health Ministry , including(#included June 27 , 2009) the closure of training tracks and gyms .
“ Right now the important thing is for his current athletes at the Racers Track Club to isolate(#included current) his current athletes at the Racers Track Club and follow(#included current) social distancing , ” his coach Glen Mills said(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) .
“ his current athletes at the Racers Track Club have been instructed(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) to do whatever exercises(#overlap 2020-03-21 01:21:51) his current athletes at the Racers Track Club can do at home
and if his current athletes at the Racers Track Club have(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) any open spaces to exercise(#overlap 2020-03-21 01:21:51) until the training facilities reopen(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) and then we can re(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) proper training . ”
The virus will likely have(#after 2020-03-21 01:21:51) a huge economic impact for athletes given(#overlap 2020-03-21 01:21:51) the anticipated(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) cancellation(#included July 24) and postponement(#after Wednesday) of meetings during the outdoor season , his coach Glen Mills added(#before 2020-03-21 01:21:51) .
