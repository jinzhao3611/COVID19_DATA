Coronavirus: 'What's coming(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) is extremely big' - UK consultant says(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) outbreak(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) could be worse than in Italy .
2020-03-20 19:41:51 +00:00 .
The UK 's coronavirus outbreak could be worse than Italy and hospitals may be " completely swamped(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) " , an AE consultant has told(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) Sky News .
The Italian system is " in advance of us in terms of resources and the intensive care beds " , an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) , and it could be days until some hospitals reach(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) capacity and patients begin(#after 2020-03-20 19:41:51) spilling(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) out into corridors .
The medic , who works on the front line at a south London hospital and wanted to stay anonymous , said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) COVID-19 had been " described(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) as the flu " but " really is n't - not the way we are seeing(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) the flu " .
The medic , who works on the front line at a south London hospital and wanted to stay anonymous said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) people were coming(#included he) in with " full - blown , really nasty pneumonia " .
The only way to get(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) control of The UK 's coronavirus outbreak is through a " fairly strict lockdown " , The medic , who works on the front line at a south London hospital and wanted to stay anonymous said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) , warning(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) that " somebody you know(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) " is likely to be affected(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
" We know(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) what 's coming(#included he) , and We know(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) what 's coming(#included he) is extremely big , " The medic , who works on the front line at a south London hospital and wanted to stay anonymous said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
He and his colleagues will have to make(#after 2020-03-20 19:41:51) life and death decisions , allocating(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) resources " only to those deemed(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) most likely to survive(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) " .
It is something The medic , who works on the front line at a south London hospital and wanted to stay anonymous suspects(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) will " haunt(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) " He and his colleagues afterwards .
In 30 years as a medical practitioner , an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) an AE consultant had never seen(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) anything like It .
an AE consultant accused(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) the government of not listening(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) and having(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) a " falsely placed(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) sense of optimism that it will all work(#after 2020-03-20 19:41:51) out " .
Mass coronavirus testing(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) is needed(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) , an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) , because self - isolation guidelines are " wreaking(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) havoc " .
" We are losing(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) ( hospital staff ) who are otherwise well , " an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
an AE consultant has seen(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) Sky News report(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) from the main hospital in Bergamo , northern Italy , where we found people in terrible distress , gasping for air .
Asked(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) whether an AE consultant is worried(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) that the main hospital in Bergamo , northern Italy , where we found people in terrible distress , gasping for air could look like that , an AE consultant said(#included right now) : " Yes , an AE consultant do - an AE consultant actually think(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) it could be worse than that . "
an AE consultant added(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) : " an AE consultant 'm aware of The Italian system , and an AE consultant think(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) in quite a few ways The Italian system are in advance of us in terms of resources and the intensive care beds The Italian system had available prior to this occurring(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
" So an AE consultant think(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) us may actually end(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) up in a worse state than The Italian system presently are unless us take(#included right now) sufficient measures right now . "
Asked(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) if an AE consultant had(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) enough resources , an AE consultant said(#included right now) : " In terms of what we 're anticipating(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) , the honest truth is no .
" The NHS is n't currently set(#included right now) up to ventilator(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) a huge number of people . "

Nor are there " sufficient numbers of staff trained(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) in actually managing(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) patients on ventilatory support " .
That is " not something you can just teach(#included right now) in an afternoon seminar " , an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
There is not enough protective equipment ( PPE ) either .
After watching(#included right now) the report(#included right now) from Italy , an AE consultant said(#included right now) : " an AE consultant look(#included right now) at the pictures and an AE consultant can see(#included right now) the pictures staff are in full PPE material - that is not occurring(#included right now) right now in The UK 's .
" an AE consultant see(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) that the pictures have got(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) quite a lot of additional ventilators and other machinery which the pictures are able to bring(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) down into the pictures emergency departments .
" the pictures have got(#overlap 2020-03-20 19:41:51) sufficient for the pictures intensive care and recovery areas at present . "
The worst case scenario , an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) , is when intensive care overflow areas become(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) full too , and patients begin(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) spilling(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) out into corridors .
" spilling 's what you are seeing(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) in Italy , " an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
At that stage , only the patients thought most likely to survive will be allocated(#after 2020-03-20 19:41:51) the full resources .
Others , with additional medical problems , will not receive(#after 2020-03-20 19:41:51) only the patients thought most likely to survive .
" an AE consultant think(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) you will then see(#after 2020-03-20 19:41:51) a really steep rise(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) in mortality , " an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
an AE consultant added(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) that people " do n't stop(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) having(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) heart attacks , people do n't stop(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) having(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) strokes , but the resources will not be there for people " .
It is " actually quite horrifying to think(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) that we could be completely swamped(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) " , an AE consultant said(#before 2020-03-20 19:41:51) .
