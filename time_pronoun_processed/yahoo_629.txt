Why the largest-ever Arctic ozone hole just closed(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) .
2020-05-01 12:08:58 +00:00 .
the largest-ever Arctic ozone hole has closed(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) , according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ( CAMS ) .
And the largest-ever Arctic ozone hole beginning and end have(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) nothing to do with climate change , global warming or a reduction(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) in air pollution because of the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) .
It has to do simply with the weather .
the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ( CAMS ) monitored(#included this spring) the largest-ever Arctic ozone hole .
Ozone holes are more common over the Antarctic every year , according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ( CAMS ) , but " the conditions needed(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) for such strong ozone depletion are not normally found(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) in the Northern Hemisphere . "
The Arctic stratosphere is usually less isolated(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) than The Arctic stratosphere the Antarctic counterpart because the presence of nearby land masses and mountain ranges disturbs(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) the weather patterns more than in the Northern Hemisphere , the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ( CAMS ) reports(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) .

This year , however , a particularly strong polar vortex led(#included This year) to the largest-ever Arctic ozone hole , according to CNN .
The last time such a strong depletion was observed(#included this spring) in the Arctic was almost a decade ago .
So , why did it occur(#included this year) This year ?
" The behavior of the ozone and the stratospheric polar vortex during the winter into spring is supported(#included PRESENT_REF) by a couple of research papers , " said(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Bob Smerbeck .
" AccuWeather state(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) that the coldest and strongest polar vortex in the stratosphere and the lowest concentration of ozone over the Arctic are more likely to occur(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) when you have(#included PRESENT_REF) a combination of a solar minimum , which we are in now , and a westerly QBO [ quasi - biennial oscillation , meaning lower stratospheric westerly winds over the equator ] , which we had from last summer through most of this winter .
" the coldest and strongest polar vortex in the stratosphere and the lowest concentration of ozone over the Arctic are all naturally occurring(#overlap 2020-05-01 12:08:58) processes , " AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Bob Smerbeck said(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) .

A polar vortex that remained(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) above the Arctic without weakening(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) and a strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) were among a combination of factors(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) that led(#included December 2019) the contiguous U.S. to experience(#included December 2019) higher - than - normal temperatures from December 2019 through February 2020 .
" When you have(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) a strong polar vortex that remains in the polar region , a strong polar vortex that remains in the polar region tends(#overlap 2020-05-01 12:08:58) to keep(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) frigid air pent up so that it is difficult for long - lasting outbreaks(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) of frigid conditions to reach(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) the middle latitudes , including(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) portions of the Midwest and Northeast , " said(#before 2020-05-01 12:08:58) AccuWeather Lead Long - Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok .
