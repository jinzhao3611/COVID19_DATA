Until recently , Airbnb resisted(#before recently) issuing(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) refunds(#before recently) to its guests , largely leaving(#before recently) the decision(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) up to its hosts .
Airbnb refunds(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) were only guaranteed(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) to a select list of countries on a list .
Just a day before , Airbnb had updated(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) its cancellation policy to apply(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) to bookings made(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) in the United States as well as Mainland China , South Korea , and Italy .
But as the coronavirus pandemic has swept(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) across the world , and infected(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) more than 153,000 people , more countries have gone(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) into lockdown(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) .
In tweeted , Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky commended(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) its hosts have already independently been giving(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) guests refunds(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) , and added(#included today) that Airbnb would be thinking(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) of ways to support(#after 2020-03-15 01:13:45) Airbnb hosts whose incomes may take(#after 2020-03-15 01:13:45) a hit amid the flurry of reservation cancellations(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) .
" Second , its hosts have acted(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) like heroes during this time .

Airbnb bookings have already taken(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) a hit as a slew of cancelled(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) events because of the coronavirus pandemic have prompted(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) people to delay(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) or cancel(#before 2020-03-15 01:13:45) travel plans .
