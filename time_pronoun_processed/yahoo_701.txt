Analysts said(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) Brent crude , the international benchmark , turned(#included Tuesday) sharply lower on Tuesday as the market realised(#included Tuesday) that even sharp production(#included any) cuts - ordered(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) by the so - called Opec+ group of oil - producing nations from next month - would still mean(#after 2020-04-22 12:58:45) far more oil would be pumped(#after 2020-04-22 12:58:45) than is needed(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) for a saturated market .

Lord Browne , the former BP chief executive , told(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) Sky 's Ian King Live that given(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) the " huge " levels of oil stockpiles Lord Browne , the former BP chief executive , would expect(#included May) prices " to remain(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) sluggish for quite some time " .
Lord Browne , the former BP chief executive , acknowledged(#included May) that a potentially lengthy period of weakness in the market could have(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) major geopolitical consequences as countries which are dependent on it have to " cut(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) countries which are dependent on it cloth "

Despite the dive in oil costs , there may be little change(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) to prices on UK forecourts for motorists - the few using their vehicles .
The RAC said(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) there was scope for unleaded costs to fall(#after 2020-04-22 12:58:45) to levels not seen(#after 2015) since 2015 .
The RAC fuel spokesman , Simon Williams , added(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) : " It 's right that retailers charge(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) a fair price for fuel that reflects(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) the price of the raw product , and in theory petrol prices could fall(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) below Â£ 1 per litre if the lower wholesale costs were reflected(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) at the pumps .
" But at the same time people are driving(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) very few miles so people 're selling(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) vastly lower quantities of petrol and diesel at the moment .
selling means many will be at pains to trim(#after 2020-04-22 12:58:45) many prices any further .
" The RAC also continue(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) to be concerned(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) about smaller forecourts that provide(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) a vital service in areas where the supermarkets do n't have(#overlap 2020-04-22 12:58:45) a foothold as many are already finding(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) conditions tough with sales having fallen(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) off a cliff since lockdown(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) .
" It would be bad news all round if these forecourts shut(#before 2020-04-22 12:58:45) up shop for good . "
