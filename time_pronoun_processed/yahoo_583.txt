In March , Britain was forced(#included 2020-03) to stop(#included 2020-03) registrations(#included 2020-03) from new customers and impose(#included 2020-03) a queuing system online after Britain saw(#included 2020-03) a several hundred percentage increase(#included 2020-03) in web traffic .
" It took(#before 2020-05-06 10:42:02) Britain a few weeks to adapt(#before 2020-05-06 10:42:02) to a completely new situation , and I know(#before 2020-05-06 10:42:02) Britain did n’t serve(#before 2020-05-06 10:42:02) Britain customers as well as Britain ’d liked(#before 2020-05-06 10:42:02) ( to ) , " finance chief Duncan Tatton - Brown told(#before 2020-05-06 10:42:02) reporters .
