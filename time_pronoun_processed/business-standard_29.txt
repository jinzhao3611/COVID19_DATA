India 's coal stocks breached(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) 100 million tonne ( mt ) as power demand weakened(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) , leading(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to lower coal sales since the outbreak(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) of the novel Coal India officials said(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) Coal India continues(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to produce(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) around 2.5 mt of coal daily , but less than 2 mt was dispatched(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to the power sector in the past 15 days which led stocks to pile up drastically in Coal India pitheads .
While the coal stocks in Coal India peaked(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to around 60 mt , coal stocks in power plants rose(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to 41.41 mt – the highest ever inventory level in India 's till date .
Despite the overstock situation , coal output had peaked(#included 2020-03-20) to a new high of 3.17 mt on 20 March 2020 - the highest ever single day production so far - overtaking(#included 2020-03-20) the 3.14 mt production(#included 2020-03-25) recorded(#included 2020-03-25) on 25 March 2020 .
Officials estimate(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) that another 4 mt-5 mt of stock will be piled(#included 2020-03) up at the pitheads by the end of the month .
Before the Covid-19 outbreak in the country , around 4.5 mt of stocks was getting(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) added(#included 2020-03) every month on the average , however , in 20 March 2020 , the net stock addition is expected(#included 2020-03) to be around 11 - 12 mt .
“ It is happening(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) because of a cascading(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) effect .
Lower industrial activity results(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) in lower demand for power which in turn leads(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to lower(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) coal demand ” , a senior Coal India official said(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) .
In fact , during the first 15 days of the month , when the scare(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) around Covid-19 surfaced(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) , electricity consumption stood(#included 2020-03-20) at 51 billion units ( BU ) which is 3.6 per cent lower than the demand in the same period in 2019 .
According to data from Central Electricity Authority , the is enough(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) for plants to produce(#after 2020-03-24 11:39:55) power for 24 days without any supply from Coal India .
Company sources suggested(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) that power demand , until the first week of March had grown(#included 2020-03) on a year - on - year basis , but power demand started(#included 2020-03) to decline(#included 2020-03) thereafter .
a senior Coal India official suggested(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) that measures to contain(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) the Covid-19 outbreak in the country , included(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) work(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) from home , implying(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) lower power demand from offices as well as schools , colleges , malls , cinema screens , parks and other public places shutting(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) down temporarily .
" Now with the lockdown(#included 2020-03) in place , demand for power is expected(#after 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to go(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) down further and hence the demand for coal as well ” , a senior Coal India official said(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) .
Despite the Covid-19 outbreak in the country , Coal India has n’t suspended(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) mining operations(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) as Coal India feels(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) production and supply lines of coal needs(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to be kept(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) open so that power generation remains(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) unaffected and any exigency(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) can be addressed(#after 2020-03-24 11:39:55) .
According to a Central Coalfields Ltd ( CCL - a Coal India subsidiary ) official , almost all power plants linked(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to CCL are directly or indirectly refusing(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to accept(#overlap 2020-03-24 11:39:55) more coal supply .
“ The hurdles(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) faced(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) by CCL have reached(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) to an unprecedented level , so much so that the power consumers have stopped(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) making(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) payments ”
, a senior Coal India official said(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) .
On the other hand , Coal India has suspended(#included 2020-04-01) calculation(#included 2019) of Coal India annual stock measurement(#included 2020-04-01) from April 1 to April 15 after the Centre and several state governments enforced(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) mandatory travel(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) restrictions(#before 2020-03-24 11:39:55) .
