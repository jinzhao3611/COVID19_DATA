Two studies have raised(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) further alarm about deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) in Brazil during the first year of the far - right president Jair Bolsonaro ’s government .
One study showed(#included last year) Brazil lost(#included last year) 12,000 km2 ( 4,633 sq miles ) of forest last year and also provided(#included last year) important information about those behind deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) .
The other research(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) flagged(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) a 27 % increase(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) in the destruction(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) of tropical forests in eastern Brazil .

Amazon deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) and fires have soared(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) since Bolsonaro took(#included January 2019) office in January 2019 , vowing(#included the first year) to end(#included January 2019) the “ fines industry ” of environment agencies and develop(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) the rainforest .
“ We need(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) to make an effort while We are in a quiet moment for press coverage(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) because they only talk(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) about Covid , ” the environment minister , Ricardo Salles , said(#included Friday) in a ministerial meeting in April .
Video of a ministerial meeting in April was released(#included Friday) on Friday and showed(#included Friday) the environment minister , Ricardo Salles , using(#included Friday) an expression about cattle to push(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) for “ changing(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) all the rules and simplifying(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) norms ” .
Environmentalists had warned(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) that changing was what Brazil had been doing .
“ The government ’s position is weaken policies and weaken increases(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) , ” said(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) Mariana Mota , a public policy specialist at Greenpeace Brasil .
“ The deforestation numbers do n’t lie(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) . ”
The first annual study by MapBiomas – a coalition of NGOs , universities and technology companies – confirmed(#included Friday) deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) alerts(#included Friday) from Brazil ’s Space Research Institute with high resolution images .
The first annual study by MapBiomas – a coalition of NGOs , universities and technology companies – found(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) 7,700km2 of the deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) was in Amazon .
More than three - quarters happened(#included 15 May) on land registered(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) via a self - registration system Brazilian farmers use(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) to claim(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) ownership - and 99 % of deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) was illegal(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) , MapBiomas – a coalition of NGOs , universities and technology companies found(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) .
Brazil is trying(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) to approve(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) a law that would allow(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) farmers who had illegally occupied(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) land on protected(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) reserves before a cutoff date to claim(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) legal title , legislation environmentalists have called(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) the “ land grabbers ” bill . Brazil ’s vice - president , Gen Hamilton Mourão , leads(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) an “ Amazon council ” and an environmental operation by thousands of Brazilian soldiers whose effectiveness has been questioned by local media .
On 15 May Brazil ’s vice - president , Gen Hamilton Mourão said(#included Friday) the “ land grabbers ” bill would help(#included the first year) Brazil fight(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) deforestation .
“ [ If ] Brazil do not know(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) who owns(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) the land , Brazil can not bring(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) [ anybody ] to justice , ” Brazil ’s vice - president , Gen Hamilton Mourão said(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) .

The first annual study by MapBiomas – a coalition of NGOs , universities and technology companies – shows(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) Brazil already knows(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) who is responsible for deforestation(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) .
The issue is not finding(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) the offenders , The issue is that fines(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) are often ignored(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) .
A study by Human Rights Watch shows(#overlap 2020-05-28 05:07:25) that Amazon fines have been suspended(#after October) since October after the introduction(#included October 2018) of new procedures(#before 2020-05-28 05:07:25) by Brazil .
