They got(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) no response , according to Sanjeev Relhan and Rajiv Nath , the heads of two health - sector manufacturing associations .
Sanjeev Relhan and Rajiv Nath , the heads of two health - sector manufacturing associations and other manufacturers now say(#included PRESENT_REF) such poor communication led(#included PRESENT_REF) to the squandering(#included PRESENT_REF) of precious time in the race to protect(#included PRESENT_REF) health workers fighting(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) the coronavirus .
the health ministry did not respond(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) to multiple requests(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) for comment(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
India has reported(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) 724 cases of the coronavirus including(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:44:39) 17 deaths(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has locked(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) down India for three weeks in the world ’s most ambitious bid to control(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) the epidemic(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
Sanjeev Relhan said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) they met(#included March 16) textile ministry officials on March 16 , only to learn(#included March 16) equipment specifications had already been set(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
Then , on Saturday , Rajiv Nath , the heads of two health - sector manufacturing associations said(#included Saturday) Rajiv Nath , the heads of two health - sector manufacturing associations was informed(#included Saturday) by a health ministry official that a tender for the equipment had been issued(#included March 13) 16 days earlier , but many manufacturers had not been aware of a tender for the equipment .
“ We sent(#included March 25 , 2020) daily emails from March 13 until March 21 .
If a tender for the equipment was available(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) why did n’t they share(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) a tender for the equipment ? ” said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) Relhan , chair of the Preventive Wear Manufacturer Association of India .
India banned(#included Jan. 31) exports of personal protective equipment on March 21 to avoid(#included March 16) shortages but other manufacturers of the equipment rued(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) what other manufacturers of the equipment saw(#included March 16) as a waste of time in getting(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:44:39) ready to face(#included PRESENT_REF) the coronavirus .
“ If We were preparing(#included March 13) We from February everyone would have been ready , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) Smita Shah , managing director of Mediklin Healthcare .
For instance , specifications India mandated(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) included(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) seam - tapping , which requires importing machines - a near - impossible feat now that India is under lockdown(#included PRESENT_REF) and global supply chains are frayed(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
“ Mediklin Healthcare could have imported(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) some machines , or come(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) up with some solution , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) Relhan , chair of the Preventive Wear Manufacturer Association of India .
Now , medical staff lack(#included PRESENT_REF) sufficient masks , gloves and coveralls , according to the United Resident Doctor ’s Association India , which complained about the shortages in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday .
“ Asking(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:44:39) a health professional to work(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) without these essentials is like asking(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) a soldier to ... fight(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) without a gun , ” the United Resident Doctor ’s Association India , which complained about the shortages in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
The group ’s president , Dr Manu Gautam , said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) The group ’s president , Dr Manu Gautam , did not have(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) shortage estimates , but added(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) that at least eight health workers had been infected(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) with the coronavirus , half of at least eight health workers at government health centers .
Now lockdown is contributing(#included Now) to shortages as workers struggle(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:44:39) to get(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) to workers plants , slowing(#included Now) production(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) , manufacturers said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
The Ministry of Textiles acknowledged(#included March 18) shortages in a March 18 meeting(#included March 18) , according to minutes seen(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) by Reuters .
India needed(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) some 725,000 coveralls and 6 million N-95 masks but “ the rate of supply(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) is not able to meet(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) the rising(#overlap 2020-03-27 09:44:39) demand ” , The Ministry of Textiles said(#included Wednesday) in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday .
The Ministry of Textiles did not respond(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) to requests(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) for comment(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) .
India has centralised(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) acquisition(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) of equipment through state - owned healthcare product manufacturer HLL Lifecare .
A source at state - owned healthcare product manufacturer HLL Lifecare , said(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) state - owned healthcare product manufacturer HLL Lifecare was working(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) around the clock to provide(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) equipment but lockdown was slowing(#before 2020-03-27 09:44:39) transport .
