NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -

The dollar index = USD , which measures the greenback ’s strength against a basket of six other major currencies , is up about 3 % for the week .
“ The dollar ’s strength is , in effect , a powerful short - covering rally , ” said(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) Marc Chandler , chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex .
“ The dollar ’s strength was used(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) to fund(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) a great part of the global circuit of capital .
the global circuit of capital is in reverse now , and the funding currency is being bought(#overlap 2020-03-19 15:57:12) back , ” Marc Chandler , chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex said(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) .
The U.S. dollar rally has crushed(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) several currencies to multi - year lows .
The euro EUR= was 1.31 % lower at $ 1.077 , The euro EUR= weakest since January 2017 , as traders rushed(#after April 2017) to dump(#after April 2017) euro positions despite a fresh round of stimulus(#included June 22 , 2017) from the European Central Bank .
Though the European Central Bank announced(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) a 750 billion euro ( 704 billion pounds ) asset - purchase programme in response(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) to the coronavirus outbreak , currency traders were not impressed(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) .
“ While announced has helped(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) the bond market , announced has done little for euro , ” said(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) Marc Chandler , chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex .
The the European Central Bank ’s purchase(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) scheme(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) , announced(#included Wednesday) after an emergency(#included Wednesday) meeting(#included Wednesday) late on Wednesday , came(#included Wednesday) less than a week after policymakers launched(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) fresh stimulus measures .
The fall(#included Wednesday) in euro mirrored(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) a sudden widening(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) in FX implied(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) borrowing costs for The U.S. dollar , indicating(#included Wednesday) that investors were rushing(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) to secure(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) investors short - dated funding .
“ There are still fears(#overlap 2020-03-19 15:57:12) about refinancing(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) of European debt in U.S. dollars , ” said(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of FX and commodity research .
“ The swap facilities should normally give(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) access to euro funding .
But I think(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) this is not calming(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) down the market .
There ’s a general assumption(#overlap 2020-03-19 15:57:12) that there are a lot of U.S. funding needs , not just in Europe but also around the world as a whole . ”
Though global central banks have pumped(#included recent days) in billions of dollars in emergency liquidity injections in recent days and strengthened(#included recent days) swap lines with some global central banks , dollar funding pressures remained(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) exacerbated(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) across the board .
Investors are selling(#overlap 2020-03-19 15:57:12) what Investors can to keep(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) Investors money in dollars due to the unprecedented amount of uncertainty caused(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) by the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) , which threatens(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) to paralyse(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) the global economy .
The U.S. Federal Reserve opened(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) the taps for central banks in 9 new countries to access dollars in hopes of preventing(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) the coronavirus outbreak from causing(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) a global economic rout .
The U.S. dollar pared(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) gains(#before 2020-03-19 15:57:12) just before announced .
