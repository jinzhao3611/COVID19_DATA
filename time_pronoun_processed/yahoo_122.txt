MOSCOW / DUBAI / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil producers need(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) to resume(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) cooperation in an effort to stabilize(#after 2020-03-27 13:25:26) the global market , Russian and OPEC+ officials said(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) , as the industry reels(#overlap 2020-03-27 13:25:26) from a demand and price collapse(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) caused(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) by the coronavirus pandemic and an emerging price war .
A three - year supply pact between OPEC+ and other producers , including(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) Russia , fell(#included this month) apart this month , prompting(#included this month) OPEC+ to remove(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) limits on OPEC+ output .
The resulting(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) supply boost has coincided(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) with plummeting(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) demand as governments around the world implement(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) national lockdowns(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) to slow(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) the spread of the coronavirus pandemic .
That twin - pronged assault on prices has sent(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) Brent crude LCOc1 to a 17 - year low below $ 25 a barrel and hammered(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) the income of oil producers .
One of the reasons for the breakdown(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) of the deal between OPEC and other producers , a group known as OPEC+ , was Russia reluctance(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) to support(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) bigger curbs to output .
But there are signs that resolve could be softening(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) , with a senior Russian official telling(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) Reuters that a new OPEC+ deal might be possible if other countries join(#after 2020-03-27 13:25:26) in .
" Joint actions by countries are needed(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) to restore(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) the ( global ) economy ...
They ( joint actions ) are also possible in the deal between OPEC and other producers , a group known as OPEC+ , framework , " said(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) Kirill Dmitriev , the head of Russia 's sovereign wealth fund .
Kirill Dmitriev , the head of Russia 's sovereign wealth fund and Energy Minister Alexander Novak were Russia top negotiators for the previous OPEC+ pact , which officially expires(#included March 31) on March 31 .
Kirill Dmitriev , the head of Russia 's sovereign wealth fund declined(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) to say(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) what nations could be included(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) in a new deal .
Though the United States is the largest oil producer not included(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) in OPEC+ , the idea of Washington cooperating with other oil exporters has long been considered(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) unlikely , not least because of U.S. antitrust laws .
However , the unprecendented situation in which policymakers find(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) policymakers appears to be bringing(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) previously unthinkable ideas into play .
Forging(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) a U.S.-Saudi oil alliance is one of " many , many ideas " being floated(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) by U.S. policymakers , U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told(#included Monday) Bloomberg TV on Monday .
It is uncertain(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) if the idea of Washington cooperating with other oil exporters will become(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) a formal proposal(#after 2020-03-27 13:25:26) , U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said(#included Monday) .
U.S. President Donald Trump last week said(#included last week) that U.S. President Donald Trump would get(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) involved(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) in the oil price war(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) between Saudi Arabia and Russia at the appropriate time .
Adding(#included 2020-04-02) further pressure , the head of the International Energy Agency , an adviser to the United States and other industrialized countries , on Thursday called(#included 2020-04-02) on Saudi Arabia to help(#included 2020-04-02) stabilize(#included 2020-04-02) the global market .
OPEC+ , meanwhile , wants(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) to look(#after 2020-03-27 13:25:26) at ways to support(#after 2020-03-27 13:25:26) the global market .
Algeria , which holds the OPEC presidency at present , has called(#before 2020-03-27 13:25:26) for a meeting(#included April 10) of Algeria , which holds the OPEC presidency at present , Economic Commission Board to be held(#included March 31) no later than April 10 .
