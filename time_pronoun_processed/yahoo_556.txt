An order in the six - county San Francisco Bay Area forced(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) Tesla to close(#included March 23) its factory in Fremont south of San Francisco starting(#included March 23) March 23 to help(#included March 23) prevent(#included March 23) the company ’s spread(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) , and the company ’s was extended(#before the end of May.) until the end of May.
Public health experts say(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) An order in the six - county San Francisco Bay Area have reduced(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) the number of new coronavirus cases nationwide .
California Gov.

“ the six - county San Francisco Bay Area started(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) with a higher disease burden than the rest of California , which may mean(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) tighter restrictions(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) than the rest of California for some time , ” the Alameda County Public Health Department said(#included Saturday) in a statement .
“ Restoring(#included PRESENT_REF) all daily activities too soon risks(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) a rapid spike in cases and would jeopardize(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) the relative stability we ’ve seen(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) in our health and hospital systems . ”
Despite threatened , it would be costly and difficult for Musk to quickly shift(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) production from Fremont south of San Francisco to another building in Texas or Texas / Nevada .
The Fremont facility , which was formerly run jointly by General Motors and Toyota , currently is Tesla ’s only U.S. vehicle assembly(#included PRESENT_REF) plant , and Tesla ’s would lose(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) critical production if Tesla ’s shut(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) its factory in Fremont south of San Francisco down to move(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) equipment .

For the moment , the continued(#overlap 2020-05-09 20:43:46) closure of Fremont south of San Francisco is costing(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) Fremont south of San Francisco revenue .
On a conference(#included last month) call(#included last month) last month , Musk said(#included last month) Fremont south of San Francisco only has(#overlap 2020-05-09 20:43:46) two auto plants , and The Fremont facility , which was formerly run jointly by General Motors and Toyota , produces(#overlap 2020-05-09 20:43:46) the majority of Fremont south of San Francisco vehicles .
“ Fremont south of San Francisco are a bit worried(#overlap 2020-05-09 20:43:46) about not being able to resume(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) production(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) in the six - county San Francisco Bay Area , and resume should be identified(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) as a serious risk , ” Musk said(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) .

Tesla is the only major automaker with a factory in California .
threatened came(#included earlier this month) after a series of bizarre tweets(#included earlier this month) earlier this month including(#included earlier this month) one that said(#before 2020-05-09 20:43:46) Tesla ’s stock price was too high .
