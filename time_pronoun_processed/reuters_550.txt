LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil prices ticked(#included Thursday) up on Thursday after sharp losses in the previous session , with investors hoping(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) that a big build - up in U.S. inventories may mean(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) producers have(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) little option but to deepen(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) output cuts(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) as the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) ravages(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) demand .

With official data showing(#included Wednesday) U.S. inventories surging(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) the most on record , U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) fell(#included Wednesday) on Wednesday to U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) lowest since February 2002 , with Brent losing(#included Wednesday) more than 6 % .
Brent was down 19 cents , or 0.7 % , at $ 27.50 a barrel by 0754 GMT .
U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) was up 7 cents , or 0.4 % , at $ 19.94 .
U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) eked(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) out U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) first tentative gains(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) after falling(#included November 24 , 2019) for four sessions(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) .
Both contracts are poised(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) for weekly losses(#included current) of around 10 % .
Swiss bank Julius Baer ’s Head of Economics Norbert Ruecker said(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) “ oil prices must remain(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) depressed(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) to force(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) shut - ins among non - cartelised producers , ” such as the United States , where much production is not economic at current prices .
“ We stick(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) to We Neutral view and see(#included Wednesday) prices continuing(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) to swing(#included current) wildly around current levels in the very near term , ” Swiss bank Julius Baer ’s Head of Economics Norbert Ruecker added(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) .
Concerns about crumbling(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) demand kept(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) a lid on gains(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) , with Both contracts trading(#included Wednesday) earlier in the previous session as much as 2.5 % higher than on Wednesday .
Energy Information Administration data also showed(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) large U.S. refined(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) fuels stock builds(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) despite refiners operating(#after September 2008) at 69 % of capacity nationwide , the lowest since September 2008 .
“ The massive storage build , as counterintuitive as The massive storage build sounds(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) , did provide(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) some price support as The massive storage build foreshadows(#included Wednesday) that more wellhead closures are just around the corner , which effectively trims(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) U.S. supply , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) Stephen Innes , chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp .
Energy Information Administration data followed(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) a report(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) that forecast oil demand would fall(#included April) by 29 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in April to the lowest in 25 years , and to just below 30 % of pre - coronavirus global demand levels .
sharp losses in the previous session is far more than the 9.7 million bpd output cuts(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) agreed(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) producers including(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) Russia .
Hoped(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) - for cuts(#after September 2008) of another 10 million bpd from other countries , including(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) the United States , could lower(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) production(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) by 20 million bpd , although some analysts have questioned(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) lower .
Some countries have also committed(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) to increasing(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) purchases(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) of oil for Some countries strategic stockpiles , but there are limits to how much oil can be bought(#included these days) and the extent of global coordination .
Speaking of U.S. strategic reserve buying , Commerzbank analysts said(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) that “ U.S. strategic reserve buying would accommodate(#after 2020-04-16 10:07:07) 23 million barrels , which would normally constitute(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) a massive additional reserve but these days would only just be enough to cope(#after 2020-04-16 10:07:07) with one weekly increase(#included April) in stocks . ”
Highlighting(#included current) current oversupply(#included current) concerns(#included current) , Brent ’s six - month contango , a market structure where prompt prices are lower than those for later dates , kept(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) hovering(#overlap 2020-04-16 10:07:07) around $ 9.4 a barrel , near levels seen(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) before talk of a global output cut(#before 2020-04-16 10:07:07) .
