A senior Iranian health official said(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) the greater Tehran area may face(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) a coronavirus resurgence(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) after many residents flouted(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) advisories to stay(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) home , crowding(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) streets and causing(#included 2020-04-04) traffic jams across Tehran as the country 's New Year holidays ended(#included 2020-04-04) on Saturday .
Iran - the Middle East country worst - hit by the epidemic -said(#included 2020-04-05) earlier on Saturday that 158 more coronavirus patients had died(#included 2020-04-05) in the past 24 hours , bringing(#included 2020-04-05) the total death toll to 3,452 .
The total number of cases reached(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) 55,743 .
" We are still concerned(#included 2020-04-05) about the epidemic , for example with the level of traffic in Tehran today and queues of cars stuck(#included 2020-04-05) on freeways , because these people can take(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) the epidemic to these people homes or workplaces , " Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said(#included 2020-04-05) on state TV .
" Even a medium level of virus here can spread(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) to nearby cities with the high level of job - related traffic between nearby cities and Tehran , " said(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) Harirchi , who has himself been ill with COVID-19 .
" Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi cautioned(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) about a probable return(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) of coronavirus in case of negligence and said(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) social distancing measures(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) were absolutely necessary , " said(#included 2020-04-05) state TV .
state TV showed(#included 2020-04-04) stores that had re(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) despite a closure order on non - essential services and businesses .
Only enterprises involved(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) in production have been allowed(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) to re(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) while following(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) anti - coronavirus precautions(#included 2020-04-05) .
Officials have repeatedly complained(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) that many Iranians ignored(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) appeals(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) to stay(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) at home and cancel(#included New Year) travel(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) plans for the country 's New Year holidays .
Iranians traditionally travel(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) to home provinces and popular vacation spots and organise(#included New Year) family gatherings during the country 's New Year holidays .
Officials initially urged(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) people to cancel(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) such plans due to the coronavirus outbreak , and then imposed(#included 2021-03-25) inter - city travel bans(#included 2021-03-25) on March 25 .
Earlier the judiciary said(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) most of some 70 inmates who escaped(#included 2020-03) from a prison in western Iran last month are now back in jail .
About 100,000 prisoners have been granted(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) temporary release due to the coronavirus outbreak .
Iranian media have reported(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) unrest in several prisons .
CRITICISM OF U.S. SANCTIONS
In a rare comment(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) in Britain 's Guardian newspaper , Tehran Mayor Pirouz Hanachi said(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) U.S. sanctions were crippling(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) Iran fight(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) against coronavirus .
" As a result ( of sanctions(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) ) , the ability of my colleagues and I to provide(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) the health , logistical and other essential infrastructure necessary to combat(#after 2020-04-04 18:33:38) the coronavirus outbreak has been drastically reduced(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) .
my colleagues and I experience(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) this loss every day , and this loss can be counted(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) in people that would not have died(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) , " Tehran Mayor Pirouz Hanachi said(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) .
Separately , the foreign ministry accused(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of " medical - terrorism " through U.S. sanctions .
" Undisputed fact : US ' diplomats ' have long been in the business of coups(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) , arming(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) terrorists , " ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said(#included 2020-04-04) on Twitter on Saturday . "
But @SecPompeo ... and ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi masters have taken(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) the ' job ' to a whole new level : # Medical_terrorism . "
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other U.S. officials have stressed(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) that humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions(#included 2015) Washington reimposed(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) on Tehran after President Donald Trump abandoned(#included 2015) Iran â€™s 2015 multilateral deal to limit(#included 2015) Iran nuclear programme .
However , broader U.S. sanctions(#overlap 2020-04-04 18:33:38) deter(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) many U.S. and global firms from humanitarian trade(#after 2020-04-04 18:33:38) with Iran .
Meanwhile state media quoted(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) President Hassan Rouhani as saying(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) that state support for businesses hit(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) by the coronavirus outbreak would be restricted(#after 2020-04-04 18:33:38) to enterprises that give(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) assurances not to lay(#before 2020-04-04 18:33:38) off workers .
