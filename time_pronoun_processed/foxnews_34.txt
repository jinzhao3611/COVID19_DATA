Amid a recent warming of relations , the Taliban and the Afghan government held(#included 2020-04-05) a “ virtual ” meeting to discuss prisoner releases on Sunday , according to officials .
the Taliban and the Afghan government spoke(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) for two hours in a Skype meeting(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) facilitated(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) by the U.S. and Qatar .

In exchange , Taliban, Afghan government would release(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) 1,000 Afghani prisoners .
But , one day after a Taliban peace agreement signed by the U.S. last month was signed(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) , Afghan president Ashraf Ghani rejected(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) the notion of releasing(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) Afghan prisoners as a precondition(#before 2020-03-23 01:10:58) for peace negotiations(#after 2020-03-23 01:10:58) .
