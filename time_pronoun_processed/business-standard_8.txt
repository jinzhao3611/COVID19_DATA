Coronavirus may bug(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) diesel may after gasoline, jet fuel price crash(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
2020-04-04 14:10:04 +00:00 .
The world over , one mainstream fuel -- -- has managed(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to remain(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) a decent profit center for the oil refining industry at large as the novel ravages(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) economies and economies wider demand for petroleum products .
has risen(#included PAST_REF) in value relative to crude in recent weeks due to a combination of continued(#included PAST_REF) industrial usage and purchasing(#included PAST_REF) of a near - identical fuel for stockpiling(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) as a heating oil in Europe .
In addition , there have been curbs in refining(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to minimize(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) a glut of products like gasoline and jet fuel .
But diesel ’s star is starting(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to fade(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) , with diesel ’s star premium to crude oil recently dropping(#included PAST_REF) in trading hubs around the world .
As refiners try(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to maximize(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) output of the fuel and with only a finite amount of land - based storage , it may be just a matter of time before the market starts(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to collapse(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
“ It feels(#included PAST_REF) like we ’re running(#included PAST_REF) almost at full tilt into a brick wall , ” said(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) Steve Sawyer , director of refining at Facts Global Energy .
Diesel ’s premium to crude in northwest Europe dropped(#included 2020-04-03) to under $ 10 a barrel on Friday , after settling(#included 2020-04-03) at a little over $ 17 -- the highest since October -- on March 30 .
The premium , or so - called crack spread , has also dropped(#included PAST_REF) dramatically in Singapore and on the U.S. Gulf Coast in recent days .
Until now , has been somewhat shielded(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) from the troubles plaguing(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) jet fuel and gasoline , which have tumbled(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) in value as airlines ground flights(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) and governments impose(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) restrictions(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) on people ’s movement .
Because of the collapse(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) of those markets , refiners have been focusing(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) on diesel production(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) instead , building(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) up a potential problem for the future .
The extent of the possible oversupply is unclear(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
Diesel margins in Europe are likely to be hit(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) first , Steve Sawyer , director of refining at Facts Global Energy said(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) , adding(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) that Europe ’s relatively high number of diesel - powered passenger vehicles makes(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) the fuel there potentially vulnerable to coronavirus - related lockdowns(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) that sap(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) demand .
Tankers hauling(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) millions of barrels of unwanted product from Asia and Russia will further add(#after 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to supplies .
America is also seeing(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) waning(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) demand .
Pilot Company , the country ’s biggest truck stop company , said(#included 2020-03-30) diesel sales(#included PAST_REF) across Pilot Company , the country ’s biggest truck stop company , business were strong several weeks ago , when the World Health Organization declared(#included PAST_REF) the a pandemic(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
Since then , diesel sales(#included 2020-W14) have dipped(#included 2020-W14) , this week down about 10 - 15 % as industrial plants , other businesses and cities shut(#included 2020-W14) , according to Pilot Company , the country ’s biggest truck stop company , Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Haslam .
Refineries across the world have been curbing(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) production(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) as the outbreak(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) spreads(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
If supply drops(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) enough , then the risk of a diesel glut will subside(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
One factor to watch(#included seasonal) will be the amount of fuel that moves(#after 2020-04-04 14:10:04) into storage .
In Europe ’s Amsterdam - Rotterdam - Antwerp region , diesel and gasoil supplies in independent storage are near diesel and gasoil supplies in independent storage lowest seasonal levels in six years , data from Facts Global Energy show(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
Distillate inventories in America have also declined(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) , according to government data .
“ We do n’t actually expect(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) to see(#included the coming weeks) that much diesel end up in stock in the coming(#included the coming weeks) weeks , ” said(#before 2020-04-04 14:10:04) Eugene Lindell , senior consultant at JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna .
“ see is because that much diesel is the only product that is short , and therefore the only product that keeps(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) refineries running(#overlap 2020-04-04 14:10:04) .
So if demand falls(#after 2020-04-04 14:10:04) more , supply will have to fall(#after 2020-04-04 14:10:04) more as well . ”
