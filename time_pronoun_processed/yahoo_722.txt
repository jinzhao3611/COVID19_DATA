There’s No Real Oversight Of The $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Law .
2020-04-19 15:04:54 +00:00 .
When Congress passed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) the largest spending law in American history , a $ 2 trillion outlay(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) aimed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) at offsetting(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) the economic damage(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) wrought(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) by the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) , Congress set(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) up three different ways to look(#after 2020-04-19 15:04:54) after the enormous sums and root out corruption or mismanagement(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) of the cash .
Three weeks later , none of the three options ― a special inspector general appointed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) by President Donald Trump , a council of existing inspectors general , or a special oversight panel set(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) up by Congress ― are active .
Sabotage by the President Donald Trump administration , combined(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) with congressional apathy and gridlock , means the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are spending(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) hundreds of millions of dollars with no real watchdogs .
The special inspector general appointed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) by President Donald Trump has(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) views of executive power that have alarmed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) Democrats , and stands(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:04:54) little chance of confirmation(#before May.) until May.
President Donald Trump shoved(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) aside the leader of a council of existing inspectors general .
And the congressional oversight panel ’s roster remains(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:04:54) unfilled .
Meanwhile , the government program to loan(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) money to small businesses to keep(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) workers on the job has already burned(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) through more than $ 300 billion , and the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have unveiled(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) a slew of programs(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) to push(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) trillions more into the economy .
The shambolic state of efforts to oversee(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) the relief efforts has left(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) government accountability advocates dismayed(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:04:54) and progressives frustrated(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) with the oversight(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) of a massive spending deal that Democrats and Republican teamed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) up to pass(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) with almost no objections .
“ We ca n’t really afford(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:04:54) to be behind the ball on oversight(#included right now) right now , because We will miss(#after 2020-04-19 15:04:54) a crucial opportunity to stop(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) waste , fraud and abuse before waste , fraud and abuse happens(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) , ” said(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) Liz Hempowicz , director of public policy at We .
Here ’s a breakdown(#included right now) of how each part of the oversight(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:04:54) triad is failing(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:04:54) :
The Congressional Oversight Commission
The oversight commission , which is supposed(#before 2020-04-19 15:04:54) to oversee(#after 2020-04-19 15:04:54) the $ 500 billion that ...
