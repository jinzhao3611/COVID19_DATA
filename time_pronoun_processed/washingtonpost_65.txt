This creates(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) a problem for investors : With China ’s real economy practically shut(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) down , China ’s do n’t know(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) how to trade(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) or position(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) China ’s .
know could make(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) things more volatile .
Consider how this is playing(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) out in the hardware supply chain .
Until recently , the hardware supply chain was a shining(#before recently) star , as investors bet(#before recently) that consumers would rush(#included later this year) to buy(#included later this year) 5 G phones later this year .
The coronavirus outbreak has completely changed(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) the calculus .
In the smartphone - manufacturing provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong , China has forced(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) employees to stay(#before recently) home until Feb. 10 .
More delays(#after 2020-01-31 03:03:06) could be coming(#after 2020-01-31 03:03:06) ; the smartphone - manufacturing provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong are the hardest - hit after Hubei , the epicenter of the virus .
How can smartphone makers and smartphone makers suppliers fill(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) demand – if there is any – when factories are closed(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) ?
And then there ’s the trouble of earnings reports .
While the U.S. market is getting(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) propped(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) up by solid corporate profits from the likes of Amazon.com Inc. , we may not see(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) anything out of China for weeks , if not months .
Because of strict travel restrictions(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) , auditors may not be able to visit(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) company sites and do auditors work .
The Hong Kong bourse , which hosts(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) more than 1,000 mainland companies , may have to extend(#after 2020-01-31 03:03:06) the March 31 deadline for 2019 reports .
extend leaves(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) investors only with broad - brush data on The coronavirus outbreak .
Depending(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) on investors mood , 2019 reports can be read(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) as glass half - full or half - empty .
For example , the number of new patients in Hubei , the epicenter of the virus has been roughly steady for three consecutive days .
Optimists could see(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) read as evidence of China ’s bureaucratic machine effectively controlling(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) The coronavirus outbreak , while pessimists might say(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) read is proof of underreporting .
Diagnosis tool kits are in short supply(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) , so conceivably , thousands of infected people are just waiting(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) to be tested(#after 2020-01-31 03:03:06) positive .
You might ask(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) why China is willing to open(#included March 31) China financial markets so soon , with businesses closed(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) and factories quiet .
To China credit , China has learned(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) a thing or two after the stock rout of 2015 , when China put(#included 2015) indefinite trading(#included 2015) halts on as many as half of mainland - listed firms .
In a stroke(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) , public markets were practically transformed(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) into a private one .
Not only did that sour investor appetite , China also delayed(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) MSCI Inc. ’s decision(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) to include(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) A - shares in MSCI Inc. ’s well - tracked indexes .
So MSCI Inc. ’s unlikely to see(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) a repeat(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) performance , even if bureaucrats do conduct(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) window guidance now and then to stem(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) a selloff .
Compared(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) with the SARS epidemic(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) , whose spread was dangerously underreported(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) , China has vastly improved(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) China communication strategy .
China now releases(#included now) updates(#included now) of confirmed(#included now) cases twice daily .
China is left(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) with few good options , with a viable vaccine possibly months or even years away .
Still , China can do more to improve(#after 2020-01-31 03:03:06) transparency .
China could , for instance , open(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) up China medical - supply database so the public can assess(#after 2020-01-31 03:03:06) the severity of test - kit shortages for China .
China also needs(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) to prove(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) China bureaucratic apparatus works – and a lot more urgently than in 2003 , when the economy was operating(#included 2003) at full steam .
Until then , MSCI Inc. ’s left(#overlap 2020-01-31 03:03:06) with wild guessing games(#before 2020-01-31 03:03:06) .
