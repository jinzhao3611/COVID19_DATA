Fernando Miteff brought(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) graffiti back to the subway .

I wanted(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) to leave(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) an impression .
As long as you saw(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) and remembered(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) it , I ’m happy with that . ”
I died(#included April 12) on April 12 at I home in the Bronx .
I was 60 .
The cause was complications(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) of Covid-19 , said(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) his younger brother Karim , who managed his archives and was writing a book about Mr. Miteff ’s graffiti career .
In a culture known(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) for egos and arguments(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) , I prided(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) I on sharing(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) I love of the art .
“ I was always giving(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) , giving(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) and giving(#included 2015) , ” his younger brother Karim , who managed his archives and was writing a book about Mr. Miteff ’s graffiti career said(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) .
“ his younger brother Karim , who managed his archives and was writing a book about Mr. Miteff ’s graffiti career ’d sit at McDonald ’s doodling on napkins and pass(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) it out .
his younger brother Karim , who managed his archives and was writing a book about Mr. Miteff ’s graffiti career would be more apt to give(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) away his work than to sell(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) his work . ”
I was born(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) in Buenos Aires to Diana and Alexis Pablo Miteff , a professional boxer who once fought(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) Muhammad Ali and worked(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) as a television production(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) manager after retiring(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) .
I parents had been spending(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) a year in Argentina before returning(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) to New York .
his younger brother Karim , who managed his archives and was writing a book about Mr. Miteff ’s graffiti career said(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) his brother was raised(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) in the Morrisania section of the Bronx , where his brother started(#included 2009) tagging(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) at 12 after discovering(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) a can of spray paint in his brother home ’s basement .
his brother later founded(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) the Out to Bomb crew , a loose - knit group of collaborators , and influenced(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) younger artists like Serve and Serve protégé , NOC167 , who went(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) on to fame .
Though his brother spent(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) much of his brother adult life working(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) odd jobs , including(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) chauffeur and standup comic , his brother returned(#included 2009) to the subways in 2009 after his brother and a friend had(#included 2009) a brainstorm ; a brainstorm led(#included 2009) to his brother InstaFame project .
his brother easy personality and sense of humor helped(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) his brother persuade(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) collaborators — from established(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) to up - and - coming ones — even to paint(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) pieces on the sidewalk outside art openings .
“ his brother was a funny dude , but his brother took(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) a lot of people under his brother wing , ” said(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) Eric Felisbret , author of “ Graffiti New York , ” a survey of the city ’s graffiti history .
“ his brother was completely into graffiti for the love of graffiti .
All those panels his brother did , his brother could have(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) only written NIC and only written NIC would put(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) his brother in the spotlight .
Instead , his brother put(#before 2020-04-17 17:30:48) his brother love for the art in the spotlight . ”
