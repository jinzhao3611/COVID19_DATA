The possible payment of such a large dividend at a time the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) has left(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) cash - starved manufacturers pushing(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) for government financial support has sparked(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) criticism(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) within the ruling coalition .
“ In the talks(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) with ROME / MILAN ( Reuters ) - Italy , such a large dividend is not an item being discussed(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) at the moment .
But , if you ask(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) REUTERS / Flavio Lo Scalzo whether the government will set(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) no conditions in the near future , REUTERS / Flavio Lo Scalzo ’d reply(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) that the government ’s too early to say(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) , ” a senior government source told(#included Tuesday) Reuters on Tuesday .
However , such a large dividend is a central element affecting(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) the overall value of its merger with Peugeot and some analysts say(#included Tuesday) its merger with Peugeot could still unravel(#after 2020-05-19 16:51:58) if different conditions were imposed(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) .
Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) said(#included last week) last week Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) Italian division was working(#included last week) with the government and lender Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ) to obtain(#included last week) 80 % state guarantees on a 6.3 billion euro three - year loan facility to help weather the pandemic .
80 % state guarantees on a 6.3 billion euro three - year loan facility to help weather the pandemic would be part of more than 400 billion euros Italy is making(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) available to businesses .
To qualify(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) , companies must agree(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) not to pay(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) dividends this year .
Taking(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) 80 % state guarantees on a 6.3 billion euro three - year loan facility to help weather the pandemic would not legally bar(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) from distributing(#after 2020-05-19 16:51:58) such a large dividend as the payment(#before 2021) is not expected(#before 2021) until 2021 and would be made(#before 2021) by Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in the Netherlands .
But the issue has aroused(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) opposition among some members of the ruling(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) coalition of the centre - left Democratic Party and the anti - establishment 5 Star Movement .
“ Most of us oppose(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) the payment of the maxi - dividend by Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) , ” one prominent 5 Star source told(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) Reuters , adding(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) that some party members were also campaigning(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) to extend(#before 2021) the ban(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) on dividend payments(#before 2021) in the loan scheme until the end of 2021 .
Former industry minister Carlo Calenda , who is now in opposition , also said(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) on Twitter that Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) would not need(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) a 6.3 billion euro state - backed loan if such a large dividend were not paid(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) .
Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri , who has said(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) he backs(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) its merger with Peugeot , said(#included Monday) on Monday that Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) had to promise(#included Monday) more investments(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) in Italy and to avoid(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) moving(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) factories outside Italy if Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) wanted(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) to apply(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) for a state - backed loan .
“ the government aims(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) to preserve(#overlap 2020-05-19 16:51:58) and strengthen(#after 2020-05-19 16:51:58) Fiat ’s roots in Italy , as Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) is about to carry(#included 2019) out its merger with Peugeot , he said(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) .
Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) and Peugeot owner PSA ( PEUP.PA ) last week scrapped(#included last week) ordinary dividend payouts on 2019 results , worth 1.1 billion euros for each company .
As part of its merger with Peugeot , Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) is also due(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) to pay(#before 2020-05-19 16:51:58) Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) shareholders the special dividend worth 5.5 billion euros just before Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) closes(#included 2019) its merger with Peugeot .
