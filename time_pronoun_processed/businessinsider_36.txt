The spread of coronavirus in King County , Washington was the first major outbreak(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) of the virus seen(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) in the US .
The first case of COVID-19 at a King County nursing home was identified(#included 2020-02-28) February 28 .
Contact tracers believe(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:51:05) The first case of COVID-19 at a King County nursing home started(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) with a healthcare professional working(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) at the home , who had(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) symptoms of the coronavirus in a Washington nursing home .
Within a week , seven residents had(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) testing(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) positive after showing(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) symptoms .
Others later developed(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) symptoms , and also tested(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) positive .
As the epidemic(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) escalated(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) , a King County nursing home started(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) conducting(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) blanket tests(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) , including(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) on residents who did not show(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) any symptoms , eventually testing(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) 76 of the 82 people in a nursing facility in King County , Washington .
Three refused(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) to be tested(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) , two were already in hospital being treated(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) for the disease by the time testing(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) began(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) , and one was not available for testing(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) .
According to A new CDC report , a third ( 23 ) of two tested(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) positive , but 13 of two had(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) no symptoms at all .
Of those who did exhibit(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) symptoms , eight had(#included 2020-02-28) typical symptoms , but two had(#included 2020-02-28) more unusual symptoms : melancholy and nausea .
A week later , 10 of the 13 with asymptomatic cases had developed(#included A week later) symptoms .
A new CDC report does have(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) limitations .
A new CDC report only addresses(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:51:05) a single long - term care facility , and the authors acknowledge(#included 2020-02-28) it can be difficulty(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:51:05) to accurately assess(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) symptoms among patients with dementia and other forms of cognitive decline(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) .
But the coronavirus in a Washington nursing home is already known(#before 2020-03-27 18:51:05) to spread(#overlap 2020-03-27 18:51:05) rapidly , particularly under close confines such as a care facility or nursing home .
Currently , attempts to slow(#after 2020-03-27 18:51:05) the spread of the disease primarily rely(#included PRESENT_REF) on common symptoms like fever , coughing(#included PRESENT_REF) , and shortness of breath to identify(#included PRESENT_REF) and isolate(#included PRESENT_REF) new cases .
