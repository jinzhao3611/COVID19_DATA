Preamble
Hello and welcome(#Depend-on 2020-02-29 16:47:41) to live coverage(#included 11.34am) of Watford v Liverpool from Vicarage Road .
Even allowing(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) for the received(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) wisdom that football is a funny old game , it would be seriously bizarre(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) if Watford v Liverpool were denied(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) Watford v Liverpool first title for 30 years because of a pandemic(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) .
If the coronavirus does not end(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) the season early , Watford v Liverpool need(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) 12 points from their last 11 games to clinch(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) Watford v Liverpool first Premier League title .
Watford v Liverpool could still do it at Watford v Liverpool on 16 March , the third of their last 11 games , should Manchester City drop(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) points in the meantime .
For the time being , Watford v Liverpool focus is on beating(#included 16 March) Watford v Liverpool and extending(#included 16 March) Watford v Liverpool lead to 25 points .
Yawn , meh , 25 points .
Hang(#included 16 March) on , 25 points ? !
I ’m not sure(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) Watford v Liverpool are getting(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) enough credit .
You might not like(#included 2020-03-29) Watford v Liverpool , you might think(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) Premier League is a bit naff , you might be sick(#overlap 2020-02-29 16:47:41) of the sight of Jurgen Klopp ’s teeth , but come on : they ’ve won(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) 35 of they ’ve last 36 league games FFS !
won has never happened(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) before in Europe ’s biggest leagues .
In fact , they ’ve record this season - P27 W26 D1 L0 - belongs(#included 2020-03-29) in Sunday League football .
There is one difference .
A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football would have(#included this) a goal difference of around +200 .
Liverpool ’s is a mere +47 , and 13 of A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football 26 victories(#included this) this season have been by a single goal – many of A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football requiring(#included 2020-03-29) late winners .
That might be the reason(#included 2020-03-29) for the slightly muted response(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) to win(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) after win(#included 2020-03-29) after win(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) ; it feels(#included this) like Manchester City received(#included two years ago) more effusive praise two years ago when Manchester City regularly thumped(#included two years ago) teams by four or five .
I also think(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) there ’s an element of everyone - even Liverpool fans - struggling(#overlap 2020-02-29 16:47:41) to get(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) everyone - even Liverpool fans - head around such unprecedented threepointery .
Or maybe the world is full of Expected Goals disciples .
Watford v Liverpool are second in the xG table , although an Expected Win(#included tonight) tonight will move(#included tonight) Watford v Liverpool within two Expected Points of Manchester City .
I ’d argue(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) that Watford v Liverpool having to work(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) so hard for many wius actually enhances(#before 2020-02-29 16:47:41) rather than diminishes(#overlap 2020-02-29 16:47:41) Watford v Liverpool achievement .
The soundbites may be cheesy but Liverpool ’s also true :
Watford v Liverpool are mentality monsters , the toughest in English football for a long while .
Watford v Liverpool played(#included 2020-03-29) well in a 2 - 0 defeat(#included December) at Anfield in December , so you never know(#included this) what might happen(#included this) tonight .
But 106 points from the last 108 available should give(#included tonight) you a pretty good idea .
Kick off is at 5.30pm .
Updated(#included tonight) at 11.37am EST
