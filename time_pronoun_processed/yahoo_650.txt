‘I can’t tell(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) you’: Trump adds(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) to Kim Jong-un confusion(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) amid speculation over North Korea leader’s health .
2020-04-29 01:38:30 +00:00 .
Trump added(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) to the confusion(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong - un by claiming(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) Kim Jong-un has(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) a “ very good idea ” about the dictator ’s condition .
Kim Jong-un ’s whereabouts and health status have been a subject(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) of intense speculation(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) after Seoul - based website Daily NK reported(#included last week) last week Kim Jong-un was recovering(#included last week) after undergoing(#included 12 April) a cardiovascular procedure on 12 April .
“ Trump ca n’t tell(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) you exactly , ” Trump said(#included Monday) when asked(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) about the dictator ’s condition at a White House news conference(#included Monday) on Monday .
“ Yes , Trump do have(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) a very good idea , but Trump ca n’t talk(#included PRESENT_REF) about a very good idea now .
Trump just wish(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) Kim Jong-un well . ”
Suggesting(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) the mystery would soon be cleared(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) up , Trump added(#included Monday) : “ Trump hope(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) Kim Jong-un ’s fine .
Trump do know(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) how Kim Jong-un ’s doing relatively speaking(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) .
We will see(#after 2020-04-29 01:38:30) – you ’ll probably be hearing(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) in the not too distant future . ”
Yet Trump appeared(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) to contradict(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) Trump only moments later when Trump said(#included Monday) “ nobody knows(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) where Kim Jong-un is ” .
It comes(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) as the North Korea authorities publishing(#included 27 April) a letter purportedly from Kim Jong-un to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa – dated(#included 27 April) 27 April – as “ proof ” that Kim Jong-un is alive and well .
State media have previously reported(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) that Trump sent(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) greetings(#included Monday) to Syrian president Bashar Assad and Cuban president Miguel Diaz - Canel .
Not seen(#included 27 April , 2020) in public since 12 April , the leader ’s absence from public ceremonies(#included 12 April) on the birth anniversary of Kim Jong-un on 12 April was unprecedented – leading(#included 27 April , 2020) to days of speculation over the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong - un .
South Korean officials have cautioned(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) against reports(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) that Kim Jong-un may be ill and emphasised(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) South Korean officials have detected(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) no unusual movements in North Korea .

More North Korea ’s minister for North Korean affairs(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) said(#included Tuesday) on Tuesday that Kim Jong-un may have missed(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) the key holiday because of concerns over the coronavirus , not because Kim Jong-un is ill .
“ It is true that Kim Jong-un had never missed(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) the anniversary for Kim Jong-un ’s birthday since Kim Jong-un took(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) power , but many anniversary events including(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) celebrations(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) and a banquet had been cancelled(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) because of coronavirus concerns , ” Kim Jong-un said(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) at a parliamentary hearing .
Kim Jong-un said(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) there were at least two instances since mid - January where Kim Jong-un was out of sight for nearly 20 days .
“ Trump do n’t think(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) that ’s particularly unusual given the current [ coronavirus ] situation . ”
A special train possibly belonging(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) to Kim Jong-un was spotted(#included last week) last week at the North Korean resort town of Wonsan , according to satellite images reviewed(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) by 38 North , a North Korea monitoring(#overlap 2020-04-29 01:38:30) project .
Despite ’s claim(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) to have(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) a “ very good idea ” about the dictator ’s condition , experts said(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) nobody outside North Korea knew(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) exactly what was happening(#included last week) .
Cheon Seong Whun , a presidential secretary during the South Korea ’s previous conservative government , said(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) Seoul had struggled(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) for several decades to get(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) a strong grip on the location and health of North Korea ’s top leadership .
“ Anybody who says they know something for certain is just writing(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) a novel , ” Cheon Seong Whun , a presidential secretary during the South Korea ’s previous conservative government , said(#before 2020-04-29 01:38:30) .
