“ The financial exposure faced(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) by Dark Mofo ’s cancellation would run(#after 2020-03-10 23:47:15) into the millions , and likely end(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) Hobart ’s mid - winter festival Dark Mofo , hosted by the Museum of Old and New Art and set for June permanently , ” Dark Mofo ’s creative director , Leigh Carmichael , said(#included 2020-04-03) on Wednesday .

In a typically idiosyncratic statement(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) , [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh said(#included 2020-04-03) on Facebook the decision(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) “ will murder(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) an already massacred(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) tourism in Hobart ” but “ [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh feel(#included 2020-04-03) like [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh have(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) no choice ( hint : that means [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh have(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) a choice ” .
The early decision(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) largely came(#included mid - winter) down to “ fear compelled(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) by uncertainty ” , [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh said(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) .
His wife , the artist Kirsha Kaechele , was having(#included 2020-04-03) trouble selling(#included 2020-04-03) tickets to an April fundraiser ; [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh ’s gambling - related income had already been jeopardised(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) ( “ horseracing is being cancelled(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) in COVID-19 - affected countries .
Soon , that might be all of them ” ) ; and His wife , the artist Kirsha Kaechele , was concerned(#overlap 2020-03-10 23:47:15) “ we would have(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) trouble selling(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) tickets to Hobart ’s mid - winter festival Dark Mofo , hosted by the Museum of Old and New Art and set for June events also ” .
“ Right now , the government and Mona are each on the hook for $ 2 million to run(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) Hobart ’s mid - winter festival Dark Mofo , hosted by the Museum of Old and New Art and set for June , ” [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh continued(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) .
“ That ’s bad .
What ’s worse , as far as [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh ’m concerned(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) , is that if the government and Mona ran(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) Hobart ’s mid - winter festival Dark Mofo , hosted by the Museum of Old and New Art and set for June and nobody came(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) , [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh ’d lose(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) $ 5 million or more …
That kind of blowout would affect(#after 2020-03-10 23:47:15) Mona ’s program , and [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh ’d be back to subsisting(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) on the diet [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh had(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) when [ Mona ’s owner ] David Walsh was eighteen – pineapples and mint slice biscuits . ”
Bon Iver ’s sold - out performances – the only part of Mona ’s program that had been announced(#before 2020-03-10 23:47:15) – are still going(#included 12) ahead on 12 and 13 June , “ subject to further government advice ” .
The rest of Mona ’s program will be pushed(#included 12) to next year .
