As the epidemic(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) escalated(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) , a King County nursing home started(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) conducting(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) blanket tests(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) , including(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) on residents who did not show(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) any symptoms , eventually testing(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) 76 of the 82 people in a nursing facility in King County , Washington .
Three refused(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) to be tested(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) , two were already in hospital being treated(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) for the disease by the time testing(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) began(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) , and one was not available for testing(#before 2020-03-27 20:16:29) .
