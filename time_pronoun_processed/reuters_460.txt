a state of emergency is set(#included May 6) to expire(#included May 6) on May 6 .
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) the situation remained(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) tough and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would make(#included May 6) a decision on a state of emergency or Monday .
On Thursday , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned(#included Thursday) citizens to prepare(#included Friday) for a “ drawn - out battle(#included April 28 , 2020) ” against the virus and political sources told(#included Friday) Reuters the government was planning(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) to extend(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) a state of emergency for about a month .
“ For a while , the government are going(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) to need(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) to keep(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) its coronavirus containment policies going(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) , ” Shigeru Omi , a member of a government panel of experts , told(#included Friday) a news conference(#included Friday) after a meeting(#included Friday) on Friday .
“ New cases have n’t declined(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) quite as much as we ’d like , and there are some regions where the medical system has n’t been able to prepare(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) sufficiently . ”
Earlier , Economics Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) reporters the experts had also said(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) some regions needed(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) to keep(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) strict restrictions in place while others could start(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) to ease(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) some regions .
Japan has had(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) more than 14,000 confirmed(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) cases and 436 deaths(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) , according to an NHK tally .
Of the confirmed(#included Friday) cases , more than 4,000 were in Tokyo , Japan , with 165 new ones on Friday .
But there are worries(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) that Japan ’s low testing regime has undercounted(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) many coronavirus cases , and fears(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) that the medical system may be strained(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) caring(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) for many coronavirus cases .
The outbreak(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) and slowdown(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) in business activities is darkening(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) the outlook for the world ’s third - biggest economy , leading(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) to calls(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) for more spending even after parliament approved(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) an extra budget to fund(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) a $ 1.1 trillion stimulus package .
Consumer prices in Tokyo , Japan fell(#included 2020-04) for the first time in three years in April and national factory activity slumped(#included Thursday) , data showed(#included Friday) on Friday , increasing(#included Friday) worries(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) outbreak could tip(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) Japan back into deflation(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) .
WARNING
the government has called(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) for vigilance during the long Golden Week holiday - normally a peak travel(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) period - that runs(#included May 6) through May 6 , calling(#included May 6) on people to stay(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) home and reduce(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) contact(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) with others .
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared(#included April 7) a state of emergency on April 7 , initially for Tokyo , Japan and several other prefectures after a jump in infections , and later extended(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) a state of emergency nationwide .
a state of emergency gives(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) governors greater power to tell(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) people to stay(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) at home and ask(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) businesses to close(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) , but a state of emergency does not mandate(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) penalties in most cases for non - compliance , relying(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) instead on social pressure and respect(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) for authority .
Tokyo , Japan has seen(#included May 6) a decline(#included this week) in daily reported(#included May 6) cases since hitting(#included April 17) a peak of 201 on April 17 , with further falls(#included this week) into double digits this week , but the city ’s governor , Yuriko Koike , has warned(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) residents not to be complacent .
On Friday , the Nippon Foundation , a philanthropic organisation , unveiled(#included Friday) the first part of a field hospital built in a waterside area of Tokyo .
Set(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) up in an arena built(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) for Paralympic sports , the first part of a field hospital built in a waterside area of Tokyo features(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) alcoves containing(#overlap 2020-05-01 09:27:29) a bed , locker and table set(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) apart from each other .
Other beds will be put(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) in tents and expanded(#after 2020-05-01 09:27:29) as needed(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) , NHK reported(#before 2020-05-01 09:27:29) .
The International Olympic Committee and the government in March postponed(#included May 6) the summer Olympic and Paralympic Games for a year , until July 2021 , because of the coronavirus crisis(#included May 6) .
