( Bloomberg ) --
Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman has backed(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) the idea of a wealth tax on the country ’s rich as the nation to fend off creditors and find money to help cope with the Covid-19 pandemic .
a wealth tax on the country ’s rich would affect(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) 11,000 people with fortunes of at least $ 2 million , Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) , without specifying(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) where that cut - off point might come(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman spoke(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) in an interview(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) with journalist Horacio Verbitsky , published(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) on the website El Cohete a la Luna .
President Alberto Fernandez , in a separate interview(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) , spoke(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) of the need for wealth redistribution(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
the country lacks(#overlap 2020-04-19 18:32:07) room for austerity or cutbacks and needs(#overlap 2020-04-19 18:32:07) to reprogram(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) its debt with the International Monetary Fund , Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) , as the country enters(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) crunch(#overlap 2020-04-19 18:32:07) negotiations(#overlap 2020-04-19 18:32:07) with creditors .
the country last week announced(#included April 22 , last week) proposals for a deal that would see it pushing back most of its payments until the next decade .
the country wo n’t be able to deal(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) with the country debt obligations(#before 2023) to the International Monetary Fund until 2023 , Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) , adding(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) that Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman thinks(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) the International Monetary Fund understands(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) that its debt will have to be reorganized(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
Because of the health crisis , it does n’t make(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) sense for countries that have(#overlap 2020-04-19 18:32:07) limited resources to pay(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) creditors , Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
That would make(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) recovery more difficult once the Covid-19 pandemic is over .
Even before the health crisis though , the country was already unable to pay(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) the country debt .
the country had(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) 2,839 confirmed(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) Covid-19 cases and has reported(#after March 20) 132 deaths(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
the country has imposed(#after March 20) a nationwide lockdown(#after March 20) since March 20 , which appears to have helped(#before 2023) flatten(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) the rate of infections .
a deal that would see it pushing back most of its payments until the next decade includes(#included April 16) a three - year moratorium(#included April 16) on all payments(#before 2023) , a 5 % reduction(#included April 16) on principal and a 62 % reduction(#included April 16) in interest payments(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
That ’s the same proposal(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) the country would have made(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) before the Covid-19 pandemic , Argentina’s Economy Minister said(#included April 16) .
the idea of a wealth tax on the country ’s rich as the nation to fend off creditors and find money to help cope with the Covid-19 pandemic comes(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) from lawmakers who had suggested(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) a tax on people with assets of more than $ 3 million .
a tax on people with assets of more than $ 3 million ’s at the official exchange rate of around 66 pesos per dollar .
The blue - chip swap(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) rate , a measure of where the peso would be if the peso were floating(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) , has fallen(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) to 103 pesos per dollar amid speculation the country is preparing(#overlap 2020-04-19 18:32:07) to print(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) more money .
the country needs(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) to develop(#after 2020-04-19 18:32:07) a local - currency funding market so that the country no longer needs(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) to rely(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) so heavily on borrowing in dollars , Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#before 2020-04-19 18:32:07) .
