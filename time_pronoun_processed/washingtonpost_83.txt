“ The future is here , ” says(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) one of the eight intrepid explorers who in 1991 walked(#included 1991) into the sprawling three - acre greenhouse known as Biosphere 2 , for a two - year experiment(#included 1991) in ecology and self - containment ( not to mention(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) interpersonal psychology and power dynamics ) .
Do n’t you know(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) it , you .
“ Spaceship Earth , ” Matt Wolf ’s engaging documentary about a ragtag group of idealists who set(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) out to explore(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the world — and then save(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) it — could n’t be better timed(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) : it , is making(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) it available on streaming(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) because , really , what could be more relevant to the coronavirus lockdown than a chronicle of the 20th century ’s most famous self - quarantine ?
People who remember(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the press hysteria surrounding Biosphere 2 might think(#Depend-on 2020-05-06 16:02:09) of the press hysteria surrounding Biosphere 2 as a spectacular flop , the utopian promise of the sprawling three - acre greenhouse known as Biosphere 2 mission(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) sullied(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) by media spectacle and a few cheats along the way .
Eventually treated(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) like a human diorama by the tourists who traveled(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) to peer(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) at them through the glass triangles of them quarters , the terrestrial astronauts ( terranauts ? ) who volunteered to sequester themselves in a collection of seven mini - biomes were tarred(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) as a naive cult at best , and charlatans at worst .
“ “ Spaceship Earth ” helpfully deconstructs(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) those accusations(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) , first by delving(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) into the project ’s origins in 1960s San Francisco , when a charismatic Oklahoma transplant named John Allen gathered(#included 1960s) a group of bookish , artistically inclined young people to get(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) things going , whether in the form of experimental plays , a farm in New Mexico or an oceangoing ship that a group of bookish , artistically inclined young people built from scratch in Oakland , Calif.
After sailing(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the world , learning(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) about global warming and attracting(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the attention and money of oil scion and environmentalist Ed Bass , a charismatic Oklahoma transplant named John Allen hit(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) upon the idea of launching(#included the) an earthbound test of what might eventually be a colony on Mars or the moon .
Luckily for us , Allen and his colleagues were compulsive recorders of Allen and his colleagues adventures(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) , and one of the Biospherians , a physician named Roy Walford , brought(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) a video camera into the sprawling three - acre greenhouse known as Biosphere 2 .
With a wealth of archival material to work(#after 2020-05-06 16:02:09) with , Matt Wolf does a superb job of sending(#included the) viewers back into the 1980s and 1990s — whose scratchy , juddering(#included the) VHS - era production values and “ Galaxy Quest”-worthy uniforms might be tough on the eyes , but are note - perfect in conjuring(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the time period .
Matt Wolf also interviews(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) as many surviving(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) participants as Matt Wolf can , giving(#included present) “ Spaceship Earth ” a welcome note of self - awareness and perspective ( although no one addresses(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the conspicuous homogeneity of the group ) .
Anyone who fears(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) going(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) stir crazy at a time when going(#included present) to the store is more akin(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) to scrubbing(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) in for surgery than running(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) a light errand will relate(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) when tensions rise(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) and systems begin(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) to break(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) down ; if the Biospherians ’ two - year sojourn(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) in the Arizona desert proved(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) anything , it might be just how much a whiff of fresh air can do .
There ’s a third - act twist involving(#included the) a present - day political figure that is so shocking , and strangely prescient , that divulging(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the details would n’t be sporting(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) .
Suffice it to say(#overlap 2020-05-06 16:02:09) that , in addition to celebrating(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) the energy , enterprise and idealism of America ’s postwar generation , “ “ Spaceship Earth ” provides(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) a sobering primer in how some dreams die(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) , and others are strangled(#before 2020-05-06 16:02:09) mercilessly in others cribs .
