The UK's coronavirus lockdown could be extended(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) for up to six months , with some social - distancing measures(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) potentially lasting(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) beyond six months , the deputy chief medical officer said(#included 2020-04-05) on Sunday .
Under The UK's coronavirus lockdown British people have been told(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) not to leave(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) British people homes unless British people are purchasing(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) essential items or exercising(#overlap 2020-03-30 11:01:12) once a day .
Non - essential shops and places of worship have been closed(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) and weddings(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) and baptisms(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) banned(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) .
Dr Jenny Harries said(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) it would take(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) " two or three months ...
but about three to six months ideally ... to see(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) at which point we can get(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) back to normal .

The UK 's coronavirus lockdown measures could be extended(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) in some form until as late as September with some measures(#before late) lasting(#before late) even beyond extended , one of the government 's medical advisers has indicated(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) .
Dr Jenny Harries said(#included 2020-04-05) on Sunday that The UK 's coronavirus lockdown measures would be reviewed(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) every three weeks for as long as six months , and possibly beyond .
"If The UK 's are successful The UK 's will have squashed(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) the top of that curve which is brilliant , but The UK 's must not then suddenly revert(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) to The UK 's normal way of living , " Dr Jenny Harries said(#included 2020-04-05) at Downing Street 's daily press conference(#included 2020-04-05) on Sunday .
"That would be quite dangerous .
If The UK 's stopped(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) then , all of The UK 's efforts will be wasted(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) and we could potentially see(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) a second peak .
Over time , probably over the next six months , The UK 's will have(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) a three - week review , The UK 's will see(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) where The UK 's 're going(#overlap 2020-03-30 11:01:12) , The UK 's need(#overlap 2020-03-30 11:01:12) to keep(#overlap 2020-03-30 11:01:12) that lid on , and then gradually The UK 's will be able(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) to hopefully adjust(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) some of the social distancing measures(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) and gradually get(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) us all back to normal .
"I think(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) three weeks for review(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) , two or three months to see(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) whether The UK 's 've really squashed(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) it , but about three to six months ideally ... to see(#after 2020-03-30 11:01:12) at which point The UK 's can get(#before 2020-03-30 11:01:12) back to normal .
