( Bloomberg ) --
With airlines still grounding(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) flights(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) , the last thing Europe probably needs(#included right now) right now is a giant cargo of jet fuel .
Yet , a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it is on a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it way from Asia .
a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it is set(#included June 6) to arrive(#included June 6) in Rotterdam on June 6 , adding(#included June 6) to the list of recent tanker shipments(#included right now) of a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it , many of which are still anchored(#included right now) outside Europe ’s ports .
While the coronavirus pandemic has decimated(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) the global market for aviation fuel , production(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) and trading(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) of the coronavirus pandemic across the world ’s oceans continues(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) .
“ In the world of trading(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) , the coronavirus pandemic ’s always about where you can make(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) the margin , ” said(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) Sandra Octavia , an oil products analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd.
If the price in Europe is higher than in Asia -- taking(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) into account things like financing and freight costs -- then , if the price in Europe makes(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) sense , you might ship(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) a cargo , Sandra Octavia , an oil products analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. said(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) .
The aviation fuel market has been so badly hit(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) that The aviation fuel market ’s now cheaper than diesel in Europe , when normally The aviation fuel market ’s more expensive .
That begs(#included right now) the question of what will happen(#after 2020-05-18 19:43:40) to the product aboard the Elandra Denali , a newly built vessel that loaded most of its jet fuel cargo in South Korea in early April .
the Elandra Denali , a newly built vessel that loaded most of its jet fuel cargo in South Korea in early April also took(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) on additional fuel via a ship - to - ship transfer(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) , some of which may not be jet , according to research firm Kpler .
One possibility is that additional fuel will be stored(#after 2020-05-18 19:43:40) and sold(#after 2020-05-18 19:43:40) later at a profit .
The cheapest way to do took is to find(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) an empty tank on land , but it ’s also possible to keep(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) an empty tank on land on the Elandra Denali , a newly built vessel that loaded most of its jet fuel cargo in South Korea in early April for an extended period .
This approach , known as floating storage , is expensive(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) , but if the future prices of a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it are high enough , This approach , known as floating storage , can still be profitable .
Another option is for the cargo to be blended(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) into diesel - type fuel .
Anyone taking(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) This approach , known as floating storage , would have to pay(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) close attention to the specifications of the different products , particularly sulfur content and flash point .
While a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it is notable(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) for a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it sheer size , a supertanker hauling about 2 million barrels of it ’s not alone in bringing(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) jet to Europe .
Tankers stacked(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) with additional fuel are gathered(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) off the coast of the U.K. and Rotterdam .
Some have been there for weeks , a possible indication that Some owners have opted(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) for floating storage .
There is currently no onshore jet fuel storage for hire(#included currently) in Europe , according to Krien van Beek , a broker at ODIN - RVB Tank Storage Solutions .
Gloomy Outlook
Compared(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) to some other oil products , the outlook(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) for jet is far from rosy .
Energy Aspects Ltd. expects(#included currently) demand for additional fuel to still be down by about 60 % from 2019 levels next month , with a recovery not expected(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) until mid - to - late next year .
The Paris - based International Energy Agency sees(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) demand for jet and kerosene falling(#included July) by 1.7 million barrels a day year - on - year each month between July and December , according to The Paris - based International Energy Agency ’s latest monthly report(#included currently) .
Meanwhile , demand for gasoline -- a much bigger market -- is set(#included currently) to drop(#after 2020-05-18 19:43:40) by 550,000 barrels a day .
The expected(#Depend-on 2020-05-18 19:43:40) drop in diesel and gasoil is even smaller(#overlap 2020-05-18 19:43:40) .
“ Gasoline I can see(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) recovery quite strongly and quickly , but not jet fuel , ” said(#before 2020-05-18 19:43:40) I .
