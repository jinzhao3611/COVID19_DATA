Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic , has received(#included last month) a new liver , donated by his uncle .
Doctors at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Denver previously canceled(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) a new liver , donated by his uncle — along with all other organ transplants from living(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) donors — amid concerns that such operations(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) would leave(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) patients and donors vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic .
But UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Denver reversed(#included Monday morning) course last week after developing(#included last week) the capability to test(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) for the coronavirus pandemic in UCHealth ’s lab and get(#included last month) results in under four hours .
All potential living donor transplant patients are being reviewed(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) on a case - by - case basis , examining(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) risks to the donor and recipient , before an appropriate plan of action is determined(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) , ” Dan Weaver , a hospital spokesman , said(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) in an email .
Both Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic , 33 , and Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic uncle , Troy , 45 , tested(#included Monday morning) negative for the coronavirus pandemic Monday morning , giving(#included Monday morning) doctors the green light .
Within hours , transplant surgeons had removed(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) a portion of Troy ’s healthy liver and implanted(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) a portion of Troy ’s healthy liver in his nephew , who was born with a rare disease that caused bile to back up in his body , slowly devastating his liver .
“ Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic is doing great ! ”
his sister , Ashley , wrote(#included Tuesday morning) in a text message Monday morning .
“ Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic said(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) a new liver , donated by his uncle is working(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) great . ”
Doctors had told(#included Tuesday morning) Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic early last month that , without a new liver , donated by his uncle , Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic might have(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) 30 to 45 days to live(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) .
Then , on March 13 , Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic received(#included March 13) word that UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Denver was postponing(#included March 13) the operation , scheduled(#included March 25) for March 25 , citing(#included Tuesday morning) concerns about the coronavirus pandemic .
In the days afterward , Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic made(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) arrangements for home hospice care — unsure whether Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic would need(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) home hospice care .
“ Whatever is meant(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) to be is going(#after 2020-04-07 17:43:27) to be , ” Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic said(#included Tuesday morning) at the time .
“ That ’s the way Zach Branson , a Colorado man whose lifesaving transplant was put on hold last month because of the coronavirus pandemic ’m trying(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) to approach(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) this . ”
the coronavirus pandemic has led(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) hospitals across the United States to cancel(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) or postpone(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) most elective surgeries , seriously disrupting(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) the lives of many awaiting(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) new organs , transplant experts said(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) .
Doctors in some parts of the country say(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) an inability to quickly test(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) potential donors for the coronavirus pandemic has led(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) Doctors in some parts of the country to decline(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) viable organs , forcing(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) some ailing(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) patients to wait(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) longer .
To avert(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) the spread of the coronavirus pandemic among vulnerable patients who must take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of their new organs , doctors have canceled(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) most routine follow(#overlap 2020-04-07 17:43:27) visits(#after 2020-04-07 17:43:27) for transplant recipients .
And in anticipation of a surge(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) of coronavirus patients requiring(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) beds in intensive care units , some hospitals are now performing(#included PRESENT_REF) transplant operations only for patients who are at the most dire risk of death .
performing may mean(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) delaying(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) kidney transplants(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) for patients who can get(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) by on dialysis , or holding(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) off on heart transplants for those surviving(#before 2020-04-07 17:43:27) on mechanical heart pumps .
