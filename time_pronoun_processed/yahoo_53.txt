Coronavirus pandemic ruins(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) outlook for a world of electric and autonomous cars .
2020-04-01 19:59:38 +00:00 .
With Detroit ’s Big Three automakers and Elon Musk ’s Tesla making(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) ventilators to support(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) the coronavirus pandemic(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) relief effort , no doubt the shift(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) to electronic and autonomous cars has suffered(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) a major setback .
For one , electric and hybrid cars are n’t being made(#included right now) right now as plants are shut(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) down to support(#included right now) social distancing(#included right now) .
Who knows(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) when auto production restarts(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) .
Moreover , it ’s unclear(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) what demand will be like for these often more expensive cars when consumers try(#included later this year) to catch(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) up on bills later this year after being laid(#included later this year) off this spring .
Meanwhile , automakers have temporarily halted(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) investments(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) in the technology designed(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) to power(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) the cars of the future ( not to mention a good chunk of automakers advertising for the cars of the future ) .
And last but not least , the plunge(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) in oil prices — which has sent(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) gas prices to below $ 1.00 a gallon in some parts of the country — makes(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) it more attractive for people to own(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) a car with a good old fashioned gas engine .
Take(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) all these factors together , and you see(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) a vastly different road ahead for electric and autonomous cars looking(#included right now) out the next several years .
“ There has been a setback(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) , ” TPG Global senior advisor and former Ford CEO Mark Fields said(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) on Yahoo Finance ’s The First Trade .
TPG Global senior advisor and former Ford CEO Mark Fields is credited(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) with putting(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) Ford on track to play(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) aggressively in the electric and autonomous car future as CEO from 2014 - 2017 .
Add TPG Global senior advisor and former Ford CEO Mark Fields , “ This is going(#after 2020-04-01 19:59:38) to be another casualty , if you will of COVID-19 , in which an environment where you have(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) consumer purchasing power severely impacted(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) .
And the fact that electronic cars are still viewed(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) as luxury items because electronic cars are more expensive than internal combustion engines . ”
TPG Global senior advisor and former Ford CEO Mark Fields is also cautious on how the major automakers will reallocate(#after 2020-04-01 19:59:38) funds during the eventual recovery to autonomous car technology .
“ It does n’t make(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) sense for an automaker to be spending(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) at the same pace on the autonomous future when your number one priority is surviving(#overlap 2020-04-01 19:59:38) the non - autonomous present .
So those investments(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) will be slowing(#after 2020-04-01 19:59:38) down , ” TPG Global senior advisor and former Ford CEO Mark Fields added(#before 2020-04-01 19:59:38) .
