SAN FRANCISCO — In some ways , there could n’t be a worse time than a pandemic to introduce(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) a new gadget .
But Apple unveiled(#included Wednesday) a $399 iPhone on Wednesday anyway , seizing(#included Wednesday) on a time when many of us are sheltering(#included Wednesday) indoors and glued(#included Wednesday) to us devices .
a $399 iPhone arrives(#included Wednesday) with a lower price : At $ 399 , a $399 iPhone costs(#included 2014) about 40 percent less than the regular $ 699 iPhone .
a $399 iPhone has(#included 2014) the design of an older generation of iPhones , with the same computing power as newer ones .
That means a $399 iPhone looks(#included 2014) like an iPhone from 2014 , with a smaller screen and a home button instead of a face scanner , but is as fast as the fancier iPhone 11 from 2019 .
Apple typically holds(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) splashy events to introduce(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) new products .
But because of a pandemic , Apple instead live(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) a product executive showing(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) a slide show of images of a $399 iPhone to make(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) a $399 iPhone announcement .
Apple warned(#included February) in February that production(#included February) would be hampered(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) because the factories were only slowly reopening(#included February) after business was largely shut(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) down because of the coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) there .
Apple said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) Apple sales would also be hurt(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) by slowing(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) consumer demand and closures of Apple retail stores .
At the same time , iPhones and other computing devices — such as iPads and Mac laptops — have become(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) essential tools to many people who are working or learning from their homes under shelter - in - place orders .
become may stoke(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) interest in a new and less - expensive iPhone .
Apple has generally priced(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) its iPhones high and marketed(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) its iPhones as objects of desire(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) , but Apple has taken(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) the budget approach before .
Four years ago , Apple released(#included Four years ago) the first iPhone SE , which also featured an older design with sped - up internals , for $ 399 .
the first iPhone SE , which also featured an older design with sped - up internals , for $ 399 was popular among those who preferred(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) smaller phone screens for a lower price .
Apple was the world ’s No . 1 phone maker in the fourth quarter of 2019 by shipments , according to the research firm IDC .
its iPhones sold(#included February) particularly well in developed(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) regions like the United States .
A lower - priced smartphone gives(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) Apple an opportunity to compete(#after 2020-04-15 17:36:04) in developing(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) markets like India , where people have gravitated(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) toward cheaper phones .
Phil Schiller , Apple ’s head of marketing , said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) in a statement(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) that a $399 iPhone was an improvement(#included Four years ago) from a $399 iPhone predecessor .
a $399 iPhone lacks(#overlap 2020-04-15 17:36:04) some other frills seen(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) in more expensive iPhones .
Notably , the SE ’s main camera has(#included April 24) a single lens capable of producing(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) so - called portrait photos , which involve(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) sharpening subjects in the foreground while gently blurring(#overlap 2020-04-15 17:36:04) the background .
In contrast , the $ 699 iPhone 11 and $ 999 iPhone 11 Pro have(#overlap 2020-04-15 17:36:04) dual- and triple - lens camera systems capable of shooting(#included April 24) better photos in low light and taking(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) shots with a wider field of view .
a $399 iPhone will become(#included April 24) available on April 24 , Apple said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) .
Carolina Milanesi , a consumer technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies , said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) the timing(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) of the SE ’s release(#included fourth quarter of 2019) was unfortunate because many Apple retail stores , where shoppers can try(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) new iPhones before buying(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) new iPhones , were closed(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) .
But people who are struggling(#overlap 2020-04-15 17:36:04) financially because of a pandemic may appreciate(#after 2020-04-15 17:36:04) being able to buy(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) a cheaper iPhone , Carolina Milanesi , a consumer technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies , said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) .
“ The rest of this year and next year might be the best time to have(#after 2020-04-15 17:36:04) something priced(#included April 24) like that in the portfolio , ” Carolina Milanesi , a consumer technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies , said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) .
Apple has said(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) Apple plans(#before 2020-04-15 17:36:04) to use(#after 2020-04-15 17:36:04) its iPhones to help(#after 2020-04-15 17:36:04) halt(#after 2020-04-15 17:36:04) the spread of the coronavirus .
