As the coronavirus case curve flattens, daily deaths(#after 2020-05-10 13:35:58) may stay(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) high, experts warn(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) .

Even as the coronavirus case curve flattens in certain regions , the number of deaths(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) can continue(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to rise(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) .
"It takes(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) two to three weeks after infection for a person to be in critical condition or to die(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , so death curves generally follow(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) along behind infection curves , something like one to two weeks delayed(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , " Benjamin Neuman , chair of biological sciences at Texas A University - Texarkana , told(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) Business Insider .

the coronavirus case curve seems(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to have plateaued(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) .
But the number of deaths(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) is unlikely to drop(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) as soon as spread is in decline(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) .
The US 's number of new daily coronavirus cases hit(#included April 24) a peak on April 24 with more than 38,000 Americans testing(#included April 24) positive for the virus .
On Friday , more than 29,000 new cases were reported(#included Friday) .
But experts warn(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) that a drop in the amount of new daily infections does not necessarily lead(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to an immediate drop in the number of daily deaths(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , since it takes(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) weeks for people diagnosed(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) with COVID-19 to exhibit(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) severe symptoms .
Once a person is infected , the virus lingers(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) for a long time .
" COVID-19 is a rather slow disease , Benjamin Neuman , chair of biological sciences at Texas A University - Texarkana , told(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) Business Insider .
" It takes(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) two to three weeks after infection for a person to be in critical condition or to die(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , so death curves generally follow(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) along behind infection curves , something like one to two weeks delayed(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) .

Why the lag in numbers ?
The trend Benjamin Neuman , chair of biological sciences at Texas A University - Texarkana , describes(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) was clear in South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March .
Even as new coronavirus cases were starting(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to flatten(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March witnessed(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) a spike in South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March number of daily deaths(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) .
On March 3 , South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March reported(#included March 3) 851 daily new cases — South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March highest in a single day — and four deaths(#included March 3) .
But South Korea 's highest daily death toll was recorded(#included roughly three weeks later) roughly three weeks later , on March 24 , when nine people died(#included March 24) of COVID-19 in South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March .
A similar process has happened(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) in New York .
In early April , Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported(#included early April) that South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March was flattening(#included March 3) South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March curve .
reported has proven(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) true , but a month later , South Korea , which became the second - most infected country after China in early March continues(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to record(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) a drop in the number of new daily cases while reporting(#included a month later) a substantial number of deaths(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) each day .
During a press conference(#included March 3) on March 3 , Gov. Andrew Cuomo said(#included March 3) South Korea 's highest daily death toll has remained(#included March 3) " obnoxiously and terrifyingly high . "

It 's going(#after 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to seem(#after 2020-05-10 13:35:58) as though things are getting(#after 2020-05-10 13:35:58) better and worse at the same time , which is going(#after 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to be confusing(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) for a lot of people , " Benjamin Neuman , chair of biological sciences at Texas A University - Texarkana , said(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , adding(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , " case numbers lag(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) about a week behind reality .
" This death - rate trend could change(#before 2020-05-10 13:35:58) , however , as new treatments(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) are developed(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) and doctors and researchers continue(#overlap 2020-05-10 13:35:58) to learn(#after 2020-05-10 13:35:58) more about the virus .
Earlier this month , the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this month issued(#included Earlier this month) an emergency use authorization for the antiviral drug remdesivir .
