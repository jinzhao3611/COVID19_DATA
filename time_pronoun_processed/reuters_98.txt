LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Investors rushed(#included the past week) into cash and out of bonds at a record pace over the past week as the coronavirus pandemic(#included the past week) caused(#included the past week) mayhem in markets , BofA said(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday , though BofA noted(#included 2020-04-03) a key positioning(#included 2020-04-03) signal at “ maximum bearish ” could signal(#included 2020-04-03) a big rally ahead .

BofA ’s weekly fund flows(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) data based(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) on figures from EPFR Global showed(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) a record $ 234.6 billion had made(#included January 30 , 2019) their way into cash funds in the past week while another record of $ 109 billion was registered(#included the past month) in redemptions(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) from bond funds(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) .
Bank of America noted(#included 2020-04-03) record $ 61.2 billion outflow(#included 2020-04-03) from investment grade debt and “ monster ” $ 17.1 billion outflows(#included 2020-04-03) from emerging(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) bonds .
Bond outflows(#included January 30 , 2019) totalled(#included past week) a “ stunning(#included past week) ” $ 218 billion in the past two weeks and $ 257 billion over the past month , Bank of America noted(#included 2020-04-03) .
“ The bond bubble pops(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) , ” Bank of America said(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) , adding(#included 2020-04-03) the past four weeks ’ redemptions had unwound(#included the past month) 44 % of “ bubble inflows(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) of $ 583 billion in the past two weeks . ”
Equity funds meanwhile shed(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) $ 26.2 billion , with U.S. share funds down $ 15.8 billion , Bank of America showed(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) .
Bank of America , however , does not capture(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) the market rebound seen(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) in the past three sessions(#included past week) that boosted(#included 2020-04-03) New York ’s Dow Jones on Friday to New York ’s Dow Jones biggest one - day rise(#included the past month) since 1933 , thanks to central banks promising(#included 2020-04-03) “ whatever it takes(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) ” to ensure(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) liquidity and a $ 2 trillion U.S. coronavirus relief bill .
Before that , between February 19 and March 23 , an MSCI index of world stocks , fell(#before 2020-03-27) about 35 % .
BofA said(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) its Bull Bear Indicator - a key market measure it used to track positioning - had hit(#included Tuesday) zero , a level BofA described(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) as “ maximum bearish ” .
hit potentially implies(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) a substantial rebound(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) in credit and stock markets if the stimulus plans of the Federal Reserve and U.S. succeed(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) , BofA added(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) .
succeed could be borne(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) out by the present rally , which was undeterred even after Thursday data showing(#included past week) nearly 3.3 million Americans had filed(#included past week) for unemployment benefits in the past week , eclipsing(#included the past month) the previous record of 695,000 set(#included the past month) in 1982 .
BofA also said(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) the equity allocations of BofA private clients had fallen(#after 1933) to 52.8 % , the lowest since February 2013 .
While Bank of America shows(#overlap 2020-03-27 17:33:54) how deep the incoming recession will likely be , some investors are hoping(#overlap 2020-03-27 17:33:54) that additional stimulus(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) from the Donald Trump administration will further cushion(#after 2020-03-27 17:33:54) the blow .
BofA noted(#after 1933) its Bull Bear Indicator - a key market measure it used to track positioning - had hit(#included the past two weeks) zero in July 2008 but that rally had been aborted(#included the past two weeks) by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy(#included past week) four weeks later .
“ The big difference in this crash(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) is that policy panic(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) ( happened(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) ) before not after the credit event ; if the Federal Reserve bazooka short(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) a systemic bankruptcy(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) , the combo of max bearish positioning and max policy stimulus equate(#before 2020-03-27 17:33:54) to big rally in credit and stock markets , ” Bank of America added .
