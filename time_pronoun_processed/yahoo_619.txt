Lessons from Colombia kidnap(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) ordeal(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) ease(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt pandemic(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) fears .
2020-05-02 07:02:21 +00:00 .
More than six years in captivity at the hands of Colombian guerrillas provided(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) a crash course in confinement that Betancourt says(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) has steeled(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt for life under lockdown(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) .
Betancourt says(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt can tap(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) into that hard - won experience now that Betancourt is confined(#included PRESENT_REF) to a house alone in Oxford , England , where Betancourt is studying(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) for a PhD in theology .
Betancourt spent(#included 2002) six and a half years deep in the Colombian jungle , a prisoner of FARC rebels , following(#included 2002) her kidnap in 2002 .
" Betancourt spent(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) years isolated(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) from Betancourt colleagues during her kidnap in 2002 so let 's say(#included PRESENT_REF) this is something Betancourt already know(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) . "
Betancourt has quickly established(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) a routine under lockdown in England , getting(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) up , starting(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) work , and taking(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) breaks , including(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) going(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) for a run , at the same time every day .
" That format balances(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt a lot because Betancourt can feel(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) what Betancourt 'm doing is productive .
Betancourt do not feel(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) alone . "
Key to it all is what Betancourt calls(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) " space management . "
" When Betancourt was in captivity , Betancourt had(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt neck tied(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to a tree .
When you are tied(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) up , the space you have(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) available to move(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) around is very limited(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) . "
- Changing(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) places - "
What Betancourt did is that Betancourt compartmentalized(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) it , so Betancourt had(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) a space where Betancourt used(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to eat , Betancourt moved(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) with the chain to another space to do a physical exercise routine , Betancourt moved(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to another space just to read and think(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) .
Betancourt always changed(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) places .
And changed helped(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt feel freer because Betancourt could choose(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) where Betancourt was .
choose is something Betancourt do at the moment . "
Having(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) a clear mind is important in the current crisis(#included current) , Betancourt says(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) .
" Betting(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) that things are going(#after 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to turn(#after 2020-05-02 07:02:21) out in the best way ...
That does not exempt(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) one from having(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) terrible moments , but despite the pain(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , when time passes(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) and one looks(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) back , one realizes(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) that very positive things remain(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) . "
Betancourt 's father died(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) during Betancourt years of captivity(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , exposing(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt to a similar situation to people who are now unable to say a final goodbye to their relatives because of fears over the spread of the coronavirus .
" When Betancourt learned(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) in the Colombian jungle , a prisoner of FARC rebels that Betancourt 's father had died(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , Betancourt practically went(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) crazy but you have to breathe(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) .
You learn(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to continue(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) living(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , to breathe(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , to eat(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , to walk(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) ... to continue(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) existing(#overlap 2020-05-02 07:02:21) . "
Difficult as it may seem(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , there are benefits to the pandemic(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) , says(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) Betancourt , and lessons to be learned(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) .
" When they return(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to normal life , they are going(#after 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to have(#after 2020-05-02 07:02:21) the feeling that there are things in this life of confinement that they are not going(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to want(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to lose(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) .
" they can get(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) out of the urgency of always running(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) after things .
Suddenly everything stops(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) and you start(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to think(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) ' Is all this so necessary ? ' " " Do I have to be running(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) up and down or can I find(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) a formula where I can manage(#before 2020-05-02 07:02:21) to be the owner of I own life ?
