MUMBAI ( Reuters ) -
Amazon Prime Video , Amazon ’s streaming service , will screen(#included this month) several new Indian films originally meant for theatrical release this month , sparking(#included this month) protests(#included this month) from cinema owners as the novel coronavirus outbreak upends(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) Bollywood .
India has been under a strict lockdown(#included April) since March 25 to battle(#after March 25) the novel coronavirus outbreak , leaving(#after March 25) about 9,500 theatres shut(#after March 25) and depriving(#after March 25) Bollywood of box - office revenue .
So producers of seven films , including(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) two Bollywood movies starring(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) A - listers , such as Amitabh Bachchan and Vidya Balan , will stream(#after 2020-05-15 07:04:43) several new Indian films originally meant for theatrical release this month directly on Amazon Prime Video , Amazon ’s streaming service following(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) a deal , Amazon Prime Video , Amazon ’s streaming service said(#included Friday) in a statement(#included Friday) on Friday .
“ Gulabo Sitabo ” , a family comedy with Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana , which was set(#included April) for release(#included April) in April , will now stream(#included June) directly on Amazon Prime Video , Amazon ’s streaming service in June , as will “ Shakuntala Devi ” , a biopic of the Indian mathematician of the same name .
Two of India ’s biggest cinema chains , Inox and PVR , who were meant(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) to screen(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) “ Gulabo Sitabo ” , bemoaned(#included Friday) the decision(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) .
“ INOX will be constrained(#after 2020-05-15 07:04:43) to examine(#after 2020-05-15 07:04:43) INOX options , and reserves(#overlap 2020-05-15 07:04:43) all rights , including(#included June) taking(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) retributive measures , in dealing(#overlap 2020-05-15 07:04:43) with such fair - weather friends , ” Inox said(#included Friday) in a statement(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) .
The producers ’ guild said(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) the comments(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) from Inox were “ abrasive and unconstructive ” .
PVR chief executive Kamal Gianchandani told(#included Thursday) the Indian Express on Thursday , after Amazon announced(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) Amazon would stream(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) “ Gulabo Sitabo ” , that PVR chief executive Kamal Gianchandani was disappointed(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) by the news .

Streaming(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) platforms like Amazon and Netflix have in the past signed(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) deals(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) with Indian studios for digital rights , but mainstream releases have always prioritised(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) theatrical revenues first .
In China , regulators aim(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) to protect(#overlap 2020-05-15 07:04:43) the prolific , southern - language film industry by enforcing(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) rules to stop(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) movies premiering(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) online , in particular by strictly managing(#overlap 2020-05-15 07:04:43) “ theatrical window period ” requirements , a period for movies to be screened(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) in cinemas before movies can be shown(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) elsewhere .
But analysts say(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) the Amazon deal is likely the beginning of a broader trend , as lingering(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) fears of coronavirus infection and lower discretionary spending keep(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) people away from multiplexes and single - screen cinemas .
“ There will be a reset(#after 2020-05-15 07:04:43) in the way that producers and studios think(#after 2020-05-15 07:04:43) about producers and studios portfolios , ” Vijay Subramaniam , director and head , Content , Amazon Prime Video , India , told(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) Reuters in an interview(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) .
Vijay Subramaniam , director and head , Content , Amazon Prime Video , India said(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) Amazon did not see(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) acquisition(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) costs going(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) up for Amazon Prime Video , Amazon ’s streaming service .
Bollywood is a huge draw for India ’s burgeoning online audiences , who - driven(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) by cheap data and smartphones - are spending(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) more time watching(#included Thursday) content online than ever before .
Media reported(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) that more producers in Bollywood and the southern - language industry were in talks(#included Thursday) with streaming platforms for direct - to - digital releases(#before 2020-05-15 07:04:43) .
