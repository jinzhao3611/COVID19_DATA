Call(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) for isolated(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) Britons to help(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) digitise(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) historical rainfall data .
2020-03-26 07:02:29 +00:00 .
Weather is a perennial(#Depend-on 2020-03-26 07:02:29) British obsession(#overlap 2020-03-26 07:02:29) , with some of the country ’s rainfall and temperature records going(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) back centuries .
Some of historical rainfall data has been invaluable in drawing(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) up detailed pictures of the British climate , which have been influential in computer models used(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) to forecast(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) climate change .
But some of historical rainfall data is still effectively unusable because historical rainfall data is marooned(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) in reams of old - fashioned paper records .
Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning(#included Now) to rescue(#included Now) reams of old - fashioned paper records , using(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) citizen scientists to do the work(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) .
scientists at the University of Reading hope(#included Now) that hundreds of people currently stuck(#included Now) indoors with little else to do will be inspired(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) to join(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) up to help(#included currently) digitise(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) rainfall data for use by meteorologists and climate experts .
Under the Rainfall Rescue project , volunteers will fill(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing(#included the 1820s) observations(#included the 1820s) from scans of the old paper records .
“ We are set(#included currently) to reach(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) in time to rescue(#included currently) millions of pieces of UK rainfall data that are currently going(#included currently) to waste(#included currently) in filing cabinets , ” said(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) Ed Hawkins , a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading .
“ reams of old - fashioned paper records will help(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) scientists better understand(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) how and why rainfall varies(#included the) so much in different locations across the UK .
With much of the population facing(#overlap 2020-03-26 07:02:29) long spells indoors due to Covid-19 , the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) a welcome distraction . ”
Thanks to Britain ’s weather obsession , there are records from several thousand rainfall gauges sited(#included the) across the country from the 1950s alone , but only a few hundred have been digitised(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) so far .
The UK ’s variable climate , which scientists recently suggested(#included recently) was responsible for disguising(#included recently) some of the impacts(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) of the climate crisis(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) while the impacts(#overlap 2020-03-26 07:02:29) in other parts of the world are growing(#overlap 2020-03-26 07:02:29) more obvious , makes(#included recently) it crucial to understand(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) why some parts of the UK are wetter or drier than others and to discern(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) long - term trends .
For instance , extreme years – a year - long drought in 1921 and the notoriously wet summer of 1912 – can tell(#included currently) scientists a lot , and scientists understanding will be vastly improved(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) if the weather sources from extreme years – a year - long drought in 1921 and the notoriously wet summer of 1912 can be viewed(#included currently) at last .
Water companies and government planners will also benefit(#after 2020-03-26 07:02:29) , as the resilience of current systems can be compared(#included currently) with real historical conditions .
the Rainfall Rescue project is the biggest such project yet , and Ed Hawkins , a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading hopes(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) to amass(#included 1921) as near complete a record as possible from the 1820s to the 1960s , when digitised records began(#included 1921) .
There have been three previous weather rescue projects , in which volunteers transcribed(#before 2020-03-26 07:02:29) measurements(#included the) from a weather station on top of Ben Nevis and early Victorian records .
