The initiative(#before 2020-03-23 22:27:36) by Spain ’s Santander in terms of market value could pressure(#before 2020-03-23 22:27:36) other European banks to follow(#before 2020-03-23 22:27:36) suit with similar measures(#before 2020-03-23 22:27:36) as large companies , small and mid - sized businesses and households grapple(#overlap 2020-03-23 22:27:36) with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak .
