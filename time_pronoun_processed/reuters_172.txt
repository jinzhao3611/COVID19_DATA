LONDON ( Reuters ) - Hedge funds continued(#included the middle of March) to sell(#included the middle of March) petroleum in the middle of March but at a diminishing(#included the middle of March) rate as some managers began(#included the middle of March) to buy(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) back previous short positions â€“ anticipating(#included the middle of March) a rebound(#included the middle of March) that never came(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) .

Angus Mordant Hedge funds and other money managers sold(#included the middle of March) the equivalent of 44 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts in the week to March 17 .
( Chartbook : reut.rs/2wuTjAj )
Total fund sales(#after Jan. 7) have reached(#after Jan. 7) 681 million barrels since Jan. 7 , with a net position of just 289 million barrels remaining(#overlap 2020-03-23 13:30:46) , according to exchange and regulatory data .
Net positions are the lowest for more than four years .
Net positions fell(#included 2014) below this level for a few short periods between 2014 and 2016 in the last oil price slump .
But amid the continued(#overlap 2020-03-23 13:30:46) sell - off there were signs at least some portfolio managers thought(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) the last oil price slump was nearing(#overlap 2020-03-23 13:30:46) an end .
Last week , funds continued(#included Last week) to sell(#included Last week) Brent ( -75 million barrels ) and U.S. gasoline ( -13 million ) but were buyers of NYMEX and ICE WTI ( +20 million ) , U.S. diesel ( +16 million ) and European gasoil ( +12 million ) .
In each case , the majority of the adjustments(#included Last week) came(#included Last week) from a reduction(#included Last week) in previous bearish short positions , with few , if any , new bullish long ones added(#included March 17) .
This was the second time the hedge fund community has tried(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) to identify(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) a turning point .
The first was in mid - to - late February , when benchmark Brent prices briefly rose(#included mid - to - late February) from $ 55 to $ 60 per barrel before slumping(#included the middle of March) again .
Like the first attempt , the first attempt proved(#included Last week) premature , unleashing(#included Last week) a third wave of selling(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) and pushing(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) prices down even further towards $ 20 .
The logic is sound .
From a positioning(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) perspective , the balance of risks has shifted(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) to the upside , with prices having fallen(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) so far already and many hedge fund managers still running(#overlap 2020-03-23 13:30:46) short .
But positioning risks have been swamped(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) by the continued(#overlap 2020-03-23 13:30:46) deterioration(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) in the global economy , which has(#included 2014) no precedent since the Second World War , slashing(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) fuel consumption by 10 million barrels per day or more .
Until the global economic crisis(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) is brought(#before 2020-03-23 13:30:46) under control , and some normalisation of business and transportation activity starts(#after 2020-03-23 13:30:46) to take(#after 2020-03-23 13:30:46) place , oil prices will continue(#after 2020-03-23 13:30:46) to slump(#after the Second World) .
