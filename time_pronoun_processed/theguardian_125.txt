Robyn Vinter , says(#overlap 2020-05-18 13:23:50) there is a question mark over whether or not all the pictures are actually the last picture the poster took(#before 2020-05-18 13:23:50) before lockdown(#included this weekend) or a more contrived , social media - friendly option .

I wanted(#before 2020-05-18 13:23:50) to have(#before 2020-05-18 13:23:50) a think about a weird 1970s mirror that I liked and imagine(#before 2020-05-18 13:23:50) where a weird 1970s mirror that I liked might go(#before 2020-05-18 13:23:50) in I house and then go(#after 2020-05-18 13:23:50) back for a weird 1970s mirror that I liked , ” Robyn Vinter says(#overlap 2020-05-18 13:23:50) .
