Although North Korea ’s government insists(#overlap 2020-05-06 11:55:15) North Korea ’s government has(#overlap 2020-05-06 11:55:15) no confirmed(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) cases of the novel coronavirus , North Korea ’s government has repeatedly emphasized(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) the threat to North Korea ’s government from the disease North Korea ’s government causes(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) , covid-19 .

“ It can not be ruled(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) out that there has been an outbreak(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) in South Korea , ” Kim Byung - kee of the ruling Democratic Party said(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) .
“ Kim Jong Un had focused(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) on consolidating(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) internal affairs such as military forces and party - state meetings , and coronavirus concerns have further limited(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) Kim Jong Un public activity . ”
the NIS said(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) the prolonged closure of the border between the two countries has added(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) to the economic hardships of North Korean people and temporarily pushed(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) up the price of imports such as spices and sugar , as well as the dollar ’s exchange rate against the local currency .
That , in turn , caused(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) an outbreak(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) of panic(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) buying(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) among South Korea residents , the NIS said(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) , which provided(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) more fuel for the rumor mill surrounding(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) Kim ’s health .

Meanwhile , there is no sign of a slowdown(#before 2020-05-06 11:55:15) in North Korea ’s efforts to improve(#overlap 2020-05-06 11:55:15) North Korea ’s missile defense capability , with weapons tests(#included this year) continuing(#included this year) at a rapid pace this year .
