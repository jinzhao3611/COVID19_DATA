“ The actual impact(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) of the virus on macro economies is much harder to gauge(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) right now than pricing the impacts(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) on specific industries in equities , or pricing in the reactions(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) of different central banks , ” said(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) Monex Europe FX analyst Simon Harvey .

Investors have sought(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) ways to factor(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) in the coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) and growing(#overlap 2020-02-26 15:04:31) risks of a technical recession(#before 2020-02-26 15:04:31) in Italy and Japan .
