( Updates with total cuts for Azerbaijan )
By Olga Yagova and Dmitry Zhdannikov MOSCOW / LONDON , April 23 ( Reuters ) - Azerbaijan ’s BP - led Azeri - Chirag - Guneshli ( ACG ) project will have to cut(#included 2019-05) output sharply from May for the first time ever as Azerbaijan moves to meet Azerbaijan commitment under a global deal to cut production , four sources told Reuters on Thursday .
Oil majors operating(#overlap 2020-04-23 19:16:07) large production sharing deals in the ex - Soviet states of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have been previously excluded(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) from any government - imposed production decisions(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) because such foreign investment(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) is highly - prized .
But the scale of a global deal to cut production has made(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) it impossible for Azerbaijan to cut(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) output without imposing(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) restrictions(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) on BP and BP partner shareholders , which include(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) Hungary ’s MOL , U.S. ExxonMobil , Norway ’s Equinor and Japan ’s Inpex .
BP , which as the leading(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) shareholder speaks(#overlap 2020-04-23 19:16:07) for ACG , and the Azeri energy ministry both declined(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) to comment(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) .
The development(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) will be closely watched(#after 2020-04-23 19:16:07) in countries such as OPEC members Nigeria , Angola and Iraq and non - members like Kazakhstan and Russia , where oil majors have long escaped(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) making(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) cuts , citing(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) contract agreements(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) .
Azerbaijan is not a member of OPEC but is a part of a wider group known(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) as OPEC+ , which led(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) by Saudi Arabia on the OPEC side and Russia for other producers outside OPEC .
The third largest oil producer among ex - Soviet countries , after Russia and Kazakhstan , needs(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) to cut(#after 2020-04-23 19:16:07) output by a total of 164,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) to 554,000 bpd for two months from May under a global deal to cut production .
Of this , giant offshore ACG fields in the Caspian Sea will be required to cut(#included 2019-05) some 75,000 - 80,000 bpd from May , sources told(#overlap 2020-04-23 19:16:07) Reuters .
required accounts(#overlap 2020-04-23 19:16:07) for about 15 % of ACG ’s output , Reuters calculations(#overlap 2020-04-23 19:16:07) show(#overlap 2020-04-23 19:16:07) .
The ACG consortium reported(#included last year) production(#included last year) of 535,000 bpd on average last year and planned(#included 2020) to maintain(#included 2020) 535,000 bpd in 2020 .
Older onshore Azeri fields , which have been producing(#after around 1900s) oil since around 1900s , will contribute(#after 2020-04-23 19:16:07) the remaining cuts .
“ Proportionally , onshore fields will cut(#after 2020-04-23 19:16:07) much more because onshore fields have(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) higher costs , ” one of four sources said(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) .
cut will result(#after 2020-04-23 19:16:07) in a drop in oil exports via the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline through Georgia and Turkey , Azerbaijan ’s main oil export route , four sources said(#before 2020-04-23 19:16:07) .
