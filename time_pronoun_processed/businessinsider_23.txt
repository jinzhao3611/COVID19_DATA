J&J is accelerating(#overlap 2020-03-31 23:07:03) the timeline for its coronavirus vaccine, , saying(#included 2020-03-30) a coronavirus vaccine could be available for emergency(#included 2021) use by early next year .
Johnson & Johnson said(#included 2020-03-30) Monday Johnson & Johnson has selected(#included 2020-03-30) a lead vaccine candidate and plans(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) to start(#included 2021) testing(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) a lead vaccine candidate in people no later than September .
Johnson & Johnson also pledged(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) Johnson & Johnson will ramp up manufacturing(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) to supply(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) 1 billion doses of a vaccine to The world 's .
a coronavirus vaccine would be affordable to the public " on a not - for - profit basis for emergency pandemic(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) use , " Johnson & Johnson stated(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) .
Previously , Johnson & Johnson said(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) Johnson & Johnson was aiming(#included 2020-11) to start(#included 2020-11) clinical trials(#included 2020-11) in November .

Johnson & Johnson announced(#included 2020-03-30) Monday an accelerated(#included 2020-03-30) timeline that could lead(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) to a coronavirus vaccine that 's ready for emergency use in early 2021 .
J 's said(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) J 's has identified(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) a lead vaccine candidate .
Testing(#included 2020-09) should begin(#included the fall) by the fall and produce(#included 2020-09) clinical results on safety and efficacy by the end of 2020 , J 's said(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) .
Johnson & Johnson are moving(#included 2020-11) on an accelerated(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) timeline toward Phase 1 human clinical trials(#included 2020-09) at the latest by September 2020 and , supported(#included 2020-09) by the global production(#included 2020-09) capability that Johnson & Johnson are scaling(#included 2020-11) up in parallel to human testing , Johnson & Johnson expect(#included 2021) a vaccine could be ready(#included 2021) for emergency use in early 2021 , " said(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) Paul Stoffels , J 's chief scientific officer , in a statement .

J 's has been researching(#after 2020-01) the genetic sequence of a coronavirus vaccine that 's ready for emergency use in early 2021 since January in partnership with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center .
After producing(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) several vaccines , several vaccines were tested(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) to identify(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) the most promising ones at causing(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) an immune response(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) .
The vaccine 's development is also being supported(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) .
J 's and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) have committed(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) more than $ 1 billion to The vaccine 's development , J 's stated(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) .
The update(#included 2020-11) shortens(#included 2020-11) an already quick timeline for vaccine development(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) , Previously , J 's said(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) J 's was aiming(#included 2020-11) to start(#included 2020-11) testing(#included 2020-11) a coronavirus vaccine in humans in November .

There are more than 40 ongoing research programs(#overlap 2020-03-31 23:07:03) for a coronavirus vaccine .
All are attempting(#overlap 2020-03-31 23:07:03) to speed(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) up the lengthy development process to halt(#after 2020-03-31 23:07:03) a coronavirus vaccine , and the speediest efforts have already started(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) to be tested(#before 2020-03-31 23:07:03) in humans in record time .
