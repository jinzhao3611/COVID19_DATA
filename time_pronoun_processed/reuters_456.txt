“ military - grade assault weapons were designed(#before 2020-05-01 18:35:23) for one purpose and one purpose only : to kill(#before 2020-05-01 18:35:23) the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time , ” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said(#included Friday) at a daily media briefing(#included Friday) in Ottawa .

Families and friends of gun violence victims “ deserve(#overlap 2020-05-01 18:35:23) more than thoughts and prayers , ” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said(#included Friday) .
a ban will become(#after 2020-05-01 18:35:23) effective immediately by changing(#after 2020-05-01 18:35:23) government regulations , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said(#before 2020-05-01 18:35:23) .

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s Liberal party campaigned(#included October) in October ’s federal election(#included October) on a promise(#included October) to bring(#after 2020-05-01 18:35:23) in stricter gun control .
