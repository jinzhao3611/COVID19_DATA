The rescheduling of accounts classified(#included 2019-12) as overdue , stressed(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) or as on December 2019 without being downgraded(#included 2019-12) , and fresh funding ( with a minimum repayment period of 18 to 24 months ) is to be considered(#after 2020-04-05 16:39:16) .
This may include(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) going(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) easy on the insistence(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) for additional collateral as a pre - condition by The NPA delinquency relaxation to 180 days “ may be heavily qualified(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) to prevent(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) The NPA delinquency relaxation abuse(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) ” , said(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) a source .
The staggered(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) NPA relaxation glide path can be expected(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) to have(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) ‘ start - stop dates ’(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) , which will finally settle(#included 2020) down to the current 90 - day timeline by the close(#included 2020) of 2020 - 21 .

A key concern is that the three - month moratorium on term loans by the central bank , and the central bank linkage to the account being ‘ regular ’ to avail(#overlap 2020-04-05 16:39:16) of the same , may lead(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) to a situation wherein weaker borrowers come(#overlap 2020-04-05 16:39:16) under even more stress .
“ weaker borrowers may default(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) and get(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) downgraded(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) as under the current norms due to weaker borrowers inability to service(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) the interest component on which there is no breather , ” said(#before 2020-04-05 16:39:16) a source .
“ This is especially since sales(#included 2019-12) in the June 2020 quarter will be extremely poor .
