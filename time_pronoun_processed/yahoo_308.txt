A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California was scheduled(#included Wednesday night) to arrive(#included Wednesday night) in San Francisco on Wednesday night , but officials requested(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) that A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California delay(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California return(#included Wednesday night) while the US coast guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coordinated(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) testing(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) .
The plan was for A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California to remain(#included 21 February) in international waters off coast of San Francisco while a helicopter flew(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) tests(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) on board and then returned(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) the samples to a laboratory for testing(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) .
In addition to the 21 people reporting(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) flu - like symptoms , officials planned(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) to test(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) the 62 passengers from the Mexico trip who remained on board for the Hawaii journey , as well as an unknown number of crew .

In total the US coast guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:29:37) to track(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) down about 2,500 people throughout California who disembarked(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) from A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California and could be at risk .

“ We ’re going(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) through that manifest and obviously the concern around people being on a tour(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) that all travel(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:29:37) together , not just on A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California , but were also transported(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) together , highlights(#overlap 2020-03-05 04:29:37) the need to focus with more acuity on those who may have been in closer contact(#before 2020-03-05 04:29:37) with the individual who tragically passed(#included Wednesday) away . ”
