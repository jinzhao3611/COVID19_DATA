The inflation outlook has been thrown(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) into turmoil by the economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic , with restrictions(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) to limit(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) the spread of the coronavirus pandemic forcing(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) non - essential stores to close(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) .
Bank of England policy maker Silvana Tenreyro said(#included last week) last week that it will be hard to interpret(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) inflation data during the economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic as price collection becomes(#included PRESENT_REF) far more difficult and spending patterns shift(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) .
Nonetheless , inflation will probably fall(#included coming months) below 1 % in coming(#Depend-on 2020-04-22 07:26:32) months – - less than half of the central bank ’s target , Bank of England policy maker Silvana Tenreyro said(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) .

Most of the CPI data was collected(#included March) on or around March 17 , the day after Britons were urged(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) to stay(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) at home but before Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed(#included March) a formal lockdown(#included March) on March 23 .
the Office for National Statistics statistician Philip Gooding said(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) panic buying(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) made(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) items such as flour , eggs and pasta more difficult to price(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) than usual .
Collectors were also more reliant(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) on prices posted(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) online as visits(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) to stores were scaled(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) back .
Economists expect(#overlap 2020-04-22 07:26:32) inflation to come(#included coming months) under further pressure in March as a reduction(#included February) in the regulated(#before 2020-04-22 07:26:32) energy price cap makes(#included coming months) gas and electricity cheaper .
