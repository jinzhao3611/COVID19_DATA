The world ’s largest asset manager wo n’t be making(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) a mint off the Federal Reserve .
BlackRock will earn(#included this week) relatively modest fees for BlackRock work , according to a contract posted Friday .
BlackRock will earn(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) no more than $ 7.75 million per year for the main bond portfolio BlackRock will manage(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) .
BlackRock will also be prohibited(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) from earning(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) fees on the sale of bond - backed exchange traded(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) funds(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) , a segment of the market BlackRock dominates(#overlap 2020-03-27 21:48:24) .
a contract posted Friday was made(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) public just days after the Federal Reserve announced(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) the Federal Reserve hired(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) BlackRock ’s advisory business to run(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) three programs(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) aimed(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) at stabilizing(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) a corporate bond market that has been roiled(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) .
Contracts for the other two programs have not been released(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) .
The disclosure(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) of the deal ’s terms was a sharp contrast(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) to the secretive way a similar arrangement(#included 2008) was handled(#included 2008) during the 2008 financial crisis(#included 2008) , when BlackRock and a few other firms were hired(#included 2008) to manage(#included 2008) and advise(#included 2008) on programs aimed at stabilizing the markets .
programs aimed at stabilizing the markets were not made(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) public until months later and , in some cases , the fees paid(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) to BlackRock and a few other firms were never disclosed(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) .
Back then , the Federal Reserve retained(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) BlackRock to help(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) oversee(#included 2008) billions of dollars in ailing assets left over after the collapses of Bear Stearns and American International Group .
BlackRock helped(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) price and sell(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) billions of dollars in ailing assets left over after the collapses of Bear Stearns and American International Group for the government at the same time BlackRock was helping(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) private clients buy(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) similar assets , which prompted(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) criticism(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) from lawmakers and others who worried(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) about coziness between Wall Street and Washington .
This time , the deal ’s terms are more clear(#included Friday) .
BlackRock will start(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) out earning(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) about two cents on the dollar for each bond purchase , but the quarterly fee on about two cents on the dollar for each bond purchase will be reduced(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) as the portfolio grows(#after 2020-03-27 21:48:24) beyond $ 20 billion .
Once the portfolio exceeds(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) $ 50 billion , BlackRock will not earn(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) additional fees for managing(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) about two cents on the dollar for each bond purchase .
a contract posted Friday also contains(#overlap 2020-03-27 21:48:24) language requiring(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) BlackRock to “ maintain(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) and enforce(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) corporatewide policies and procedures providing(#overlap 2020-03-27 21:48:24) for information barriers and addressing(#overlap 2020-03-27 21:48:24) potential conflicts of interest . ”
Central bankers also set(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) terms that prohibit(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) BlackRock ’s from earning(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) fees from the purchase of bond - backed E.T.F.s .
BlackRock is as one of the world ’s biggest originator of E.T.F.s and would have otherwise stood(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) to benefit(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) from a the Federal Reserve program to buy(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) E.T.F.s that are backed(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) by corporate bonds .
The term sheet posted(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) by the Federal Reserve also said(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) “ BlackRock will not earn(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) any other fees or income , including(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) from securities lending , in connection with the purchase of bond - backed E.T.F.s . ”
Dennis Kelleher , chief executive of Better Markets , a nonprofit group that supports(#overlap 2020-03-27 21:48:24) stringent financial regulation(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) , said(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) it appeared(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) that Jay Powell , the Federal Reserve chairman , was taking(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) steps to show(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) the public and elected leaders the public and elected leaders wanted(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) to earn(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) the public and elected leaders trust .
“ the public and elected leaders learned(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) the lesson from the last time that needless(#Depend-on 2020-03-27 21:48:24) secrecy breeds(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) suspicion(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) and destroys(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) credibility , ” Jay Powell , the Federal Reserve chairman , said(#before 2020-03-27 21:48:24) .
