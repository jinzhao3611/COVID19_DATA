If undiagnosed people had n't spread(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) the virus , the number of cases could have been reduced(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) by 66 % in Wuhan and 79 % across China , A new study reports(#overlap 2020-03-19 09:25:35) .

A new study found(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) that undocumented cases transmitted(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) undiagnosed COVID-19 coronavirus about half as often as documented(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) cases .

A new study concluded(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) that if the virus had n't spread , the cases could have been reduced(#before 2020-03-19 09:25:35) by 66 % in Wuhan and 79 % across China .
