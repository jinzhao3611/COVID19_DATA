Barbara Corcoran: Educated(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) homebuyers can get(#included right) the ‘deal of a lifetime’ right now .
2020-04-16 21:57:59 +00:00 .
Is now a good time to buy(#included right) a home ?
It might be — but not for the reasons you would think(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) .
When the novel coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) subsides(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) , home prices could be higher , and financing could be harder to come(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) by , so buyers should try(#included right) to find(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) deals now , said(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) Barbara Corcoran , Shark Tank judge and founder of the Corcoran Group , a New York - based residential brokerage .
“ If you ’re smart enough to attack(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) the market as an educated consumer , and get(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) out there , and make(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) a bid on a sweetheart deal , you ’re gon na be the smartest guy .
And everybody ’s going(#included right) to applaud(#included right) you six months from now , ” Barbara Corcoran , Shark Tank judge and founder of the Corcoran Group , a New York - based residential brokerage said(#included Wednesday) on YFi PM Wednesday .
the market could soon favor(#after 2020-04-16 21:57:59) sellers even more than the market did previously , since sellers have pulled(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) sellers homes off the market , limiting(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) inventory and driving(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) up prices .
On top of that , buyers will have(#after 2020-04-16 21:57:59) more competition once consumers start(#included right) buying(#included right) again .
“ The reality is [ that ] when they [ buyers ] come(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) to the market , everyone ’s going(#after 2020-04-16 21:57:59) to be in the market at the same time , everyone ’s gon na pay(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) more for the home then than everyone ’s going(#included now) to pay(#included now) now , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) Barbara Corcoran , Shark Tank judge and founder of the Corcoran Group , a New York - based residential brokerage .
Plus , banks are tightening(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) lending standards which could make(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) home buying(#overlap 2020-04-16 21:57:59) harder when activity resumes(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) .
JPMorgan Chase , the country 's largest lender by assets , announced(#included Wednesday) April 11 that JPMorgan Chase , the country 's largest lender by assets , has raised(#included Wednesday) home loan borrowing standards .
Borrowers now need(#included now) a 700 credit rating and a down payment equal to 20 % of the home ’s value .
“ Low mortgage rates are great if you can get(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) Low mortgage rates .
Lenders are tightening(#overlap 2020-04-16 21:57:59) requirements .
It ’s going(#after 2020-04-16 21:57:59) to take(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) some time for banks to get(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) comfortable lending again , ” said(#included 2020-04-02) Danielle Hale , chief economist at Realtor.com , on The First Trade on Thursday .
Standards could get(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) even tighter , said(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) Barbara Corcoran , Shark Tank judge and founder of the Corcoran Group , a New York - based residential brokerage .
“ Once the market resumes(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) , a lot of people are going(#after 2020-04-16 21:57:59) to be knocked(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) out of the lending environment , [ and ] not be able to get(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) the financing for the homes … , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) Barbara Corcoran , Shark Tank judge and founder of the Corcoran Group , a New York - based residential brokerage .
“ And in making(#overlap 2020-04-16 21:57:59) the requirements more stringent , making ’s not good(#before 2020-04-16 21:57:59) for the consumer .
making ’s especially hurtful(#overlap 2020-04-16 21:57:59) to the first - time homebuyer . ”
