Adding(#before 2020-04-20 02:49:57) to worries(#overlap 2020-04-20 02:49:57) the global economy is sliding(#overlap 2020-04-20 02:49:57) into recession(#before 2020-04-20 02:49:57) , Ministry of Finance data showed(#included May 22 , 2019) Japanese exports fell(#included May 22 , 2019) 11.7 % in the year to March , compared(#included February) with a 10.1 % decrease(#included February) expected(#before 2020-04-20 02:49:57) by economists in a Reuters poll .

“ The impact is likely to continue(#included February) in March and onwards , which will prevent(#after 2020-04-20 02:49:57) economic activity from normalizing(#after 2020-04-20 02:49:57) , ” said(#before 2020-04-20 02:49:57) Takeshi Minami , chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute .
