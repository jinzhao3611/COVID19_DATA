By Orathai Sriring BANGKOK , March 20 ( Reuters ) - Thailand ’s central bank cut(#included 2020-04-03) its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a record low of 0.75 % on Friday as the spread of coronavirus exerted(#included 2020-04-03) further pressure on the flagging economy .
The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) , in a special meeting(#included this year) , voted(#included this year) unanimously to lower(#included this year) its key interest rate in a back - to - back cut(#included this year) this year .
cut was the fourth since August .
Friday ’s special meeting(#included 2020-04-03) was the first time(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) since 2003 .
“ cut will mitigate(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) the impact(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) on the flagging economy and also reinforce(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) fiscal measures(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) already implemented(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) and forthcoming , ” The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) said(#included 2020-04-03) in a statement(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) .
That will also reduce(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) the burden of interest on borrowers affected(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) by coronavirus and alleviate(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) strains on liquidity in the financial markets , The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) said(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) .
“ The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) viewed(#included 2020-04-03) that coronavirus would be more severe than previously expected(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) and the situation would take(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) some time before returning(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) to normal .
This would severely affect(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) the flagging economy , ” The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) added(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) .
coronavirus has roiled(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) global financial markets , affecting(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) liquidity and the functioning of Thai financial markets despite the overall stability of the financial system , The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) said(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) .
cut suggests(#overlap 2020-03-20 17:30:23) The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) is accepting that the flagging economy is entering(#overlap 2020-03-20 17:30:23) a recession(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) along with the flagging economy , said(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) Amonthep Chawla , an economist at CIMB Thai .
Central banks around the world have slashed(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) interest rates in the past few weeks and provided(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) additional stimulus in some cases to try(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) to help(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) alleviate(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) the threat to the flagging economy from coronavirus .
Thailand on Friday reported(#included 2020-04-03) 50 new coronavirus infections , taking(#included 2020-04-03) Thailand tally to 322 .
One person has died(#included 2020-04-03) .
“ We now see(#included now) two further policy rate cuts(#included now) of 25 bps each in Q2 and Q3 , taking(#included March 25) its key interest rate to a record - low 0.25 % at end-2020 , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) Tim Leelahaphan , an economist at Standard Chartered .
“ Policy space is running(#overlap 2020-03-20 17:30:23) out , and alternatives have not been communicated(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) , ” Tim Leelahaphan , an economist at Standard Chartered said(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) .
The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) will still meet(#included this year) to review(#included March 25) policy on March 25 , as scheduled(#included this year) , when The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) will also offer(#included this year) updated(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) economic forecasts(#included March 25) .
The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) is expected(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) to slash(#after 2020-03-20 17:30:23) The Bank of Thailand ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) 2020 growth(#included 2020) forecast from 2.8 % .
Some economists predict(#included this year) negative growth(#included this year) for Thailand this year .
Thailand is considered(#overlap 2020-03-20 17:30:23) one of the economies most vulnerable to the virus in Southeast Asia due to Thailand heavy reliance(#overlap 2020-03-20 17:30:23) on Chinese tourists and China trade .
Foreign receipts accounted(#included 2019) for about 11 % of Thailand ’s gross domestic product ( GDP ) last year .
Tourist numbers may fall(#included this year) by 25 % this year as a result of coronavirus , the Tourism Authority of Thailand said(#before 2020-03-20 17:30:23) .
