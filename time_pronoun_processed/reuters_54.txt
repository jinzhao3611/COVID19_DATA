BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A team of Chinese scientists has isolated(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) several antibodies that A team of Chinese scientists says(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) are “ extremely effective ” at blocking(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) the ability of the new coronavirus to enter(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) cells , which eventually could be helpful in treating(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) or preventing(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) COVID-19 .

There is currently no proven(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) effective treatment for the disease , which originated in China and is spreading across the world in a pandemic that has infected more than 850,000 and killed 42,000 .
Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing said(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) a drug made(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) with antibodies like the ones A team of Chinese scientists have found(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) could be used(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) more effectively than the current approaches , including(#included currently) what Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing called(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) “ borderline ” treatment(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) such as plasma .
Plasma contains(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) antibodies but is restricted(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) by blood type .
In early January , Zhang ’s team and a group at the 3rd People ’s Hospital in Shenzhen began(#included early January) analysing(#included early January) antibodies from blood taken(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) from recovered(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) COVID-19 patients , isolating(#included early January) 206 monoclonal antibodies which showed(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) what Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing described(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) as a “ strong ” ability to bind(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) with the virus ’ proteins .
Zhang ’s team and a group at the 3rd People ’s Hospital in Shenzhen then conducted(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) another test(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) to see(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) if Zhang ’s team and a group at the 3rd People ’s Hospital in Shenzhen could actually prevent(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) the disease , which originated in China and is spreading across the world in a pandemic that has infected more than 850,000 and killed 42,000 from entering(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) cells , Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing told(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) Reuters in an interview(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) .
Among the first 20 or so antibodies tested , four were able to block(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) viral entry(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) and of the first 20 or so antibodies tested , two were “ exceedingly good ” at doing so , Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing said(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) .
A team of Chinese scientists is now focused(#included PRESENT_REF) on identifying(#included currently) the most powerful antibodies and possibly combining(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) the most powerful antibodies to mitigate(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) the risk of the new coronavirus mutating(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) .
If all goes(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) well , interested developers could mass(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) produce(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) the most powerful antibodies for testing(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) , first on animals and eventually on humans .
A team of Chinese scientists has partnered(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) with a Sino - U.S. biotech firm , Brii Biosciences , in an effort “ to advance(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) multiple candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic intervention(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) ” , according to a statement(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) by a Sino - U.S. biotech firm , Brii Biosciences , .
“ The importance of antibodies has been proven(#included currently) in the world of medicine for decades now , ” Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing said(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) .
“ antibodies can be used(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) to treat(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) cancer , autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases . ”
The antibodies are not a vaccine but could potentially be given(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) to at - risk people with the aim of preventing(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) The antibodies from contracting(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) COVID-19 .
Normally it takes(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) around two years for a drug even to get(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) close to approval for use on patients , but a pandemic that has infected more than 850,000 and killed 42,000 means things are moving(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) faster , Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing said(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) , with steps that would previously be taken(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) sequentially now being done in parallel .
Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing , hopes(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) The antibodies can be tested(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) on humans in six months .
If The antibodies are found(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) to be effective in trials(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) , actual use for treatment(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) would take(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) longer .
Other experts urge(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:12:35) caution .
“ There ’s a number of steps which will now need(#included PRESENT_REF) to be followed(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) before it could be used(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) as a treatment(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) for coronavirus patients , ” Hong Kong University infectious disease specialist Ben Cowling said(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) when the finding was described(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) to Hong Kong University infectious disease specialist Ben Cowling by Reuters .
“ But it ’s really exciting to find(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) these potential treatments , and then have(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) a chance to test(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) these potential treatments out .
Because if we can find(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) more candidates , then eventually we ’ll have(#after 2020-04-01 09:12:35) better treatment , ” Hong Kong University infectious disease specialist Ben Cowling said(#before 2020-04-01 09:12:35) .
