Evergrande’s Emerald Bay project flops(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) for the second time in two months as buyers stay(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) away amid Hong Kong’s economic slump .
2020-04-18 13:12:05 +00:00 .
China Evergrande suffered(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) China Evergrande second sales(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) flop in two months as Hong Kong ’s homebuyers gave(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) Hong Kong ’s homebuyers collective cold shoulder to China Evergrande Emerald Bay flats in Tuen Mun , even after a 14 - per cent average discount .
China Evergrande managed(#included 8 pm) to find(#included today) buyers for 18 flats , or a mere 6.7 per cent of the 269 units on offer at 8 pm , according to sales agents .
A month earlier , China Evergrande sold(#included A month earlier) a third of the first batch of Emerald Bay flats during the peak of the city ’s coronavirus outbreak .
Since then , Hong Kong ’s daily confirmed(#included today) cases have fallen(#included today) to single digits for six consecutive days , with two new infections today , bringing(#included today) Hong Kong ’s total caseload to 1,023 , with four lives lost(#included today) .
Still , that was not enough(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) to attract(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) buyers , in an economy mired in its first recession in decades .
Unemployment is expected(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) to rise(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) in Hong Kong , as the services , hospitality and retail industries bear(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) the brunt of more than two months of stay - at - home lockdowns(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) , as city authorities try(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) to contain(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) the city ’s coronavirus outbreak .
try underscores(#included today) the correction(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) that is underway(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) in the world ’s most expensive residential property market , a slump that still has(#overlap 2020-04-18 13:12:05) some way to go(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) , even after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority slashed(#included March 4) the Hong Kong Monetary Authority base lending rate by 50 points on March 4 in lockstep(#included 8 pm) with an emergency cut in the cost of money by the US Federal Reserve .
Property investors , currently spoilt for choice amid plunging prices and expectations of more projects in the pipeline , will take(#after 2020-04-18 13:12:05) Property investors , currently spoilt for choice amid plunging prices and expectations of more projects in the pipeline , time to return(#after 2020-04-18 13:12:05) to the world ’s most expensive residential property market , said(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) Sammy Po Siu - ming , chief executive of the residential division at Midland Realty .
“ Buying confidence will gradually return(#after 2020-04-18 13:12:05) once buyers see(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) that the city ’s coronavirus outbreak is under control , ” Sammy Po Siu - ming , chief executive of the residential division at Midland Realty said(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) .
Phase Two of Emerald Bay , with sizes measuring(#included today) 223 to 314 square feet ( 29 square metres ) , were offered(#included August 2021) at between HK$3.53 million and HK$5.67 million ( US$ 731,500 ) , or HK$16,700 per sq ft on average after China Evergrande kept(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) the discount unchanged at 14 per cent .
China Evergrande made(#included today) payments easier during today ’s sales(#included today) launch(#included today) , requiring(#included today) buyers to put(#included today) down 5 per cent of the property ’s price as an initial deposit , with the remainder payable(#included August 2021) only when buyers get(#included August 2021) buyers keys to the completed(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) flats , scheduled(#included August 2021) for completion(#included August 2021) in August 2021 .
The current sales(#included currently) slump is in stark contrast(#included currently) to the sell - out success in October , when China Evergrande launched(#included today) its first real estate project in Hong Kong with a flying start , selling(#included today) all 167 apartments on offer in a day , out of 1,982 units including(#included today) 22 villas for its first real estate project in Hong Kong .
Buyers were then drawn(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) by the starting price of HK$3.18 million for a 223 sq ft flat after discounts(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) , or HK$14,260 per sq ft , with China Evergrande throwing(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) in sweeteners , such as flexible financing(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) plans , stamp duty discounts(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) and furnishing(#before 2020-04-18 13:12:05) .
