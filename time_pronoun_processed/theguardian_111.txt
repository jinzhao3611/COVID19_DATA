Czech Republic lifts(#overlap 2020-05-25 13:56:01) face mask rule as coronavirus restrictions(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) ease(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) .
2020-05-25 13:56:01 +00:00 .
Czech Republic has lifted(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public , a symbolic landmark in Czech Republic ’s relatively successful battle(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) against Covid-19 .
The long - awaited lifting(#included March) of the regulation(#included March) – imposed(#included March) in March shortly after a state of emergency was declared(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) – coincided(#included March) with the final phase of an easing of lockdown(#included March) restrictions(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) , in which pubs , restaurants , hotels and museums have been fully reopening(#included last week) pubs , restaurants , hotels and museums doors .
Czech officials have pressed(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) ahead with a phased easing of restrictions(#overlap 2020-05-25 13:56:01) amid a consistent decline(#overlap 2020-05-25 13:56:01) in the number of confirmed(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) cases .
The health minister , Adam Vojtěch , declared(#included last week) last week that “ the Covid-19 crisis(#included last week) is behind us ” .
Health ministry figures reported(#included 24 May) 8,932 confirmed(#included 24 May) cases as of 24 May , with nearly 400,000 tests performed(#included 24 May) .
There have been 315 deaths(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) .
Czech Republic was among the first countries in Europe to close(#included 12 March) Czech Republic borders against the spread of coronavirus , on 12 March , ordering(#included 12 March) the closure of most businesses days later .
But the mask edict – in common with neighbouring(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Slovakia – quickly became(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) the symbol of the Czech fight(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) against the pandemic , prompting(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) debate(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) in other countries over whether other countries should follow(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) suit .
its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public was imposed(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) by prime minister Andrej Babiš ’ government after Prague city council initially introduced(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public for travelling(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) on the capital ’s public transport network .
its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public was quickly embraced(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) by the public despite Czech Republic coming(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) under fire for failing(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to provide(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) emergency facewear .
People were encouraged(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to make(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) their own masks at home , while students at fashion schools worked(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to provide(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) their own masks on a voluntary basis .
The psychological effect was clear on Monday , as many people continued(#included Monday) to wear(#included Monday) masks outdoors despite the ending(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) of the regulation(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) .
Some said(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Some did not know(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) why Some continued(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to wear(#included last week) masks despite wear no longer being required(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) .
“ I was in some institutions this morning that do n’t allow(#included last week) people in without masks , but I have just become(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) used to its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public , ” said(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Natasha Manakoski , a 35 - year - old architect walking(#included Monday) through a square in Prague ’s fashionable Vinohrady neighbourhood wearing(#included Monday) a black mask , in common with many other pedestrians .
“ Maybe I feel(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) a little bit safer with a black mask , although it feels(#overlap 2020-05-25 13:56:01) better without a black mask . ”
Masks are still mandatory on public transport and in indoor facilities where people can not guarantee(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) standing(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) a minimum of 2 metres apart .
Pub and restaurant - goers are also expected(#overlap 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to keep(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) wearing(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) masks when not eating(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) or drinking(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) .
In reality , its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public has become(#included lately) inconsistently observed(#included lately) lately .
The limited reopening of bars and cafes to provide(#included 11 May) pavement service on 11 May created(#included 11 May) the anomalous situation of pedestrians wearing masks passing by busy table areas populated by drinkers not wearing them .
Parents accompanying their children to parks have increasingly neglected(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to cover(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Parents accompanying their children to parks faces .
Monday ’s easing(#included Monday) also meant(#included Monday) the reopening(#included Monday) of previously busy tourist attractions such as Prague Castle , which plans(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to admit(#after 2020-05-25 13:56:01) visitors free of charge and without the standard security checks for a limited period , as officials seek(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) to replace(#after 2020-05-25 13:56:01) the disappearance(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) of foreign tourists with more Czechs .
With plans for foreign holidays in disarray(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) , Czech Republic has also said(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Czech Republic would allow(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Czech citizens to visit(#included next month) neighbouring Austria and Slovakia from next month .
Officials have said(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) Czechs should limit(#before 2020-05-25 13:56:01) any foreign holiday plans to countries with similar epidemiological trends to Czech Republic .
