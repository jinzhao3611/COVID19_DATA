The technology giant ’s new iPhone costs(#included 2017) $ 399 , several hundred dollars cheaper than the flagship iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro lines .
To get(#before 2020-04-15 17:59:22) to the lower cost , Apple is using(#overlap 2020-04-15 17:59:22) an iPhone 8 design that debuted(#included 2017) in 2017 along with a less advanced camera system , a smaller and older display and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner instead of 3 - D facial recognition .
