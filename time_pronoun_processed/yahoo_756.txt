Saudi Oil Keeps Flooding(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) Market With Output Pact Yet to Begin .
2020-04-14 23:23:22 +00:00 .
( Bloomberg ) -- Saudi Arabia and other Gulf suppliers may have agreed(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) to cut(#included next month) oil production again starting(#included next month) next month , but by all indications the taps are set(#included April) to remain(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) wide open until then -- swelling(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) stockpiles for at least a few more weeks .
Saudi Arabia ’s crude exports so far in April stand(#included April) at 9.3 million barrels a day , according to tanker - tracking data compiled(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) by Bloomberg .
9.3 million barrels a day compares(#included the coming days) with 6.8 million barrels a day through the first two weeks of March .
What ’s more , there are at least 10 supertankers with the capacity to haul(#after 2020-04-14 23:23:22) a combined 20 million barrels of oil waiting(#included April) to load(#included the coming days) at the Saudi port of Ras Tanura in the coming days .
State - owned oil company Saudi Aramco pledged(#included April) to boost(#included the coming days) output to 12.3 million barrels a day in April as State - owned oil company Saudi Aramco slashed(#included April) prices in a battle(#included April) for market share , following(#included April) the collapse(#included April) of the three - year old OPEC+ pact in March .
As the coronavirus spread across the globe , governments imposed(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) restrictions(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) on movement and demand declined(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) further , as did prices .
Following(#included the coming days) marathon international talks this past weekend , there ’s now a new global deal to limit(#included next month) output , with Saudi Arabia agreeing(#included the coming days) to trim(#included next month) production to 8.5 million barrels a day in May and June .
There ’s been no indication(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) that any producer will close(#included next month) the taps before May , meaning(#included April) millions of barrels a day of crude entering(#included next month) the market that are n’t needed(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) .
“ The arrangement(#included the coming days) is from May , ” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman , the Saudi oil minister , told(#included April) reporters on a conference(#included April) call(#included April) on Monday in reference to the three - year old OPEC+ pact .
“ April was sold(#included the coming days) . ”
In other words , the price war(#included next month) is still on for now .
So far , the market has n’t been impressed(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) .
Global benchmark Brent crude fell(#included March) by as much as 6 % in London on Tuesday .
Deep Discounts
Another measure -- the official selling(#included April) prices that traders pay(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) for actual barrels of crude in the physical market -- indicates(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) that Saudi Arabia is still looking(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) to gain(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) market share .
The so - called OSPs for April were already at The so - called OSPs for April lowest in at least three decades .
Saudi Arabia released(#included this past weekend) May ’s prices earlier this week , deepening(#included this past weekend) the discounts(#included this past weekend) to most markets , especially Asia , where the cut(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) was greater than expected(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) .
Traders are awaiting(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) similar figures from other Gulf producers like the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait , which generally follow(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) the Saudi lead on pricing and production(#included Tuesday) .
Traders also have(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) little incentive to cut(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) output sooner than required(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) .
U.A.E. Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) on U.A.E. Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei Twitter account after marathon international talks that Saudi Arabia “ is committed(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) to reducing(#after 2020-04-14 23:23:22) production(#included PRESENT_REF) from its current production level of 4.1 m ” barrels a day .
That ’s at least 1 million barrels a day higher than That ’s pumped(#included next month) in March , according to Bloomberg estimates(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) .
All of that oil has to go somewhere , and with demand decimated(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) , there ’s only one obvious destination -- storage .
With cargo nominations(#included next month) already set(#included next month) for this month , Saudi Arabia is n’t likely to reduce(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) shipments to Saudi Arabia customers .
But Saudi Arabia could trim(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) volumes Saudi Arabia ’s sending(#overlap 2020-04-14 23:23:22) to storage tanks in Egypt , Rotterdam and Japan .
Without any reduction(#before 2020-04-14 23:23:22) in those flows , though , stockpiles(#included March) will continue(#included next month) to build(#included next month) through the remainder of April .
