Unemployment caused(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) by coronavirus will leave(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) deep scars in US .
2020-03-26 15:33:36 +00:00 .
The surge(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) in unemployment in US caused(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) by the Covid-19 pandemic shatters(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) all previous records .
In its time , its has seen(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) some savage shake - outs of its labour market but nothing that remotely compares(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) to what has just happened(#included 21 March) .
Jobless claims in the week ending 21 March surged(#included 21 March) to almost 3.3 m , which was double what Wall Street analysts had collectively been expecting(#included October 1982) .
The previous worst total in October 1982 was just one fifth of last week ’s level .
surged , though , was during a recession(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) engineered(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) by the then chairman of the Federal Reserve , Paul Volcker , who used(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) ultra - high interest rates to squeeze(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) inflation out of the economy .
The pain in the early 1980s gradually ratcheted(#included the) up : this time The pain in the early 1980s has arrived(#included 21 March) overnight , with whole sectors of the economy shutting(#included last week) for business last week .
As a result , it was an absolute certainty(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) that jobless claims would smash(#included this week) all known(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) records the week ending 21 March .
In truth , the actual number was probably closer to 4 m because government offices struggled(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) to process(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) the deluge of new claimants .
As Paul Ashworth , a US economist at Capital Economics , noted(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) , the increase(#included 21 March) in California was put(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) at 200,000 , whereas more up - to - date information suggests(#overlap 2020-03-26 15:33:36) that the layoffs in California have hit(#included over) the 1 m mark .
Further big weekly rises in jobless claims can be expected(#included over) over the coming(#included over) weeks – although Further big weekly rises in jobless claims seem(#overlap 2020-03-26 15:33:36) unlikely to be quite as big .
That ’s because whole sectors of the economy are also the sectors that employ(#overlap 2020-03-26 15:33:36) Americans in Americans tens of millions .
Before the Covid-19 pandemic struck(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) , US had(#after the late 1960s) US lowest unemployment rate since the late 1960s .
That is now history(#included over) .
The official jobless rate is about to rocket(#included over) from just under 4 % to at least 10 % .
Unemployment will start(#after 2020-03-26 15:33:36) to come(#after 2020-03-26 15:33:36) down again once the economy is out of lockdown(#included over) and starts(#after 2020-03-26 15:33:36) to recover(#after 2020-03-26 15:33:36) .
But The official jobless rate will come(#included over) down less rapidly than The official jobless rate is going(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) up and – on past form – The official jobless rate will leave(#after 2020-03-26 15:33:36) deep scars .
Rising(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) unemployment is not helpful(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) to sitting(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) US presidents seeking(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) re - election , which perhaps explains(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) why the US government ’s stimulus package contained(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) more generous benefits for those losing(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) those jobs .
And why Donald Trump is so keen to get(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) the economy going(#before 2020-03-26 15:33:36) again .
