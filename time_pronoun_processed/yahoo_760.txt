A senior World Health Organisation ( WHO ) figure has said(#before 2020-04-14 07:21:39) that facial protection is going(#after 2020-04-14 07:21:39) to become(#before 2020-04-14 07:21:39) the norm in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak .
Dr David Nabarro , the WHO ’s Covid-19 envoy , said(#before 2020-04-14 07:21:39) that people would need(#after 2020-04-14 07:21:39) to become(#before 2020-04-14 07:21:39) accustomed to a “ new reality ” .

“ The UK Government have(#included current) a review ongoing at the moment on the evidence around masks .
