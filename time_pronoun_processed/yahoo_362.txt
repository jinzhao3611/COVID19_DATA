North Korea has quarantined(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) 380 foreigners , most of whom are diplomats while " while intensifying(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) isolation , medical monitoring(#included February 22 , 2020) and testing(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) measures(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) on those who have returned(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) from overseas travel(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) , those who have contacted(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) 380 foreigners , most of whom are diplomats , and those showing(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) abnormal symptoms , " according to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency , which cited(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) North Korean state media .
North Korea is one of the most isolated(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:49:35) , secretive countries in the world — and the spread of a new coronavirus has only served(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) to exacerbate(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) a new coronavirus isolation .
In an effort to stave(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) off a new coronavirus , North Korea has blocked(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) foreign tourists — most of whom come from China — from entry(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) , the Washington Post reported(#included late January) in late January .

If quarantined appears somewhat perplexing(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:49:35) , it 's because North Korea has not reported(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) a single case of a new coronavirus .

If North Korea is , in fact , battling(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:49:35) an outbreak(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) , North Korea and North Korea neighbors could be in trouble , since sanctions on the country have limited access to proper medical resources .

It will be dangerous for them .
an outbreak could go(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) everywhere . "
" them can not produce(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) the medicine them need(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) because of sanctions on the country , " Nagi Shafik , a former WHO and UNICEF official in Pyongyang continued(#included February 19) .
" Nothing new has come(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) to North Korea to updates(#before 2020-02-24 16:49:35) them medicine or technology .
What even is the best doctor without equipment ? "
