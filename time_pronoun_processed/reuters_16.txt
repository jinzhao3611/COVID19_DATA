By Stine Jacobsen and Nikolaj Skydsgaard COPENHAGEN , April 3 ( Reuters ) - Denmark is expected(#included 2020-W14-WE) this weekend to reveal(#included 2020-W14-WE) plans to relax(#included PRESENT_REF) its coronavirus lockdown , becoming(#included PRESENT_REF) the first country outside Asia to do so , reasoning(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) that the risks of a deep recession(#included PRESENT_REF) may now be more dangerous for Danish society than a second outbreak .
Denmark was one of the first in Europe to shut(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) down , and with the number of coronavirus cases stabilizing(#included PRESENT_REF) Denmark is now facing(#included PRESENT_REF) tough decisions on reopening(#included PRESENT_REF) that many other governments around the world have lying(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) ahead of coronavirus cases .
The Danish government on March 11 ordered(#included 2020-03-11) the closure of schools , day cares , restaurants , cafes and gyms , and shut(#included 2020-03-11) all borders to most foreigners .
On Monday , The Danish government said(#included 2020-03-30) The Danish government would start(#included 2020-W14) gradually lifting(#included PRESENT_REF) its coronavirus lockdown if the numbers of cases and deaths(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) remained(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) stable , apparently confident The Danish government can guard(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) its population against a second outbreak(#after 2020-04-03 16:11:24) .
Frederiksen said(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) Frederiksen hoped(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) to be able to present(#after 2020-04-03 16:11:24) a plan for the first phase of a reopening(#included 2020-W14) by the end of this weekend after consultation(#included 2020-W14) with the other parties in government .
But many Danes question(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) whether The Danish government ’s confidence(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) is well - founded .
Qasim Khan , co - owner and head chef at a small Latin American restaurant in central Copenhagen , applauds(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) the government ’s quick decision(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) to shut(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) down Denmark , but worries(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) that a reopening after Easter would be too early and could actually delay(#after 2020-04-03 16:11:24) a return(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) to normal .
“ You risk(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) that our three weeks of very tough quarantine ends being worth nothing ...
Qasim Khan , co - owner and head chef at a small Latin American restaurant in central Copenhagen , do n’t see(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) a reason for opening(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) up and then risk having to shut(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) down again , ” Qasim Khan , co - owner and head chef at a small Latin American restaurant in central Copenhagen , told(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) Reuters .
In considering(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) whether to ease(#after 2020-04-03 16:11:24) the restrictions(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) , The Danish government is trying(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) to balance(#after 2020-04-03 16:11:24) the need to keep(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) its population safe and the economic risks of a deep recession(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) .
“ POLITICAL CHOICE ”
“ The situation our are in is far more complicated(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) than appreciating(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) human life , ” the country ’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen said(#included 2020-03-30) on Monday .
“ We can not open(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) a textbook - neither on healthcare nor economy - and find(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) the right answer , ” the country ’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen said(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) , adding(#included 2020-03-30) : “ The math is too simple . ”
Denmark had reported(#included 2020-W14) 139 coronavirus - related deaths(#included 2020-04-03) as of Friday , with the number of patients hospitalized(#included 2020-W14) falling(#included 2020-W14) this weekend .
“ What the country ’s done so far is very sensible , but I would have liked(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) to see(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) a development over a longer period before I dared(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) to say(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) that the curve is broken(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) I .
Frederiksen acknowledged(#included 2020-03-30) on Monday that “ the strategy the University of Southern Denmark follow(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) is a political choice . ”
Restaurant owner Khan , with the help of Restaurant owner Khan pregnant girlfriend and two remaining staff , is still keeping(#overlap 2020-04-03 16:11:24) Restaurant owner Khan kitchen open for take - away orders(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) .
“ Is it really worth risking(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) getting(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) ill versus shutting(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) down the place ?
risking has been the toughest decision(#included 2020-03-30) , ” Restaurant owner Khan said(#before 2020-04-03 16:11:24) .
