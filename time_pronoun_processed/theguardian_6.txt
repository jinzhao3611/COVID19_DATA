2020-04-03 20:09:52 +00:00 .
Trump administration decided(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) to end(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China .
The project , called(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) Predict , had been run(#after 2009) by the US Agency for International Development since 2009 .
Trump administration had identified(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) more than 160 different coronaviruses that had(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the potential to develop(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) into pandemics , including(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a virus that is considered(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the closest known relative to Covid-19 .
A decision to wind(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) down a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China was made(#included 2020-09) , however , in September , just three months before the first reports(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) of people becoming(#included 2020-09) infected(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) with Covid-19 in Wuhan , China .
The end of a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China saw(#included 2020-09) the departure(#included 2020-09) of dozens of scientists and analysts working(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) to identify(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:09:52) potential pandemics(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) in countries around the world , including(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) China .
“ a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China was a genius , visionary program that USAid took(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a big risk to fund(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) and it ’s a crying shame a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China was canceled(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) Peter Daszak , president of EcoHealth Alliance , a non - profit specialist in tackling wildlife - borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program .
Peter Daszak , president of EcoHealth Alliance , a non - profit specialist in tackling wildlife - borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program said(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) Peter Daszak , president of EcoHealth Alliance , a non - profit specialist in tackling wildlife - borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program did not know(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) why a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China was scrapped(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) or if the White House played(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) any direct role in a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China ending(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) .
EcoHealth Alliance , a non - profit specialist in tackling wildlife - borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program has been given(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a temporary extension to work(#after 2020-04-03 20:09:52) on a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China but the role will finally come(#included 2020-09) to a close(#included 2020-09) in September .
The news about Predict ’s demise(#included 2020-09) was first reported(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) in the Los Angeles Times .
Predict ’s work(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) focused(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) on the dangers of viruses spreading(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) from wildlife to humans and causing(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) possible pandemics(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) like the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt .
It is suspected(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) that Covid-19 made(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the leap to humans from a bat sold(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) at a Wuhan , China market .
Peter Daszak , president of EcoHealth Alliance , a non - profit specialist in tackling wildlife - borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program said(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) there are an estimated(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) 1.7 m mystery coronaviruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic , making(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the early detection of wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic imperative for public health and economic reasons .
“ We should ’ve been more unsettled about this before this happened(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) , ” Peter Daszak , president of EcoHealth Alliance , a non - profit specialist in tackling wildlife - borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program said(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) .
“ We got(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a lot of flak for spending(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) money in other countries but just think(#overlap 2020-04-03 20:09:52) how much even a few billion would be worth to stop(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) this sort of pandemic(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) .
It ’s sad to see(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China finish(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) because a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China ’s the way of the future , in 50 years they will be bog - standard .
“ I ’m not confident we will learn(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the lessons from a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China , though .
we saw(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the same thing happen(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) after Ebola and then Zika .
We are always behind with pandemics(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) , We are flying(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) blind .
We have hit(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the snooze button several times and now here ’s the big one . ”
It ’s not clear whether a continuation of a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China would have dampened(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the current pandemic(#included PRESENT_REF) , although Trump administration has faced(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) criticism(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) for Trump administration preparation(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) before the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt .
Trump administration reduced(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) a team working(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) in China on pandemics(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) and has repeatedly attempted(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) to cut(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
A spokesman for USAid told(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the Los Angeles Times that a $ 200 m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China was “ just one component of USAid ’s global health security efforts and accounted(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) for less than 20 % of USAid global health security funding ” .
A new initiative(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) to help(#before 2020-04-03 20:09:52) prevent(#after 2020-04-03 20:09:52) the spread of diseases from animals to humans is due(#included later this year) to start(#included later this year) later this year .
