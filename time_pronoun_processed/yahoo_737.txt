( Bloomberg ) --
Argentina presented(#included Thursday) the broad outlines of a long - awaited restructuring offer to foreign bondholders as Argentina seeks(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) to put(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) Argentina finances on a sustainable path .
Investors are being asked(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) to accept(#after 2020-04-16 20:31:55) a three - year moratorium on payments and a 62 % haircut on the interest Investors ’re owed(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) , Economy Minister Martin Guzman told(#included Thursday) reporters Thursday .
Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#included Thursday) that complete details of a three - year moratorium on payments will come(#included tomorrow) tomorrow .
“ a three - year moratorium on payments means a greater cut in interest than in principal , ” Economy Minister Martin Guzman said(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) .
a three - year moratorium on payments is part of the government ’s efforts to shore(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) up the budget and reignite(#after 2020-04-16 20:31:55) growth(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) .
Just a few years after Argentina returned(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) to international capital markets following(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) a decade - long lockout(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) , Argentina is headed(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) toward the ninth default in its 200 - year history .
the ninth default in its 200 - year history comes(#included 2020) with the economy forecast(#included 2020) to shrink(#included 2020) for a third straight year in 2020 and the currency down by more than half over the past 24 months .
Bondholders had been bracing(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) for pain , with Argentina ’s dollar - denominated notes recently trading(#included recently) at about 30 cents on the dollar .
Prices collapsed(#included August last year) in August last year when primary elections(#included August last year) signaled(#included August last year) strong support for candidates considered(#included August last year) to be less friendly toward business and investors .
Since taking(#included December) office in December , President Alberto Fernandez has already pushed(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) back bond payments(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) for both peso- and dollar - denominated securities governed(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) by local laws .
While President Alberto Fernandez made(#included August last year) pushed unilaterally , backed(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) by a friendly court system , the bonds covered(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) by New York law present a new test .
Economy Ministry officials and bondholders were at odds(#included earlier this month) earlier this month over how long Argentina might go(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) without making(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) debt payments .
Officials from investment firms including(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) Blackrock Inc. , Pacific Investment Management Co. , Ashmore Group Plc , Greylock Capital and Fintech Advisory Inc. have been involved(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) in the talks(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) , held(#included April 13) via video conference(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) .
Robert Koenigsberger , the chief investment officer at Gramercy Funds Management , said(#included April 13) on Bloomberg TV April 13 that a deal could be reached(#included 2020) within a month .
Argentina has(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) $ 3.5 billion in payments(#included 2020) on foreign - law bonds due in the remainder of 2020 , according to Buenos Aires - based consultancy 1816 Economia y Estrategia , including(#included 2020) $ 500 million of interest due(#included December) on April 22 .
President Alberto Fernandez ’s administration has also been in talks(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) with the International Monetary Fund to rework(#included 2020) a record $ 56 billion financing(#included 2020) agreement(#included 2020) signed(#included 2020) in 2018 .
Officials at the International Monetary Fund said(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) before a three - year moratorium on payments was unveiled(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) that a “ meaningful contribution(#after 2020-04-16 20:31:55) ” will be necessary from private bondholders to ensure(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) debt sustainability .
President Alberto Fernandez is looking(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) to reach(#after 2020-04-16 20:31:55) a negotiated(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) settlement(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) with creditors and avoid(#after 2020-04-16 20:31:55) a hard default(#included 2018) that would result(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) in a costly and lengthy legal fight(#after 2020-04-16 20:31:55) .
But Argentina must decide(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) how confrontational Argentina wants(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) to be with the economy in such a precarious place .
Argentina remains(#included 2018) largely under lockdown(#included April 22) through at least April 26 to halt(#included 2018) the spread of coronavirus , and gross domestic product may contract(#included this year) 5.4 % this year because of the pandemic(#before 2020-04-16 20:31:55) , according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast .
Argentina has(#overlap 2020-04-16 20:31:55) a total debt load of more than $ 323 billion , equal to 89 % of GDP , and Argentina foreign reserves have tumbled(#included the past year) more than 40 % over the past year to just $ 43.9 billion .
