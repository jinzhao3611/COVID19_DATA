The Bank of Japan has(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) various tools at The Bank of Japan disposal if The Bank of Japan were to ramp up stimulus(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) such as accelerating(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) money printing , increasing(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) market operation tools and cutting(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) interest rates , Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) in a semi - annual testimony(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) to parliament .
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda signalled(#included Tuesday) that any further steps the BOJ takes(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) will focus(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) on helping(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) cash - strapped firms , rather than stimulating(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) demand .
“ What ’s most important for us is to take(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) steps to smoothen(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) corporate financing(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) and stabilise(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) markets , ” Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) .
“ us will do whatever us can as a central bank , working(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) closely with the government . ”
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda ruled(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) out the possibility of adding(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) municipal bonds to the list of assets the BOJ buys(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) , however , saying(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda saw(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) no need to do so for the time being .
the the economy is on the cusp(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) of a deep recession(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) with many analysts projecting(#included the) a double - digit contraction(#included the) in the current quarter , as the coronavirus pandemic forces households to stay(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) home and businesses to shut(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) down .
While the government plans(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) to lift(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) the state of emergency(#overlap 2020-05-12 04:13:53) for some prefectures that saw(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) infection numbers stabilise(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) , many big cities including(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) Tokyo will likely see(#included the) current restrictions(#included the) kept(#included current) in place at least for the rest of this month .
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) Japan did not face(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) an imminent risk of a sharp credit contraction(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) , as many financial institutions have(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) sufficient buffers to weather(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) the pain from the coronavirus pandemic .
But Governor Haruhiko Kuroda warned(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) the outlook for Japan ’s economy was “ highly uncertain ” and dependent on when the coronavirus pandemic is contained(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) , with risks skewed(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) to the downside .
“ Japan ’s economy is in an increasingly severe state .
the outlook for Japan ’s economy will remain(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) severe for the time being , ” Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) .
BOJ expanded(#included April) monetary stimulus(#included the) for the second straight months in April .
For both months , BOJ focused(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) on steps to ease(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) corporate funding as efforts to prop(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) up demand would run(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) against government requests(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) for households to stay(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) home .
The measures taken so far include(#included both) doubling(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) the pace of annual purchases(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) of exchange - traded funds ( ETF ) , ramping(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) up buying(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) of corporate bonds and commercial paper , and pledging(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) to buy(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) unlimited amounts of government bonds .
The measures taken so far are temporary steps to combat(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) the growing fallout from the coronavirus pandemic , BOJ executive director Shinichi Uchida told(#included Tuesday) parliament on Tuesday , adding(#included Tuesday) The Bank of Japan had(#included PRESENT_REF) no preset idea now on when The measures taken so far will be rolled(#included current) back .
BOJ also plans(#after 2020-05-12 04:13:53) to set(#included the) up as early as this month a new scheme that rewards(#included the) financial institutions that tap(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) government loan schemes(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) to boost(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) lending to small firms .
“ We ’re ready to take(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) sufficient steps judged(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) necessary at the time , ” Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said(#included Tuesday) .
About 15,847 coronavirus infections and 633 deaths(#included April) have been confirmed(#included Monday) in Japan as of Monday , excluding(#included Monday) cases from a cruise ship previously quarantined(#before 2020-05-12 04:13:53) in Yokohama , according to NHK .
