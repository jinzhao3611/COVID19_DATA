Peter Navarro , a top economic adviser to Donald Trump , has criticized(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) Obama after Trump said(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) the country was suffering(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) from a vacuum of leadership on the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) .
“ I ’m glad Obama has(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) a new job as Joe Biden ’s press secretary , ” Peter Navarro , a top economic adviser to Donald Trump , said(#included Saturday) on ABC News ’ This Week .
Joe Biden , Obama ’s former vice president , is running(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) against Trump for president .
In a speech(#included Saturday) billed(#included Saturday) as an address to graduates on Saturday , Obama said(#included Saturday) “ more than anything , this pandemic(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) has fully , finally torn(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) what so many of the folks in charge ’re doing .
A lot of so many of the folks in charge are n’t even pretending(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) to be in charge(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) . ”
Peter Navarro , a top economic adviser to Donald Trump , responded(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) that Obama ’s administration “ was a kumbaya of incompetence ” .
Peter Navarro , a top economic adviser to Donald Trump , falsely accused(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) Trump , as Trump frequently has(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) , of allowing(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) “ millions of manufacturing jobs ” to move(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) to the country .
In fact the main transfer of manufacturing jobs from the United States to China , such as the main transfer of manufacturing jobs from the United States to China was , occurred(#included the early 2000s) in the early 2000s , before Obama was president .
Separately , in repetition(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) of a reckless Trumpian line with no basis in evidence , Peter Navarro , a top economic adviser to Donald Trump , accused(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) the country of deliberately “ seeding(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) ” the world with the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” .
“ The Chinese behind the shield of the World Health Organization – for two months – hid(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” from the world and then sent(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) hundreds of thousands of Chinese on aircraft to Milan , New York and around the world to seed(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) hid , ” Peter Navarro , a top economic adviser to Donald Trump , said(#included Saturday) on ABC News .
“ The Chinese behind the shield of the World Health Organization could have kept(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” in Wuhan .
Instead the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” became(#included the early 2000s) a pandemic(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) . ”
In fact Chinese scientists raised(#included early January) the alarm about Covid-19 in early January and published(#included 11 January) the genomic structure of Sars - CoV-2 online on 11 January so that scientists worldwide could begin(#after 2020-05-17 15:26:05) fighting(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” .
But Obama ’s administration failed(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) to stand(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) up widespread testing(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) for the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” and educate the public about the looming(#included Saturday) threat , with Trump dismissing(#included Saturday) the novel coronavirus , which Navarro calls “ China virus ” as a Democratic hoax(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) .
An uptick in racist attacks(#overlap 2020-05-17 15:26:05) against Asian Americans in the country
has coincided(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) with the Obama ’s administration ’s messaging blaming(#before 2020-05-17 15:26:05) the country for Covid-19 .
