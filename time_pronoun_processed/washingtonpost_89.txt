Opinion | Restoring(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) Virginia’s economic health may take(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) years .
2020-04-22 16:46:57 +00:00 .
Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) in an email that the more than 28,000 jobs Virginians lost in March were “ the largest one - month drop in absolute terms since [ Virginians began(#included 2020-04-22) measuring(#included 2020-04-22) the data in ] 1939 and the largest percentage drop since January 2009 . ”
Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#included March) about half of the largest percentage drop since January 2009 was from the “ leisure and hospitality sector , ” bolstering(#included March) the dire picture from the National Restaurant Association .
But again , that was just part of the bigger , bleaker , picture .
“ Well over 400,000 people have filed(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) for unemployment in Virginia in the last 4 weeks , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
“ For some context , we had(#included 2020-02) a little over 117,000 unemployed in February . ”
“ From the more than 28,000 jobs Virginians lost in March , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , “ it is clear that the shutdowns / stay - at - home orders(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) have affected(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) Virginia businesses . ”
Unsurprisingly , business confidence has dropped(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
But Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) despite the gloom , “ only a small percentage of the firms that we talk(#included currently) to are currently worried(#included currently) about solvency . ”
Businesses ’ bigger worries are “ about cash flow or customer demand , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , adding(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) “ Businesses ’ report(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) that Businesses ’ are not on the brink of permanently closing(#included March) yet . ”
Given(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) all this , Virginia ’s economy is going(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) to take(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) a hit .
But Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , says(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) we ’ll have to wait(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) several weeks before we ’ll know(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) just how deep the damage has been .
“ First quarter Virginia GDP will not be released(#before July 7) until July 7 , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#included March) , “ and First quarter Virginia GDP , as we know(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , will not tell(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) a big part of the story — we will have to wait(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) for second quarter GDP for released . ”
This data is important because This data helps(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) the Northam administration create(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) the revenue projections upon which the state budget rests(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
And we all know(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) the projections used(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) to create(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) the $ 135 billion budget passed(#included March) in March are little more than fiction .
The Richmond Feds ’s Joseph Mengedoth , an associate regional economist who analyzes state and local budgets , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) in an email that rising(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) unemployment , business closures and lower tax receipts all mean(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) big hits to the state budget .
But the blow could be worse for localities , many of which , Joseph Mengedoth , an associate regional economist who analyzes state and local budgets , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , “ levy(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) additional sales and meals taxes on top of the state rate to fund(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) their budgets — schools , in particular . ”
What might Virginia ’s employment(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) market look(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) like in the months ahead ?
Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) that was a difficult question to answer(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
“ This is a health crisis(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , so presumably , the productive capacity of the economy was not affected(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) and when This started(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
Pre - lockdowns , “ we were at a record tight labor market in the U.S. and in Virginia , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
But Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , added(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , “ the longer this goes(#after 2020-04-22 16:46:57) on , the more likely we will affect(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) productive capacity — firms could shutter(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) and the long - term unemployed are much less likely to be re - employed than the short - term unemployed . ”
As for when Virginia ’s economy might get(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) back to something resembling(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) normal , Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) that ’s hard to predict(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) .
But Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , believes(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) “ economic activity will not resume(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) completely normally for a while . ”
“ That matters(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , “ for long - term employment trends , ” because even if Virginia snaps back to Virginia pre - shutdown level of activity , getting(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) the more than 28,000 jobs Virginians lost in March back wo n’t be easy .
“ From July 2007 to February 2010 , ” Sonya Ravindranath Waddell , a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed ’s regional economics group , said(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) , “ the Virginia unemployment rate rose(#before 2018) from 3.0 to 7.5 and it took(#before 2018) until 2018 to get(#before 2018) back to 3.0 percent . ”
The strong desire(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) of Virginians to return(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) to normal is understandable .
But returning(#overlap 2020-04-22 16:46:57) to the way things were before the coronavirus pandemic may take(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) years .
If Virginians comes(#before 2020-04-22 16:46:57) back at all .
