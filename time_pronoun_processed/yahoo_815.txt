Indonesia ’s currency , which has been seen(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) as a proxy for emerging - market sentiment , has faced(#included recent weeks) heavy selling(#included recent weeks) in recent weeks as the deadly pandemic(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) has spread(#included recent weeks) around the world .
rupiah has tumbled(#included this year) more than 15 % the year even though Indonesia has unveiled(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) $ 25 billion of fiscal stimulus , temporarily scrapped(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) a cap on the budget deficit and beefed(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) up the central bank ’s powers to intervene(#overlap 2020-04-07 01:43:04) in the currency and bond markets .
The following charts show(#overlap 2020-04-07 01:43:04) why there may be some light at the end of the tunnel : An index of dollar - rupiah volatility over the next month based(#Depend-on 2020-04-07 01:43:04) on options has jumped(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) above a similar gauge covering(#Depend-on 2020-04-07 01:43:04) the next 12 months .
Under normal circumstances , longer - maturity options have(#included this year) a higher volatility due to the greater uncertainty embedded(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) over a longer time horizon .
This reversal , which took(#included early March) place in early March , indicates(#included early March) traders believe(#included this year) the current heightened volatility will ease(#included recent weeks) through the coming year .

The spread between one - month and 12 - month dollar - rupiah non - deliverable forwards widened(#included early March) to as much as 1,051 basis points in late March as the coronavirus emergency(#included this year) intensified(#included this year) .
widened signals(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) an increase(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) in bearish bets over a 12 - month time horizon .
Nonetheless , The spread between one - month and 12 - month dollar - rupiah non - deliverable forwards is still well below those of previous risk - off episodes .
Following the shock devaluation(#included this year) of the yuan in 2015 , The spread between one - month and 12 - month dollar - rupiah non - deliverable forwards jumped(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) as high as 1,129 , while The spread between one - month and 12 - month dollar - rupiah non - deliverable forwards climbed(#included recent weeks) to 1,724 after the election(#included recent weeks) of U.S. President Donald Trump in November 2016 .

The shockwaves of selling that have reverberated(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) around financial markets have meant(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) many analyst forecasts(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) have been thrown(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) out the window .
The very latest predictions though , should start(#after 2020-04-07 01:43:04) to factor(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) in the impact(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) of the coronavirus .
What ’s notable about this is that the majority predict(#overlap 2020-04-07 01:43:04) rupiah to strengthen(#included the coming year) during the second half of the year .
Bank Julius Baer Co. predicts(#overlap 2020-04-07 01:43:04) rupiah will appreciate(#included the coming year) to 15,840 per dollar by year - end from rupiah level of about 16,400 on Monday .

All this is not to say(#before 2020-04-07 01:43:04) rupiah is out of the woods just yet .
