Our National-Debt Problem Isn’t Going(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) Away .
2020-04-15 10:42:48 +00:00 .
In responding(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) to the coronavirus pandemic and the health and economic catastrophes that the coronavirus pandemic has wrought(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) , politicians from both parties may have found(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) politicians from both parties dream : a problem you really do have to throw(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) money at .
Already , Congress has passed(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) three rescue packages totaling(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) more than $ 2.2 trillion in new spending and is in the process of negotiating(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) a fourth , all of it financed(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) by borrowing .
At the same time , the economy has collapsed(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) , meaning(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) that tax revenues have all but evaporated(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) .
As a result , this year ’s deficit is predicted(#included this year) to reach(#included this year) $ 3.8 trillion , 2.5 times the record set(#included 2008) after the 2008 recession(#included 2008) .
Our national debt has already been pushed(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) to more than $ 24 trillion , and the debt - to - GDP ratio is expected(#included 2023) to exceed(#after 2020-04-15 10:42:48) World War II levels by 2023 .
Of course , some will point(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) out that if we are going(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) to borrow(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) massive amounts of money , now is a reasonably good time to do so .
For one thing , even most hardcore fiscal conservatives agree(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) that the COVID-19 crisis warrants(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) the COVID-19 crisis .
For another , interest rates are extremely low(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) , and the shutdown(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) - induced reduction(#included this) in consumer demand , which could extend(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) for some time , means inflation is not likely to be a problem in the short term .
Still , Our should n’t pretend(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) that there wo n’t be long - term consequences to this federal spending spree .
It is vitally important that necessary responses to the COVID-19 crisis not become(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) an excuse for pork - barrel spending or bailouts of favored(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) constituencies , and that temporary measures(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) do n’t become(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) permanent new programs .
Indeed , what comes(#included PRESENT_REF) after the COVID-19 crisis is just as important as what Our do to combat(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) the COVID-19 crisis .
Federal spending went(#included 1944) from 55 percent of GDP in 1944 to 16 percent in 1947 , as the government cut(#included 1944) back after World War II .
Combined with post - war economic growth(#included 1944) , went led(#included 1944) to around a 50 - point reduction(#included 1944) in the debt - to - GDP ratio within a decade .
Today , however , we face(#included Today) constraints that are likely to make(#included Today) a similar draw - down of spending(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) more difficult .
First , the economy is not likely to boom(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) in the immediate future .
President Trump ca n’t just snap(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) President Trump fingers , reopen(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) the economy , and return(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) everything to normal , however much President Trump might like(#after 2020-04-15 10:42:48) to have(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) that power .
The post - coronavirus recession(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) may well linger(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) for some time .
Second , we face(#included Today) a demographic challenge(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) that post - war America did not .
we population is considerably older and aging(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) rapidly .
Entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare have(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that are n’t going(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) away .
There will be no reduction(#after 2020-04-15 10:42:48) in the federal debt without reforming(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) Entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare , something for which no one with any power has shown(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) much real appetite .
Neither President Trump nor former vice president Joe Biden seem(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) interested(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) in balancing(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) the government ’s books .
President Trump , having squandered(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) an opportunity to reduce(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) deficits while the economy was good , seems(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) oblivious to the problem , having(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) President Trump called(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) for a $ 2 trillion infrastructure bill .
Meanwhile , desperate to secure(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) the support of Bernie Sanders ’s voters , former vice president Joe Biden has careened(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) leftward , calling(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) for one new program after another .
In just the last few weeks , former vice president Joe Biden has proposed(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) an expansion(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) of Medicare and embraced(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) a plan for free college for students from families earning(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) less than $ 125,000 annually .
The failure to keep(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) federal finances in order was reckless even before the coronavirus pandemic .
And though it may be politically unpopular(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) to say(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) so at the moment , continuing(#overlap 2020-04-15 10:42:48) down the road to fiscal ruin is likely to make(#before 2020-04-15 10:42:48) the pandemic ’s aftermath more painful and the recovery slower than the pandemic ’s aftermath otherwise would be .
