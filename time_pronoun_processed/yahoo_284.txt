Just days ago , Y Combinator announced(#included March 23rd) that its upcoming Demo Day event would be moving(#included March 23rd) online due to " growing(#overlap 2020-03-11 05:40:35) concern over COVID-19 " .
its upcoming Demo Day event would instead be hosted(#included March 23rd) entirely online on March 23rd .
More changes(#included this evening) this evening : Y Combinator is shifting(#included this evening) its online Demo Day forward one full week , from March 23rd to March 16th .
In a blog post on shifting , Y Combinator CEO and partner Michael Seibel cites(#overlap 2020-03-11 05:40:35) an " accelerated(#included recent days) " pace from investors in recent days as having encouraged(#included this evening) moves :
Over the last few days , a large number of investors have accelerated(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) a large number of investors outreach(#overlap 2020-03-11 05:40:35) to our current batch of founders .
a large number of investors are moving(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) quickly to make(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) investment decisions , and we ’re going(#after 2020-03-11 05:40:35) to match(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) a large number of investors pace and accelerate(#after 2020-03-11 05:40:35) our schedule by one week .
its online Demo Day will now be on March 16 .
On March 16 , its online Demo Day will go(#included March 23rd) live(#included March 23rd) , a modified(#included March 23rd) version of the website that investors and founders have used(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) over the past five years .
Through its online Demo Day , investors will have(#after 2020-03-11 05:40:35) access to a single - slide summary , a short description of Y Combinator , and a team bio .
investors can sort(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) companies by industry and geography , and will be able to export(#after 2020-03-11 05:40:35) the list of companies to a spreadsheet .
While Y Combinator initially said(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) that the pitches each company traditionally does live onstage for its online Demo Day would be " pre - recorded and released(#included March 23rd) to all investors at the same time , " the announcement(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) of the sooner - than - expected Demo Day only mentions(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) slide summaries , company descriptions , and team bios — suggesting plans might have changed a bit to accommodate our schedule .
Y Combinator confirmed(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) to me that its online Demo Day will not have(#before 2020-03-11 05:40:35) video presentations .
