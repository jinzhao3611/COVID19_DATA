“ India is one of the countries which understood(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) the seriousness of this disease and waged(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) a timely war(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) against this disease .
India took(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) several decisions and tried(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) India best to implement(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) several decisions on ground , ” Coronavirus: Modi said(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) .

On Sunday , Coronavirus: Modi led(#included Sunday) citizens in a national candle - lit vigil , urging(#included Sunday) people to turn(#included Sunday) off people lights for nine minutes at 9 pm .
Those without candles could shine(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) Those without candles mobile phone flashlights in the air , Coronavirus: Modi suggested(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) .
a national candle - lit vigil showed(#included 2020-03-30) “ the strength and togetherness ” of India ’s 1.3 billion population , Coronavirus: Modi said(#included 2020-03-30) on Monday , adding(#included 2020-03-30) that India had “ demonstrated(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) unity and strengthened(#included 2020-03-30) India resolve to fight(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) Covid-19 ” .
National power grid data showed(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) that a remarkable number of people observed(#included Sunday) the nine - minute blackout(#included Sunday) , with India ’s overall power demand plunging(#included Sunday) as much as 26.6 per cent .
The initiative(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) was considerably more popular(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) in northern India , consisting(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) of Coronavirus: Modi ’s Hindi - speaking heartlands , where demand fell(#included Sunday) almost twice as steeply as in southern states .
But even in the south , where opposition has been more fierce towards Coronavirus: Modi ’s Hindu nationalist party , many still backed(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) the call(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) for unity during the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) .

" People wanted(#included 2020-03-30) to show(#included yesterday) solidarity with a national cause yesterday , as we 're all facing(#included yesterday) a tough time amid a lockdown imposed that left millions of migrant workers stranded . ”
India ’s virus death(#included 2020-03-30) toll rose(#included 2020-03-30) above 100 on Monday , while total cases stand(#included yesterday) at more than 4,000 .
The tolls are rising(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) steadily in spite of a lockdown imposed that left millions of migrant workers stranded , partly because India has been much slower than other countries in rolling(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) out testing(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) .
Health ministry officials are now hinting(#included PRESENT_REF) at a localised lockdown(#included past 14 April) continuing(#included past 14 April) past 14 April , with a report(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) in the Indian Express pointing(#included PRESENT_REF) out that more than 80 per cent of cases have appeared(#before 2020-04-07 12:04:42) in clusters in 62 districts .
