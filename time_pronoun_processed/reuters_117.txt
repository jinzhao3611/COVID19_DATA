LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British company behind a 10 - minute coronavirus antibody test , which will cost about a $ 1 , has begun(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) sending(#overlap 2020-03-26 19:56:59) prototypes to laboratories for validation(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) , which could be a game - changer in the fight(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) against the pandemic .

NEXU
Nexu Science Communication / via REUTERS Health technology firm Mologic , which created one of the first at - home pregnancy tests , is aiming(#overlap 2020-03-26 19:56:59) for a 10 - minute coronavirus antibody test , which will cost about a $ 1 to be rolled(#included this week) out by as early as June if the trials(#included early) are successful .
Antibody tests are designed(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to establish(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) whether people have previously been infected(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) , as opposed(#overlap 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to antigen tests which show(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) if someone actually has(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) the COVID-19 disease caused(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) by the pandemic .
REUTERS Health technology firm Mologic , which created one of the first at - home pregnancy tests said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) assessment(#included this week) and validation(#included this week) of a 10 - minute coronavirus antibody test , which will cost about a $ 1 had begun(#included this week) this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St Georges hospital , and that global partners would also examine(#after 2020-03-26 19:56:59) prototypes .
Joe Fitchett , Mologic medical director , said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) that while many companies were working(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) on virus diagnostics , the aim was to create(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) cheap , widely available tests .
“ virus diagnostics must be made(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) available to the vulnerable and most precious in society , in the UK or elsewhere , ” Joe Fitchett , Mologic medical director , told(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) Reuters .
“ Joe Fitchett , Mologic medical director , would be really disappointed(#included currently) to see(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) a good test that is shown(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to work(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to be sold(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) on Amazon only be used(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) by a tiny proportion of the population . ”
GAME - CHANGER
Britain has bought(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) 3.5 million antibody testing kits from different suppliers , and is currently making(#included currently) sure 3.5 million antibody testing kits work(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) before distributing(#included currently) 3.5 million antibody testing kits .
A health official told(#included Wednesday) lawmakers on Wednesday that such test kits would be available within days to be sent(#after 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to households , perhaps via Amazon , saying(#included this week) that an unnamed prototype was being validated(#included this week) in Oxford this week .
But officials are cautious about the trade - off between producing(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) something as quickly as possible and making(#overlap 2020-03-26 19:56:59) sure that the tests work(#after 2020-03-26 19:56:59) .
Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty later dampened(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) expectations of quick widespread availability for the tests , saying(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) inaccurate tests(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) would be dangerous .
“ ( The ) technology is quite close(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) , and ( The ) technology ’s being evaluated(#included this week) this week , but ( The ) technology ’s not there ...
The one thing that ’s worse than no test is a bad test , ” Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) .
“ Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty do not think(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) ...
that The one thing that ’s worse than no test is something we ’ll suddenly be ordering(#included next week) on the internet next week . ”
Asked(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) why Britain bought(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) 3.5 million tests which might not work(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) , Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s spokesman said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) : “ If Britain are able to find(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) an antibody test which works(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) 3.5 million tests could be a game - changer . ”
“ For find you will understand(#included currently) that government is doing everything that government can to seek(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to find(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) a test which works(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) , ” Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s spokesman added(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) .
REUTERS Health technology firm Mologic , which created one of the first at - home pregnancy tests said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) that after assessment(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) in Britain , prototypes would be shipped(#after 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to validation(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) partners in China , the United States , Malaysia , Spain , Brazil and Senegal .
Joe Fitchett , Mologic medical director , said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) REUTERS Health technology firm Mologic , which created one of the first at - home pregnancy tests had not received(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) any orders from Britain and was cautious that other tests may be ready to roll(#after 2020-03-26 19:56:59) out in Britain in days .
“ Where the confusion has been , the confusion has been made(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to sound like the confusion is confirmed(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) or imminent .
And for me that is very problematic , ” Joe Fitchett , Mologic medical director , said(#before 2020-03-26 19:56:59) .
“ You need(#overlap 2020-03-26 19:56:59) to be clear about the validation requirements . ”
