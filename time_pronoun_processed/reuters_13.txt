REUTERS / Carlo Allegri Bank of America was the first major bank to announce(#included 2020-04-03) REUTERS / Carlo Allegri Bank of America involvement(#included 2020-04-03) in the relief program on Friday , saying(#included 2020-04-03) REUTERS / Carlo Allegri Bank of America had processed(#included 2020-04-03) tens of thousands of loans within just a few hours .
JPMorgan Chase followed(#included Friday afternoon) around noon , saying(#included 2020-04-03) customers could apply(#after 2020-04-03 21:08:48) through JPMorgan Chase website .
Earlier in Friday , REUTERS / Carlo Allegri Bank of America had warned(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) small business customers that REUTERS / Carlo Allegri Bank of America could not accept(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) applications until receiving(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department .

While smaller banks were already participating(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) - helping(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) the U.S. Treasury Department originate(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) nearly $ 900 million worth of loans soon after the relief program kicked(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) off - smaller banks touch(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) a huge portion of U.S. households , and can get(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) money out the door much more quickly to customers who already have(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) accounts with smaller banks .
But smaller banks were reluctant(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) to participate(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) in the relief program because initial guidelines from the U.S. Treasury Department suggested(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) lenders would be responsible for vetting(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) applicants - and therefore might be on the hook later for fraud or other misdeeds that occur(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) .
The industry threatened(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) to boycott(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) the relief program unless the government addressed(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) those concerns , Reuters reported(#included 2020-04-01) here on Wednesday .

But banks , which are handling(#overlap 2020-04-03 21:08:48) aid requests(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) , lacked(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) guidance on how the relief program should work(#before PAST_REF) until a few days ago .
In the meantime , confused customers flooded(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) confused customers phone lines trying(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) to apply(#before 2020-04-03 21:08:48) .
