There are now almost 91,000 cases globally , including(#included now) 80,000 in China , and over 3,000 people have died(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) .

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) in a joint statement(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) that IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass goal was to serve(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass membership effectively while ensuring(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) the health and safety of participants and staff .
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said(#included Monday) some 10,000 government officials , business people , civil society representatives and journalists from across the globe would leverage(#after 2020-03-03 19:07:28) IT - related and virtual connection capabilities to hold(#after 2020-03-03 19:07:28) essential policy consultations , while continuing(#overlap 2020-03-03 19:07:28) to share(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank analyses .

An IMF official said(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) that one possible exception to the virtual meetings shift(#before 2020-03-03 19:07:28) is that the 24 - member International Monetary and Financial Committee - the Fund ’s steering committee - may still meet(#after 2020-03-03 19:07:28) face to face .
Details for meet are still being worked(#after 2020-03-03 19:07:28) out , An IMF official said(#included Monday) .
