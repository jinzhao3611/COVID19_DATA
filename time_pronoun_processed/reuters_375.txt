Some analysts said(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda ’s campaign(#included May 10) appears to have lost(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) steam amid political infighting(#overlap 2020-05-22 15:24:05) , with the opposition accusing(#included May 10) the government of failing(#included May 10) to ensure(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) fair and free voting(#included May 10) in the government preparations(#included May 10) for a May 10 ballot .
The ruling nationalists have pushed(#included June 28) for an election expected to take place in coming weeks to be held(#included as soon as possible) as soon as possible , wary that a growing(#overlap 2020-05-22 15:24:05) economic downturn(#overlap 2020-05-22 15:24:05) could erode(#after 2020-05-22 15:24:05) the chances of Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda .
Government officials say(#included June 28) May 10 is now the most likely date .
Support for Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda has fallen(#after April) 20 percentage points since April , according to a May 18 - 19 survey by the Kantar pollster , reaching(#included coming weeks) 39 % .
Another poll , by IBRiS , showed(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda at 43 % .
Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda had polled(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) as high as 63 % shortly before an election expected to take place in coming weeks , Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda popularity driven(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) in part by an election(#included February 3 , 2020) boycott(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) announced(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) by the biggest opposition party , the centrist Civic Platform ( PO ) .
A the biggest opposition party , the centrist Civic Platform ( PO ) announcement(#included 2020-W13) last week to replace(#included 2020-W13) Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda candidate with popular Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski appears to have galvanised(#included 2020-W13) centrist voters .
A prominent defender of gay rights , a highly divisive issue in Poland , Trzaskowski could win(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) 18 % in the presidential ballot , securing(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) second place , a May 18 - 19 survey by the Kantar pollster showed(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) .
Despite falling(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) support , Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda is still likely to secure(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) re - election , the Kantar pollster said(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) .
If Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda fails(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) to win(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) more than 50 % of vote(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) , Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda will have to compete(#after 2020-05-22 15:24:05) with the runner up in a second round .
Kantar showed(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda winning(#before 2020-05-22 15:24:05) 48 % to popular Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski ’s 41 % .
