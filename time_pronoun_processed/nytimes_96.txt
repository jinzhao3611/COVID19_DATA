“ With Brandon Baez being in the military , there ’s no telling where Brandon Baez ’s going(#included PRESENT_REF) to be a year from now , ” said(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) Maggie Moore
“ We thought(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) it was important to go(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) ahead and do it now . ”
Brandon Baez is a Navy seaman stationed(#overlap 2020-04-25 09:00:31) in Dahlgren , Va. ; Maggie Moore is a certified nursing assistant at the Oakwood Health and Rehabilitation Center in Bedford , Va.
Before social distancing(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) restrictions(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) set(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) in , they were planning(#included 2017) a small wedding(#included 2017) near Maggie Moore ’s home .
But not so small that they families and a handful of they friends from Liberty High School in Bedford , Va. , where they met(#included 2017) in 2017 , could n’t attend(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) .
“ We were just getting(#included Austin) ready to make(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) a down payment on a place when the corona stuff came(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) out and the governor said(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) weddings have to be less than 10 people , ” Maggie Moore said(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) .
The venue they had chosen(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) was n’t offering(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) discounts for couples who planned(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) to forge(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) ahead with pared - down weddings(#after 2020-04-25 09:00:31) .

“ Maggie Moore had been to weddings(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) there before , and it ’s beautiful , and our immediate families could still be there , so our considered(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) that a blessing , ” Maggie Moore said(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) .
Though Maggie Moore is just a few months past legal marriage age in Va. , the couple ’s youth has not been a concern among those who know(#overlap 2020-04-25 09:00:31) the couple ’s youth .
“ Some people are like , ‘ Wow , you ’re really young , ’ ” Maggie Moore said(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) .
“ But it ’s not unheard - of to get(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) married(#included Earlier this month) young in a rural area like this .
And Brandon Baez being in the military is something Maggie Moore think(#before 2020-04-25 09:00:31) is very respectable . ”
