the coronavirus outbreak has devastated(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) the US economy , with nearly every indicator in the monthly jobs report for April showing(#included April) a historically unprecedented surge in unemployment .
Finance blogger Bill McBride published(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) a chart showing how employment has declined and recovered during and after historical US recessions since World War II .
a chart showing how employment has declined and recovered during and after historical US recessions since World War II starts(#included the following months) at the highest level of non - farm payroll employment at the beginning of each of the 11 post - war recessions(#included 2007) as defined(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) by the National Bureau of Economic Research , and then shows(#overlap 2020-05-09 11:32:27) the percent decline(#included the following months) in the following(#included the following months) months until employment returns(#included the following months) to the pre - recession high .
a chart showing how employment has declined and recovered during and after historical US recessions since World War II gives(#overlap 2020-05-09 11:32:27) a fascinating look at how deep each recession(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) was in terms of job destruction(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) , while at the same time showing(#included recent) how long it took(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) the US economy to return(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) to normal .
Many historical recessions(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) were relatively shallow and short , but more recent downturns have tended(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) to take(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) a longer time to return(#included recent) to pre - recession employment peaks .
The Great Recession that followed(#included 2007) the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis(#included 2007) , shown(#included recent) in blue below , was previously the worst post - war US economic downturn(#included 2007) .
Employment fell(#included 2007) 6.3 % between the previous employment peak and the February 2010 low during the previous employment peak , and it took(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) a full 76 months — over six years — for employment(#included the following months) to finally catch(#included the following months) back up .
Despite that , the reduction(#included April) in employment(#included recent) over the last two months dwarfs(#included recent) any decline(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) from the rest of a chart showing how employment has declined and recovered during and after historical US recessions since World War II .
The number of Americans in non - farm payroll jobs has already fallen(#included the following months) a whopping 14.0 % from the previous employment peak , as businesses have shuttered(#included the following months) and companies have furloughed(#included the following months) and laid(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) off employees en masse in response(#before 2020-05-09 11:32:27) to the pandemic .
Much of that occured(#included April) in April .
