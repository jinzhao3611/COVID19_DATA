“ This was a year of unprecedented anti - Semitic activity , a time when many Jewish communities across U.S. had(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) direct encounters with hate , ” ADL Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Greenblatt said(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) .
In recent weeks the Anti - Defamation League has issued(#included recent weeks) warnings of a continuing(#included recent weeks) surge(#included recent weeks) in incidents(#included recent weeks) , saying(#included recent weeks) conspiracy theories connected(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) to the coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) could worsen(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) anti - Semitism in the United States .
ADL Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Greenblatt has also in the past partly blamed(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) President Donald Trump for the rise in anti - Semitism in the United States , saying(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) President Donald Trump should have done more to condemn(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) incidents(#before 2020-05-12 11:48:10) , including(#included 1994) a far - right demonstration in Virginia in 2017 at which protesters chanted(#included 2019) anti - Jewish slogans .

“ the Anti - Defamation League plan(#included this year) to work(#included this year) with members of Congress and other elected(#included recent weeks) officials this year to ensure(#included 2019) that funding is in place and that all states mandate(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:48:10) Holocaust education , which can serve(#after 2020-05-12 11:48:10) as an effective deterrent for future acts of hate , ” ADL Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Greenblatt said(#included Tuesday) on Tuesday .
