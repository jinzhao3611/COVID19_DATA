The struggle(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) between Mahathir , 94 , and Anwar , has shaped(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Malaysian politics for more than two decades and is at the root of the latest crisis .
Mahathir proposed(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) a unified administration without political party allegiances at a time Malaysia faces(#overlap 2020-02-26 12:50:05) a flagging(#overlap 2020-02-26 12:50:05) economy and the impact of the new coronavirus .
“ Politics and political parties need(#Depend-on 2020-02-26 12:50:05) to be put(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) aside for now , ” Mahathir said(#included Wednesday) in a televised(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) message .
“ Mahathir propose(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) a government that is not aligned(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) with any party , but only prioritises(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) the interests of KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Malaysia . ”
Anwar later said(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Anwar opposed(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) forming a “ backdoor government ” and that three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition had proposed(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Anwar name to the king as candidate for prime minister .
“ We wait(#overlap 2020-02-26 12:50:05) for the decision(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) of the king , ” Anwar told(#included Wednesday) a news conference(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) .
To try(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) to end(#after 2020-02-26 12:50:05) the latest crisis , the king has been meeting(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) all 222 elected(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) members of parliament over two days .
three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition said(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition were asked(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) to name(#included February 26 , 2020) three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition favoured prime minister or whether three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition wanted(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) fresh elections .
Anwar ’s Parti Keadilan Rakyat ( PKR ) , or the People ’s Justice Party , has(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) 39 seats and alliance partners could potentially give(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Anwar ’s Parti Keadilan Rakyat ( PKR ) , or the People ’s Justice Party another 62 .
While some politicians have openly voiced(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) support for Mahathir to stay(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) in office , it was not clear whether enough of some politicians would give(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Mahathir some politicians backing .
POLITICAL TANGLE
The volatile relationship between KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Malaysia ’s decades - old political rivals Mahathir Mohamad and Anwar Ibrahim helped(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) prompt(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) the latest crisis(#included Wednesday) after Mahathir resisted(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) pressure to set(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) a date for a promised(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) transfer(#included 2018) of power to Anwar made(#included 2018) ahead of a 2018 election .
As well as personal relationships
, politics in Malaysia is shaped(#overlap 2020-02-26 12:50:05) by a tangle of ethnic and religious interests .
Malaysia is more than half ethnic Malay , but has(#overlap 2020-02-26 12:50:05) large ethnic Chinese , Indian and other minorities .
A unity government cutting(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) across party lines could give(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Mahathir greater authority than during a spell as prime minister from 1981 until Mahathir retirement(#included 2003) in 2003 .
But the idea was rejected(#included Tuesday) on Tuesday by an alliance of four parties including(#included Tuesday) the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) , which ruled(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Malaysia for six decades until being defeated(#included 2018) by Mahathir ’s coalition in 2018 .
three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition said(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition had told(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) Mahathir three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition wanted(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) a new election(#included 2018) instead .
After three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition election(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) defeat(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) under former prime minister Najib Razak , those parties ’ fortunes have been on the rise(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) while the Pakatan coalition of Mahathir and Anwar has lost(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) five by - elections Anwar was Mahathir ’s deputy and a rising(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) political star when Mahathir was prime minister the first time but the Pakatan coalition of Mahathir and Anwar fell out .
Anwar was arrested(#included the late 1990s) and jailed(#included the late 1990s) in the late 1990s for sodomy and corruption , charges(#included the late 1990s) that Anwar and his supporters maintain(#before 2020-02-26 12:50:05) were aimed(#included the late 1990s) at ending(#included the late 1990s) Anwar political career .
