Jet Airways operated(#included April 17 last year) Jet Airways last flight(#included April 17 last year) between Amritsar - Mumbai on April 17 last year as lenders turned(#included April 17 last year) down Jet Airways demand for an emergency(#included April 17 last year) funding .
The Naresh Goyal - founded airline , among the first private carriers to take to the skies in 1993 , collapsed(#included 1993) under a mountain of debt and a cash crunch .
The Naresh Goyal - founded airline , among the first private carriers to take to the skies in 1993 , is under insolvency(#included PRESENT_REF) since last June with admitted(#after 2019-06) claims to the tune of Rs 16,000 crore .
Now , the Covid-19 crisis(#included PRESENT_REF) has dashed(#included PRESENT_REF) The Naresh Goyal - founded airline , among the first private carriers to take to the skies in 1993 , revival(#included PRESENT_REF) prospects .
Before the nationwide lockdown(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) , the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) granted(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) an additional three months to Jet Airways resolution professional to find(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) a suitor on the grounds that lenders would get(#after 2020-04-16 13:15:31) better value for their assets if their assets were sold(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) via a formal resolution plan , instead of the liquidation route .
Till last year , the Russian Development Fund and Prudent ARC were in the fray to revive(#after 2019-06) Jet Airways , but did not submit(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) a concrete plan .
“ In view of the order passed(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) by the NCLAT in suo moto appeal(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) , the period during which there is a lockdown(#after 2019-06) will be excluded(#after 2020-04-16 13:15:31) while calculating(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) the period of resolution process , ” , said(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) Ashish Pyasi Associate Partner Dhir and Dhir Associates .
“ By giving(#included PRESENT_REF) extension , the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) gave(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) additional life to the process so that viable resolution plan can be explored(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) .
It is pertinent to note(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) that the nature of assets is such that in liquidation(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) assets may not fetch(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) the same value and may become(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) obsolete .
Therefore , for maximisation(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) of asset value it is important that some viable resolution plan is explored(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) , ' Ashish Pyasi Associate Partner Dhir added(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) .
However , bankers believe(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) given(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) the current situation , a revival(#included PRESENT_REF) for Jet Airways looks(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) very difficult .
" Overall aviation industry is in a crisis(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) and airlines have(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) cash flow problem .
Expecting(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) a company to submit(#after 2020-04-16 13:15:31) a revival(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) plan for looks(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) out of question(#overlap 2020-04-16 13:15:31) .
Even realising(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) good value from liquidation would be difficult(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) as globally airlines are grounding(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) planes , " said(#before 2020-04-16 13:15:31) a bank executive .
