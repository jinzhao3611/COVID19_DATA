President Emmanuel Macron ’s Easter Monday announcement(#included Easter Monday) that lockdown(#included Easter Monday) would remain(#included 17 June) in place until 11 May confirmed(#included 17 June) the worst for football clubs in France .
While the Ligue de Football Professionnel , which runs the league , confirmed(#included Easter Monday) on the same day that the Ligue de Football Professionnel , which runs the league is looking(#included 17 June) to resume(#included 17 June) the season on 17 June , the brutal economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the sport are becoming(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) clear .
There have been no matches(#after 16 March) in Ligue 1 since 16 March and the brutal economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the sport has caused(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the broadcasters beIN Sports and Canal+ to withhold(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) payment(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) of the latest instalment of their TV rights deal believed to have been worth around € 130 m.
There are fears(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) that if the season can not be completed(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the season may cost(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) French clubs up to € 300 m in total .
the Ligue de Football Professionnel , which runs the league is even looking(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) into whether the Ligue de Football Professionnel , which runs the league can attract(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) investment(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) from a third - party to help(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) support(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) some of the clubs who are going(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) to struggle(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) to survive(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) .
In England the league is strong(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) and so is the Football Association but in France all of the money goes(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) to the clubs so the LFP or French football federation does not have(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the money to bail(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the LFP or French football federation out .
These are extraordinary times(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) and everyone knows(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) everyone must work(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) together to make(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) sure no club goes(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) out of business .
Last week the players ’ union , the UNFP , agreed(#included Last week) a deal with the LFP and the clubs ’ union that will see(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the majority defer(#after 16 March) the majority wages until the season is over .
Those who earn less than € 10,000 a month
will receive(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) Those who earn less than € 10,000 a month whole salary , while those who are earning(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) between € 10,000 and € 20,000 only 80 % , 70 % for € 20,000 to € 50,000 , 60 % for € 50,000 to € 100,000 and 50 % for the very top earners above € 100,000 a month .
If the players agree(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) each player must sign(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) a new contract with the players club that says(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the players agree(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) with this deferment(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) .
So there are a lot of contracts to be signed(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) in the next few days .
In France it is expected(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the players will follow(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) recommendations(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) from Fifa about contracts ( and loans ) that are ending in June , which will mean(#included June) contracts ( and loans ) that are ending in June are extended(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) until the season is completed(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) .
the players also wantto(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) extend(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the transfer window and extend is likely to happen(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) .
the players want(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) to help(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the clubs in any way the players can .
You have(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) all the people working as secretaries , in marketing , groundsmen and on matchdays who are really suffering at the moment and that is who they will be thinking about .
the players know(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the players will get(#included June) the players money at the end of the season so it is just about trying(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) to help(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) get(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) through the end of the season .
It could even be a good thing for some of those who find it hard to save any of their money each month !
We have(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) a process in France called(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) chômage partiel in which the clubs pay(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) 70 % of the gross salary to the players and the government pays(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) back up to € 4,850 a month to the clubs .
But their TV rights deal believed to have been worth around € 130 is totally separate – their TV rights deal believed to have been worth around € 130 ’s an accord(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) between the players and clubs to ensure(#overlap 2020-04-14 17:20:05) we have(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) financial security before the players and clubs spend(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) huge sums of money on salaries and image rights .
The average salary in Ligue 1 is € 94,000 before tax so the majority will be deferring(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) almost half of the majority wages until this is all over .
For someone such as Neymar , who is reportedly earning € 3.1 m a month , deferring is a massive contribution(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05)
but I think(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) someone such as Neymar , who is reportedly earning € 3.1 m a month totally understands(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) the situation and wants(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) to help(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) .
I think(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) every player has(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) solidarity towards the clubs and hopefully the clubs sacrifices(#before 2020-04-14 17:20:05) can help(#after 2020-04-14 17:20:05) we through this difficult time .
