Warren says(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) Warren brother’s coronavirus death(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) ‘feels(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) like something that didn’t have to happen’(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) .

In the interview(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) with the Atlantic ’s Edward - Isaac Dovere , Warren reflected(#included April 21) on the final days of Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus .
“ [ T]hen Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus got(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) sick , and then Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus died(#included April 21) , by Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus , ” Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) of Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus .
“ That ’s the hard part — really hard part . ”
Warren added(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , “ It just feels(#included recent weeks) like something that did n’t have to happen(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) . ”
Warren grieving(#overlap 2020-05-18 05:50:24) the loss(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) of T]hen from a distance has become(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) both familiar and identifiable in a pandemic with nearly 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 88,000 deaths .
In recent weeks , Warren has joined(#included recent weeks) President Trump , former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D - Minn. ) as top political figures with family members or friends who ’ve been directly affected(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) by a pandemic with nearly 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 88,000 deaths .
While it ’s unclear(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) how Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus contracted(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) the coronavirus , The Washington Post ’s Annie Linskey and Felicia Sonmez reported(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) that Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus had been in a rehabilitation center where several other people had active cases of the virus .
Warren recounted(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) how her brother was ready to leave(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) a rehabilitation center where several other people had active cases of the virus when her brother was told(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) her brother was not allowed(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) to exit(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) after learning(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) someone had tested(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) positive for a pandemic with nearly 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 88,000 deaths .
“ Warren called(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) her brother every day for 11 days , and every day her brother would say(#included recent weeks) , ‘ her brother ’m just fine , ’ ” Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) to the Atlantic .
“ In fact , her brother said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , ‘ her brother think(#included recent weeks) her brother probably had(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) a pandemic with nearly 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 88,000 deaths before and ’ve just too tough and did n’t even notice(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) . ’ ”
But when her brother own coronavirus test(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) came(#included recent weeks) back positive , Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) it felt(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) like Warren could n’t breathe(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) .
“ And Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , ‘ Bets ’ — her brother ’d call(#included recent weeks) Warren Bets or Betsy always — ‘ Warren feel(#overlap 2020-05-18 05:50:24) fine .
Warren feel fine , ’ ” Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) .
Warren added(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , “ her brother ’d tell(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) Warren , ‘ Oh , it ’s fine , ’ and laugh .
And her brother was irritated(#overlap 2020-05-18 05:50:24) that her brother could n’t leave(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) .
And Warren had begun(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) to think(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , This is okay .
’ve going(#after 2020-05-18 05:50:24) to get(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) her brother out of there . ”
That ’s when her brother condition took(#included February) a turn .
After her brother did n’t answer(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) his phone , Warren found(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) out that Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus was in intensive care .
Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) Warren spoke(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) to Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus once again on his phone .
Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus speech(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) was slurred(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) and Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus was confined(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) to a bed but remained(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) optimistic .
Herring , who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus passed(#included last week) away shortly thereafter .
Since her brother ’s death(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , Warren has underscored(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) the urgency for the United States to prepare(#overlap 2020-05-18 05:50:24) for a second potential wave of a pandemic with nearly 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 88,000 deaths in the fall .
During last week ’s Senate hearing(#included last week) , Anthony S. Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , agreed(#included last week) with Warren ’s assessment(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , saying(#included last week) “ there would be problems ” in regard to another outbreak(#included later this year) later this year if testing(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) and contact(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) tracing(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) does n’t improve and if social distancing does n’t continue .
On Sunday , Warren acknowledged(#included Sunday) to the Atlantic that the feelings Warren and tens of thousands of American families who ’ve lost(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) loved(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) ones to the coronavirus share was “ something none of us were prepared(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) for . ”
“ It ’s always hard to lose(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) someone you love(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) , ” Warren said(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) .
“ But to lose(#before 2020-05-18 05:50:24) someone when you have to wonder(#overlap 2020-05-18 05:50:24) : What were someone last days like ?
Were someone afraid ?
Were someone cold ?
Were someone lonely ?
That is a kind of grief that is new to all of us . ”
