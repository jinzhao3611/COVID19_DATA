By Andy Bruce LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The true extent of UK's COVID-19 death toll was more than 40 % higher than the government 's daily figures indicated(#included April 10) as of April 10 , according to data that put(#included April 10) Britain 's on track to become(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) among the worst - hit in Europe .
The Office for National Statistics said(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) The Office for National Statistics recorded(#included April 10) 13,121 deaths(#included April 10) by April 10 in England and Wales , which account(#included April 10) for the vast majority of Britain 's population , compared(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) with 9,288 in the government 's daily toll for those who died(#included April 10) in hospital .
The ONS figures include(#overlap 2020-04-21 20:33:54) deaths(#included April 10) in care homes and hospices as well as in hospitals .
Britain 's , has reported(#included now) UK's COVID-19 death toll .
The global death(#included now) toll from COVID-19 now stands(#included now) at around 170,000 .
The latest hospital death(#included this Sunday) data show(#included now) 16,509 people with COVID-19 had died(#included this Sunday) across Britain 's as of this Sunday .
If The ONS figures underestimate(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) the overall death toll by a similar amount , then the true human cost for Britain 's could be above 23,000 based(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) on the latest data - making(#included Tuesday) Britain 's the second worst hit in Europe after Italy .
However , the difference between the initial daily figures published(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) by the government 's and the later The Office for National Statistics data has narrowed(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) with each week that passes(#overlap 2020-04-21 20:33:54) , and may have reduced(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) further by the time The Office for National Statistics reports(#after 2020-04-21 20:33:54) on the overall death toll .
Still , The ONS figures are likely to raise(#included Tuesday) further questions about Britain 's decision(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) to impose(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) Britain 's lockdown of society at a later date than European peers , many of which have had(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) less severe outbreaks(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) of the novel coronavirus .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still on sick leave(#overlap 2020-04-21 20:33:54) after falling(#included Tuesday) ill with COVID-19 as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ministers attempt(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) to tackle(#after 2020-04-21 20:33:54) urgent issues such as a shortage of personal protective equipment for health workers .
DEADLIEST WEEK
Including(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) all deaths(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) , 18,516 people died(#included April 10) in England and Wales during the seven days to April 10 - almost 8,000 more than normal for the time of year and marking(#included April 10) the deadliest week since a severe flu outbreak(#included April 10) more than 20 years ago .
Martin Hibberd , professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) The ONS figures marked(#included Tuesday) a " rapid " increase(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) .
" With limited testing(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) being carried(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) out , it may be that all of the 7,996 excess deaths were directly due to COVID-19 , " Martin Hibberd , professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) .
"
( But ) it is also likely that at least some of all of the 7,996 excess deaths were indirectly involved(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) , such as through inability to access typical medical care for other conditions because of COVID-19 activities . " COVID-19 was mentioned(#included the) in a third of all death(#included the) certificates issued(#included the) in England and Wales in the week to April 10 .
In London , more than half of the death(#included that week) certificates issued(#included that week) that week mentioned(#included that week) COVID-19 .
The ONS figures are based(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) on mentions(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) of COVID-19 on death certificates , whether or not the deceased(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) had tested(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) positive for coronavirus .
" In care homes settings there are now double the number of deaths(#included now) from all causes ... than there were two weeks previously , " The Office for National Statistics statistician Nick Stripe told(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) the BBC .
" About 17 % of those deaths(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) mention(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) COVID on the death(#before 2020-04-21 20:33:54) certificate . "
