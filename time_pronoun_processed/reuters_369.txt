But it was not all bad news for Novak Djokovic .
“ Unlike many other players , Novak Djokovic was able to train(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) almost every day because his family resided(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) in a house with a tennis court , ” Novak Djokovic told(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) a news conference(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) at Novak Djokovic private tennis complex in downtown Belgrade by the Danube river .
“ Novak Djokovic refrained(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) from posting(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) clips on social networks because Novak Djokovic did n’t want(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) to infuriate(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) other players .
Novak Djokovic am fit and in good shape , so Novak Djokovic am looking(#overlap 2020-05-25 17:51:19) forward to the upcoming Adria Tour tennis tournament , in Belgrade , Serbia , May 25 , 2020 . ”

“ Novak Djokovic am delighted that Dominic Thiem , Grigor Dimitrov and Alexander Zverev will be Novak Djokovic guests here in the Spanish resort of Marbella , ” said(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) Novak Djokovic .
“ This is the first time any of Dominic Thiem , Grigor Dimitrov and Alexander Zverev will be playing(#included Sunday) here and Novak Djokovic will do everything in Novak Djokovic power to be a good host .
“ We would dearly love(#Depend-on 2020-05-25 17:51:19) for fans to be able to attend(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) but that ’s still not certain because We have to abide(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) by the Serbian government ’s coronavirus regulations(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) . ”
The first leg will take(#included June 13) place on red clay in Belgrade , Serbia on June 13 and 14 at Novak Djokovic ’s complex and the second in Croatia ’s coastal resort Zadar on June 20 and 21 .
Montenegro and Bosnia have been designated(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) to host(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) the final two legs but Novak Djokovic said(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) the infrastructure was still not in place .
“ Montenegro and Bosnia are still not 100 % certain as the hosts of the final two legs because his family have n’t had(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) enough time to prepare(#overlap 2020-05-25 17:51:19) the infrastructure , but his family are very nearly there .
“ As for the three big names coming over , the three big names coming over will all play(#after 2020-05-25 17:51:19) in the opening leg in Belgrade , Serbia .
Alexander Zverev might play(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) in Croatia too while Grigor Dimitrov could appear in Croatia and in Montenegro . ”
the three big names coming over will feature(#after 2020-05-25 17:51:19) eight players , competing(#after 2020-05-25 17:51:19) in two pools of four on a round - robin basis with the winners of each pool advancing(#included June 13) to the final .
Novak Djokovic added(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) sets would be slashed(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) to winning(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) four games instead of six , with a total of 13 matches to be played(#after 2020-05-25 17:51:19) over two days in each leg .
Asked(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) whether Novak Djokovic considered(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) inviting(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) longtime rivals Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal to Balkan event , Novak Djokovic said(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) : “ Quite frankly , inviting(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) Novak Djokovic did n’t cross(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) Novak Djokovic mind because ... Novak Djokovic is still nursing(#overlap 2020-05-25 17:51:19) a knee injury .
“ As for Rafael Nadal , Novak Djokovic have(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) no problem giving(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) Novak Djokovic a call
but Novak Djokovic would n’t expect(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) Novak Djokovic to come(#before 2020-05-25 17:51:19) over . ”
