BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Air pollution has decreased(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) in urban areas across Europe during lockdowns(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) to combat(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) the coronavirus , new satellite images showed(#included 2020-03-30) on Monday , but campaigners warned(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) city - dwellers were still more vulnerable to the epidemic .
A general view shows(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) houses and office buildings in Brussels during the lockdown(#included March 27 , 2020) imposed(#included March 27 , 2020) by the Belgian government to slow(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) down the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) outbreak(#included March 27 , 2020) , in Brussels , March 27 , 2020 .

Lenoir Cities including(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) Brussels , Paris , Madrid , Milan and Frankfurt showed(#included 2019) a reduction(#included 2019) in average levels of noxious nitrogen dioxide over March 5 - 25 , compared(#included 2019) with the same period last year , according to the Sentinel-5 satellite images .
showed coincides(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) with lockdowns(#included March 5) in many European countries which have curbed(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) road transport – the largest source of nitrogen oxides - and slowed(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) output at gas - emitting(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) factories .
the Sentinel-5 satellite images show(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) the changing(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) density of nitrogen dioxide , which can cause(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) respiratory problems and cancer , like heat maps .
Daily weather events can influence(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) atmospheric pollution , so the satellite pictures took(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) a 20 - day average and excluded(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) readings where cloud cover reduced(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) the quality of the data .
Data from the European Environment Agency ( EEA ) showed(#included March 16) a similar trend over March 16 - 22 .
In Madrid , average nitrogen dioxide levels decreased(#included March 5) by 56 % week - on - week after the Belgian government banned(#included March 14) non - essential travel(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) on March 14 .
the non - profit European Public Health Alliance ( EPHA ) said(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) people living(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) in polluted cities may be more at risk from COVID-19 , because prolonged exposure to bad air can weaken(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) the immune system , making(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) it harder to fight(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) infection .
“ That connection is very likely , ” Zoltan Massay - Kosubek , policy manager for clean air at the non - profit European Public Health Alliance ( EPHA ) , told(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) Reuters .
“ But because the epidemic is new , the epidemic still has to be demonstrated(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) . ”
Air pollution can cause(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) or exacerbate(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) lung cancer , pulmonary disease and strokes(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) .
China also recorded(#included February) a drop in nitrogen dioxide pollution in cities during February , when China imposed(#included February) draconian lockdown(#included February) measures(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) to contain(#included February) the epidemic .
In some regions of Poland , however , nitrogen dioxide levels remained(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) relatively high during the period despite the epidemic lockdown(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) , perhaps due to the prevalence of coal - based heating .
Countries that went(#included February) into lockdown(#included March 16) later - such as Britain , which did so on March 23 - look(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) set(#included coming) for a pollution reprieve in coming weeks
, the non - profit European Public Health Alliance ( EPHA ) said(#before 2020-03-30 02:31:51) .
Air pollution causes(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) around 400,000 premature deaths(#after 2020-03-30 02:31:51) each year in Europe , the European Environment Agency ( EEA ) data show(#overlap 2020-03-30 02:31:51) .
