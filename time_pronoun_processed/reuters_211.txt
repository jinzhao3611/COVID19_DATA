Most schools will close(#included Friday) from Friday , although some will be asked(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) to stay(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) open to support(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the children of essential workers like health care employees , education minister Gavin Williamson told(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) parliament .
“ education minister Gavin Williamson know(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the situation has become(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) increasingly challenging(#overlap 2020-03-18 18:28:25) .
education minister Gavin Williamson said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) before that if the science and the advice changed(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) such that keeping(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) schools open would no longer be in the best interests of children and teachers that LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain would act(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) , ” education minister Gavin Williamson said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) .
“ We are now at that stage .
The spike of the virus is increasing(#overlap 2020-03-18 18:28:25) at a faster pace than anticipated(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) . ”
The shutting of so many schools will have(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) huge economic and social repercussions for the world ’s fifth - biggest economy .
The shutting of so many schools will alter(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the lives of almost 9 million British children and force parents to stay(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) home from work to look(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) after almost 9 million British children .
The decision(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) came(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) after headteachers were increasingly having to turn(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) away pupils anyway because of staff shortages .
The move(#included 2020-04-01) to shut(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) schools is a reversal(#included recent) of the government ’s recent cautious stance(#included recent) towards tackling(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the virus .
Britain had previously resisted(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) pressure(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) to follow(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the lead of Italy , France , and Spain , saying(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) that school closures would not halt(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the spread of coronavirus and would deprive(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) Britain of key public sector workers .
EXAMS CANCELLED
All exams will be cancelled(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) , but the government will find(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) a way to ensure(#overlap 2020-03-18 18:28:25) students get(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) students qualifications , education minister Gavin Williamson said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) .
The school closure comes(#overlap 2020-03-18 18:28:25) after the number of deaths(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) of people who tested(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) positive for coronavirus in England rose(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) to 99 , a 48 % jump from the day before .
Earlier , Scotland announced(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) Scotland would close(#included Friday) its schools from Friday and the government in Edinburgh said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) there was no guarantee its schools will reopen(#before the summer) before the summer .
“ Scotland will of course only keep(#overlap 2020-03-18 18:28:25) its schools closed for as long as Scotland absolutely have to , ” said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) first minister Nicola Sturgeon .
“ But at that stage , education minister Gavin Williamson can not promise(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) that its schools will reopen(#before the summer) before the summer holidays . ”
education minister Gavin Williamson said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) some schools will stay(#overlap 2020-03-18 18:28:25) open to support(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) the children of key workers like doctors , the police or delivery drivers , including(#included Easter holidays) during the summer holidays .
However , stay means some children will go(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) to different schools , if some children own has been shut(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) down .
Kevin Courtney , joint General Secretary of the National Education Union , welcomed(#included 2020-04-01) announced .
“ It is better for announced to take(#after 2020-03-18 18:28:25) place in an ordered(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) way than the chaotic pattern of closures that was developing(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) , ” Kevin Courtney , joint General Secretary of the National Education Union , said(#before 2020-03-18 18:28:25) .
