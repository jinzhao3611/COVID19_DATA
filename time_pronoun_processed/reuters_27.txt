Speed of loan issuance had been given(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) a high priority , but lenders have voiced(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) concerns about potential liabilities for fraud , anti - money laundering violations(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) and other legal requirements .
“ Financial institutions like ours are still awaiting(#overlap 2020-04-03 00:23:55) guidance(#after 2020-04-03 00:23:55) from SBA and U.S. Treasury , ” JPMorgan Chase
Co ( JPM.N ) said(#included 2020-04-02) in an email on Thursday to small business customers on Thursday .

Bankers say(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) Bankers a $ 349 billion coronavirus rescue loan program for small businesses despite confusion over last - minute final rules and lenders unprepared to approve applications could be depleted(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) quickly .
“ We anticipate(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) more demand than supply , ” said(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) Tony Wilkinson , president of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders , which represents SBA and other lenders .
“ We ’ve got(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) to get(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) lenders comfortable with the rules so that We ’ve know(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) that when We ’ve originate(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) a loan , counting on a government guarantee , that We ’ve doing the things necessary so that We ’ve actually have(#before 2020-04-03 00:23:55) the government guarantee . ”
