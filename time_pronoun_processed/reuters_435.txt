But this year , the novel coronavirus has brought(#included this year) a Ramadan like never before , with shuttered(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) mosques and strict physical distancing regulations , and so Indonesian tutor Ahmad Winardi has moved(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) Indonesian tutor Ahmad Winardi Islamic studies online .
One consequence is that the courses , previously held(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) only in cities on the islands of Java and Sumatra , have this year attracted(#included this year) a wider range of students in the archipelago , including(#included this year) from Indonesian Borneo .
“ Due to COVID-19 , we ’re restricted(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) from activities outside we ’re houses so we ’re started(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) the online Islamic course , ” said(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) Gemia Indria , one of the organisers .
“ And it turns(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) out online teaching(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) removes(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) geographical barriers , so we ’re can reach(#after 2020-05-07 10:00:46) out to more participants . ”
Known(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) as “ Pesantran Kilat ” , which loosely translates(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) as “ intensive Islamic boarding school ” , the online Islamic course teaches(#included this year) students about Islam , as well as creative ways to recite(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) the Koran , such as through hand gestures(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) .
The gestures , Indonesian tutor Ahmad Winardi explained(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) , can act(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) as fun prompts to help(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) primary school students , most aged(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) from 6 to 12 years old , recall(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) religious verses .
“ The chemistry is absolutely different as we do n’t meet(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) in person , ” Indonesian tutor Ahmad Winardi said(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) of the online lessons .
“ But we try(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) some ice - breaking activities , such as shouting(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) ‘ God is greatest ’ .
Hopefully The chemistry encourages(#overlap 2020-05-07 10:00:46) some ice - breaking activities to memorise(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) the Koran . ”
Joining(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) the class from Jakarta , Indonesia , alongside classmates from South Sumatra and West Java , Muhammad Umar Abdurrahman , 11 , said(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) Muhammad Umar Abdurrahman , 11 enjoyed(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) the online Islamic course , although Muhammad Umar Abdurrahman , 11 saw(#before 2020-05-07 10:00:46) room for improvement(#included Tuesday) , such as more comprehensive course material .
