On March 14th , Apple officially closed(#included March 14th) every one of its stores outside of China over coronavirus concerns(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) .
But Apple technically stayed(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) open for two days after stayed , just so customers could pick(#Depend-on 2020-03-22 06:45:29) up iPhones or other devices that had been left(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) for repairs(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) , an Apple spokesperson tells(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) Business Insider 's .
Apple tried(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) to contact(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) customers with devices being repaired(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) at Apple Stores via phone and email , an Apple spokesperson said(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) , and many took(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) the chance to pick(#included March 27) up many devices .
Inevitably , either some customers missed(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) Apple attempts(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) , or the two - day pickup window was n't enough time for some customers to make(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) the trip .
Some customers did not pick(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) up their devices within the two - day pickup period , and their devices are still in Apple Stores , an Apple spokesperson said(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) .
For Some customers , Some customers iPhones , Macs , Apples Watches and other devices are essentially stuck(#overlap 2020-03-22 06:45:29) in a closed(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) Apple Store for an undisclosed amount of time .
Apple original timeline to re(#included March 27) Apple stores was Friday , March 27 .
That 's now changed(#included now) to " until further notice(#included now) " as of March 27 .
Unfortunately for those who missed the pickup window , there 's no way for those who missed the pickup window to get(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) those who missed the pickup window devices until Apple Stores re - open , an Apple spokesperson said(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) .
As for those who 's devices were sent out to Apple repair centers , Apple is getting(#overlap 2020-03-22 06:45:29) in touch with those who 's devices were sent out to Apple repair centers to have(#overlap 2020-03-22 06:45:29) those who 's devices were sent out to Apple repair centers devices returned(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) to those who 's devices were sent out to Apple repair centers , rather than the normal route of having(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) those who 's devices were sent out to Apple repair centers shipped(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) to an Apple Store for pickup(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) .
Do you have(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) a device that 's stuck(#before 2020-03-22 06:45:29) indefinitely at an Apple Store during the coronavirus pandemic ?
