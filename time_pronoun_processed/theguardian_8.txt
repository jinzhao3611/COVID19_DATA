However they acknowledge(#included Thursday night) that the scale of the crisis means they do not expect(#overlap 2020-04-03 08:36:44) to have(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) a clear idea of how the crisis might be done until mid - May at the earliest .
As reported(#included Wednesday) by the Guardian before Uefa ’s video conference(#included Wednesday) with national FAs on Wednesday , the football authorities in England and across Europe are increasingly accepting(#overlap 2020-04-03 08:36:44) that starting(#included June) to play again by June is optimistic , a revision(#included June) of the football authorities in England and across Europe initial hope that the 2019 - 20 season could be finished(#included June) by 30 June .

“ Since participation(#overlap 2020-04-03 08:36:44) in Uefa club competitions is determined(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) by the sporting(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) result(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) achieved(#included Thursday) at the end of a full domestic competition , a premature termination(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) would cast(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) doubts about the fulfilment(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) of such condition .
Uefa reserves(#overlap 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the right to assess(#overlap 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the entitlement of clubs to be admitted(#included 2020) to the 2020 - 21 Uefa club competitions , in accordance with the relevant applicable competition regulations . ”
a joint letter sent on Thursday night to Europe ’s 55 national FAs , leagues and top - division clubs was sent(#included Thursday) after the Belgian League management board on Thursday became(#included Thursday) the first in major European football competition to recommend(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) scrapping(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) efforts to finish(#after 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the 2019 - 20 season , saying(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the Belgian League management board will award(#after 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the Belgian League management board championship to Club Brugge who are 15 points ahead of second placed(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) Gent .
The league ’s clubs will now have to seriously think(#included June) about whether to accept(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) scrapping given(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the collective statement of intent by Uefa , the ECA and EL .

The common standpoint(#included Thursday night) struck(#included Thursday night) on 17 March by Uefa , the ECA and EL was that every effort had to be made(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) in order to allow(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) all domestic and European competitions to be concluded(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) in compliance(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) with all domestic and European competitions formats . ”

“ Stopping(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) competitions should really be the last resort after acknowledging(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) that no calendar alternative would allow(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) to conclude(#before 2020-04-03 08:36:44) the 2019 - 20 season . ”
