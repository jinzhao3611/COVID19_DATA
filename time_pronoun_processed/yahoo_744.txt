By Swati Bhat MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Sri Lanka 's central bank said(#included Thursday) on Thursday Swati Bhat MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Sri Lanka 's central bank will immediately adjust(#included Thursday) its bank rate , the emergency funding rate for commercial banks , to 10 % , an effective reduction(#after 2003) of 500 basis points , to align(#after 2003) Swati Bhat MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Sri Lanka 's central bank with falls in key rates since last May.
said underlines(#overlap 2020-04-16 06:01:43) efforts by policymakers globally to provide(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) support to economies hit(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) by the coronavirus crisis .
its bank rate , the emergency funding rate for commercial banks , has been at 15 % since 2003 and this is the first time since then that any adjustment in being made(#after 2003) .
its bank rate , the emergency funding rate for commercial banks , is the emergency(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) rate at which the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) provides(#overlap 2020-04-16 06:01:43) credit to commercial banks against acceptable collateralised(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) assets .
its bank rate , the emergency funding rate for commercial banks , acts(#after 2003) as a penalty(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) rate , which is higher than other market rates and is known(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) as a Lender of Last Resort rate at which emergency loans are provided(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) to banks .
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) cut(#included earlier) the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) Standing Lending Facility Rate ( SLFR ) and Standing Deposit Facility Rate by 25 bps each to 7.00 % and 6.00 % , respectively earlier in April , the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) third cut(#included earlier) in three weeks to tackle(#after last) the coronavirus crisis .
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) has cut(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) the key interest rates five times over the last year , starting(#included last May) with a reduction(#included last May) last May after the Easter bomb attacks(#included last May) that triggered(#included last May) a slump in investment and tourism .
The Monetary Board of the CBSL , at The Monetary Board of the CBSL meeting(#included 2020-04-15) held(#included 2020-04-15) on April 15 decided(#included 2020-04-15) to allow(#included 2020-04-15) its bank rate , the emergency funding rate for commercial banks , to automatically adjust(#included 2020-04-15) in line with The Monetary Board of the CBSL SLFR with a margin of +300 basis points , The Monetary Board of the CBSL said(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) .
" With effect from 16 April 2020 , the Bank Rate , which is an administratively determined(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) rate that could be used(#after 2020-04-16 06:01:43) in periods of emergency(#overlap 2020-04-16 06:01:43) , has been effectively reduced(#after last) by 500 basis points from 15.00 % to 10.00 % , " the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) said(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) .
Analysts said(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) said would help(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) banks access emergency funding at much cheaper rates and is crucial at the current juncture when markets are highly volatile .
Sri Lanka so far has(#overlap 2020-04-16 06:01:43) over 230 confirmed(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) COVID-19 cases , far lower than Sri Lanka neighbours , but Sri Lanka has taken(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) several measures to tackle(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) Sri Lanka impact(#overlap 2020-04-16 06:01:43) on an economy that is highly dependant on tourism for its revenues .
" Given(#overlap 2020-04-16 06:01:43) that the normal CBSL lending rate is 7 % at the moment , a 800 bps margin to its bank rate , the emergency funding rate for commercial banks , seems(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) too wide and makes(#included Thursday) sense to set(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) a 300 bps automatic margin instead , " said(#before 2020-04-16 06:01:43) Thilina Panduwawala , a senior product leader at Frontier Research .
" So now the normal CBSL lending rate will automatically adjust(#after 2020-04-16 06:01:43) with policy rate changes " .
