In Eastern China ’s Suzhou , one of its largest manufacturing hubs , companies have been told(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) to stay(#before Feb. 9) shut(#before Feb. 9) until at least Feb. 8 and in Shanghai until Feb. 9 .

“ The tricky question is whether we will be able to resume(#included Feb. 10) production(#included Feb. 10) ( on Feb. 10) ...
The impact ’s up to the instructions(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) given(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) by central and provincial governments . ”
The Guangdong Department of Labour and Social Security said(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) in a response(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) to a question(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) from Reuters that no company including Foxconn can resume(#included Feb. 10)) work before at least Feb. 10 , with the exception of firms involved(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) in making(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) or providing(#overlap 2020-02-04 09:53:38) medical supplies and other daily necessities .
HEALTH CONTROL
Foxconn has asked(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) employees and clients in China ’s Hubei , the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak , not to return(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) to factories and told(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) workers to report(#overlap 2020-02-04 09:53:38) workers health condition to managers on a daily basis , an internal memo reviewed(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) by Reuters shows(#overlap 2020-02-04 09:53:38) .
Foxconn also said(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) employees who follow(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) the rules will be paid(#after 2020-02-04 09:53:38) as usual and those Foxconn fail(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) to do so will be “ severely ” punished(#after 2020-02-04 09:53:38) , although Foxconn did not elaborate(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) .
A hotline was set(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) up to encourage(#overlap 2020-02-04 09:53:38) employees to report(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) those who had broken(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) the rules , with a monetary award of 200 yuan ( $ 29 ) , the note dated(#included Feb. 1) Feb. 1 said(#included Feb. 1) .
Morningstar analyst Don Yew sees(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) “ limited ” impact on Foxconn ’s supply chain , saying(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) its four subsidiaries in Hubei only accounted(#included 2018) for 1.8 % of Foxconn ’s supply chain ’s overall revenue in 2018 and vendors such as Apple maintain(#overlap 2020-02-04 09:53:38) a diversified supply chain .
However , a spread of the coronavirus to major smartphone manufacturing(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) hubs such as export - oriented Guangdong province may lead(#after 2020-02-04 09:53:38) its four subsidiaries in Hubei to revise(#after 2020-02-04 09:53:38) financial estimates for companies including(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) Foxconn , Morningstar analyst Don Yew said(#before 2020-02-04 09:53:38) .
