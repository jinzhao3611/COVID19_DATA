the first stage of testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 , as it joins a global race to halt the coronavirus pandemic would take(#before late next year) around three months , CSIRO ’s director of health Rob Grenfell told(#before 2020-04-02 06:23:02) Reuters , adding(#before late next year) that any resulting(#before 2020-04-02 06:23:02) vaccine would not be available to the public before late next year .

“ If we can stop(#before 2020-04-02 06:23:02) the coronavirus pandemic binding(#before 2020-04-02 06:23:02) to the ferret receptors in the respiratory system , there ’s a very good chance it ( vaccine ) will work(#before 2020-04-02 06:23:02) in humans , ” CSIRO ’s director of health Rob Grenfell said(#before 2020-04-02 06:23:02) .
