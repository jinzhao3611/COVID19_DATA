WASHINGTON — Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#included Monday) Monday that U.S. likely wo n’t have(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) broad - based testing for the coronavirus in place until September .
“ We 're not going(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) to be there .
We 're not going(#included June) to be there in May , We 're not going(#included the beginning of May.) to be there in June , hopefully We 'll be there by September , ” Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) in an interview(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) on NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) some states that have n’t been hit(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) hard by the coronavirus are ready to begin(#included June) reopening(#included May) slowly in the beginning of May. As other states reopen(#included May) , Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) that U.S. wo n’t have(#overlap 2020-04-20 12:20:41) the optimal amount of testing and contact tracing in place to “ to do the work of tracking down everyone who is sick , or who might have been in contact with people who [ are ] sick . ”
“ It 's a risk , there 's no question It 's a risk , " Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#overlap 2020-04-20 12:20:41) .
" Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb mean(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) , We wo n't have(#included the beginning of May.) the testing that We want(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) until September , Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb think(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) , in terms of kind of broad coverage .
You 're still going(#included June) to see(#included June) high positivity rates heading(#included June) into May. ”
Still , it ’s just not realistic to wait(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) until the fall to reopen(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) , Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) .
“ If We wait(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) until We have(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) sort of the optimal framework for testing(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) , We 'll be waiting(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) until the fall and waiting 's just not going(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) to be possible from an economic , social or public health standpoint , ” Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) .
Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb ’s comments(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) come(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) as some states take(#included 2020-W14) steps to reopen(#included 2020-W14) some states economies this week following(#included 2020-W14) a three - phase plan from the White House recommending(#included the beginning of May.) that governors should do so in stages .
Public health experts , meanwhile , told(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) NBC News that testing(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) for COVID-19 should be at least doubled(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) or tripled(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) from current levels to allow(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) for even a partial reopening(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) of the country ’s economy .
An average of about a million tests(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) are being conducted(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) each week in U.S. , according to the COVID Tracking Project .
That surveillance(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) only covers(#overlap 2020-04-20 12:20:41) diagnostic testing(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) , which determines(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) whether a person tests(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) positive for the illness at the time of testing(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) .
Antibody tests are currently in development(#included currently) that would determine(#included currently) whether a person was previously infected(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) with the illness .
Officials have been saying(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) that Antibody tests could be key to reopening(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) the country ’s economy .
At the same time , officials also warn(#overlap 2020-04-20 12:20:41) that it ’s unclear whether a person who already contracted(#before 2020-04-20 12:20:41) the illness is immune from getting(#after 2020-04-20 12:20:41) the illness again .
