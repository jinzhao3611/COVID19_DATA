Analysis | This Airline Needed(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) More Than Richard Branson’s Magic Touch .
2020-03-05 14:34:12 +00:00 .
But Flybe had(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) problems even before the outbreak(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) .
Flybe was acquired(#included January 2019) in January 2019 for 2.2 million pounds ( $ 2.8 million ) , or a penny a share .
The buyer was Connect Airways , a venture(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) including(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) Branson ’s Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. , and airport operator Stobart Group Ltd. , each with a 30 % stake , as well as private equity firm Cyrus Capital with 40 % .
Together Flybe invested(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) about 110 million pounds .
Flybe was Britain ’s most important carrier(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) for routes outside of London .
But Flybe ’s difficult(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) to turn(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) a profit in the regional aviation market .
Passenger numbers are limited(#overlap 2020-03-05 14:34:12) , and even the smaller planes have(#overlap 2020-03-05 14:34:12) significant fixed costs .
Flybe avoided(#included 2021-01) liquidation(#included 2021-01) in January when Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s government came(#included 2021-01) out in support of state intervention(#included this month) and Flybe owners agreed(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) to inject(#included 2021-01) another 30 million pounds , of which 25 million has been invested(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) .
Flybe was able to defer(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) some taxes , but a vital 100 million - pound loan , cuts(#included this month) to U.K. flight taxes in this month ’s budget and state support for some specific routes were left(#included 2021-01) to further negotiation(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) .
some specific routes could not be agreed(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) upon .
There was a case for state support given(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) Flybe ’s role in connecting(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) more remote corners of the country .
But the government was also probably mindful of the risk in rescuing(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) failing(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) firms .
After all it did n’t step(#included this month) in to save(#included last autumn) the 178 - year - old British tour operator Thomas Cook Group Plc last autumn .
As my colleague Therese Raphael noted(#included 2021-01) in January , there was a danger that even a restructured Flybe would n’t have taken(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) off as even a restructured Flybe owners hoped(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) , creating(#included 2021-01) the need for a more far - reaching rescue(#after 2020-03-05 14:34:12) later on .
Branson ’s Virgin group could also have provided(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) more funding , particularly as the British billionaire ’s net worth has been rocketed(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) because of the increase(#included this month) in the value of suborbital space travel company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. Through Branson ’s Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. , Branson ’s Virgin group has provided(#included this month) about 60 million pounds of Connect Airways ’ funding to Flybe over the past year .
But Flybe now has(#included now) Flybe own problems .
New bookings have fallen(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) between 40 % and 50 % over the last 10 days .
airport operator Stobart Group Ltd. also was n’t in a position to do more , having suspended(#included 2021-01) airport operator Stobart Group Ltd. dividend in November , and pledged(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) to sell(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) off non - core assets .
While the collapse is devastating for Flybe employees , propping(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) up regional routes just is n’t viable with the world mindful of flying(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) ’s environmental impact(#overlap 2020-03-05 14:34:12) .
In the short term , funding would be better used(#after 2020-03-05 14:34:12) to mitigate(#after 2020-03-05 14:34:12) the impact(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) of Flybe demise(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) on workers , and in the longer term , invest(#after 2020-03-05 14:34:12) in alternative transport routes , including(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) rail .
It ’s also worth casting(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) the mind back to the collapse .
Images of stranded(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) tourists raised(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) questions as to why the government did n’t step(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) in there .
But raised now looks(#included now) wise .
If the 178 - year - old British tour operator Thomas Cook Group Plc had received(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) a bailout , with the coronavirus ’s potential hit to tourism in the impending spring and summer travel season , the government would have been facing(#before 2020-03-05 14:34:12) a potentially even bigger headache than that for a regional airline .
