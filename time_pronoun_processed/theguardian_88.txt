Preamble Evening all .
Welcome to our coverage(#included tonight) of tonight â€™s Premier League game(#included tonight) between Norwich City and Leicester at Carrow Road .
It â€™s almost do - or - die for the Canaries with games quickly running(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) out to save(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) the Canaries from the drop(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) as the Canaries prepare(#included tonight) to welcome(#included this weekend) the high - flying Foxes to East Anglia .
Seven points stand(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) between Daniel Farke â€™s side and safety going(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) into this match but you can bet(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) the Canaries supporters will be up for a bit of Friday football under the lights , even with Storm Jorge expected(#included this weekend) to wreak(#included this weekend) havoc(#included this weekend) in the UK this weekend .
Can Norwich City end(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) their five - match wait for a victory(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) just when Norwich City need(#overlap 2020-02-28 19:14:11) their five - match most ?
Meanwhile , Leicester having been licking(#included last week) Leicester wounds after the late defeat(#included last week) to Manchester City last week and will be keen to bounce(#included tonight) back tonight with a victory(#included tonight) .
Leicester still have(#included Sunday) a six point lead over Manchester City in fifth but will know(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) that this is a great opportunity to extend(#after 2020-02-28 19:14:11) that before Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r â€™s side face(#included Sunday) Everton on Sunday .
The last time Jamie Vardy scored(#included 21 December) in Premier League against city on 21 December no one had heard(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) of coronavirus and Jamie Vardy was five goals clear of Jamie Vardy nearest rival in the race for the Golden Boot .
Fast forward 10 weeks and Arsenal â€™s Pierre - Emerick Aubameyang has drawn(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) level on 17 so it â€™s up to Leicester â€™s talisman to hit(#before 2020-02-28 19:14:11) back .
It could be a thriller .
