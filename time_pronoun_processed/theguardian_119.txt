For the first time in Wimbledon history , the championships ’ annual payments(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) to Lawn Tennis Association has scaled(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) £ 50 m as Lawn Tennis Association announced(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) a strong financial standing amid the uncertainty brought(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) by the coronavirus crisis .
Lawn Tennis Association ’s financial statements for 2019 mark(#included 2019) a significant turnaround after three years of planned losses , with 2019 ’s losses(#included 2018) of £ 6.3 m making(#included 2018) way for an operating profit of £ 8.7 m and revenue(#included 2018) of £ 77 m. Much of a significant turnaround after three years of planned losses is a reflection of the greater injection of money from Wimbledon , the championships provided Lawn Tennis Association with 90 % of Lawn Tennis Association distributable surplus , plus additional funding to support grasscourt tournaments and officiating fees .
Its total payments(#included 2018) of £ 52.072 m amounts(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) to 60 % of Lawn Tennis Association ’s total finances .
Wimbledon had been running(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) on a reduced(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) surplus over the past number of years because of the building(#included last year) of the roof over No 1 Court , which was completed(#included last year) last year .
Wimbledon has also invested(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) more heavily in the grasscourt season to offer(#included 2019) Wimbledon warm - up events more security regardless of Wimbledon ’s annual surplus .
As many sporting(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) governing bodies struggle(#overlap 2020-05-20 17:07:09) , Lawn Tennis Association ’s handsome finances means Lawn Tennis Association has(#overlap 2020-05-20 17:07:09) a strong position to support(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) British tennis , underlined(#overlap 2020-05-20 17:07:09) by Lawn Tennis Association now having(#included PRESENT_REF) a total equity of £ 175.8 m and abundant cash reserves of 14.9 m.
However , Lawn Tennis Association opted(#included April) to utilise(#included April) the government ’s furlough scheme on around 50 % of Lawn Tennis Association staff in April , which coincided(#included April) with Lawn Tennis Association announcement(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) of Lawn Tennis Association support fund .
Between 50 to 55 employees are said(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) to be furloughed(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) , with Lawn Tennis Association topping(#included April) up the remaining 20 % of salaries .
Executive staff have also reduced(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) Executive staff pay by 20 % .
The financial impact(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) of Wimbledon cancellation(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) was tempered(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) by Wimbledon pandemic(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) insurance , and the financial outlook(#overlap 2020-05-20 17:07:09) for both Wimbledon and Lawn Tennis Association will be decided(#after 2020-05-20 17:07:09) by the conclusion(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) of the insurance claims process , with Wimbledon surplus expected(#included 2018) to be lower in 2020 .
In addition , despite three fewer employees , Lawn Tennis Association also announced(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) a significant £ 2.7 m rise(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) in salary expenditure(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) .
“ Whilst Lawn Tennis Association delivered(#included 2018) a profit for 2019 , the current outlook for 2020 and beyond will be very different due to the financial impact of the current pandemic(#included PRESENT_REF) , ” read(#before 2020-05-20 17:07:09) a statement from the governing(#overlap 2020-05-20 17:07:09) body .
