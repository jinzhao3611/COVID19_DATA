Netflix is delivering(#included 2020-04-24) the most trouble - free streaming service amid the jump in video streaming(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) during the coronavirus crisis(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) , according to a new study .
Netflix users reported(#included 2020-04-24) just 0.07 technical problems per hour of content streamed(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) on average , according to a J.D. Power April 24 - 26 survey of U.S. streaming users .
That ’s meaningfully lower than problem incidents(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) reported(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) for Amazon Prime Video and Hulu ( 0.11 ) , Disney Plus ( 0.12 ) and YouTube TV ( 0.13 ) .
Technical problem rates were even higher among all other streaming services , at 0.17 per hour streamed(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) .
To be sure , the error rates are very low across all streaming(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) services in a new study .
But in the streaming wars(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) , even the tiniest incremental differences can have(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) big ramifications in retaining(#overlap 2020-05-23 12:59:00) subscribers .
With its high rates of content engagement(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) and low technical problems , Netflix is the No . 1 service consumers said(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) consumers would keep(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) in response(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) to the hypothetical question of which service consumers would pick(#after 2020-05-23 12:59:00) if consumers could keep(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) only one .
About 54 % of respondent said(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) About 54 % of respondent would choose(#after 2020-05-23 12:59:00) Netflix , followed(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) by Amazon Prime Video ( 17 % ) , Hulu ( 13 % ) and Disney Plus ( 4 % ) , per a new study .
( A caveat :
a new study did not poll(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) users about price . )
“ There is no question that the great content is critical for streaming service success , but the quality of audio and video … is the key differentiator(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) for top - performing streaming providers , ” Ian Greenblatt , managing director of J.D. Power ’s technology , media and telecom practice , wrote(#included 2020-04-24) in a new study .

That said(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) , Netflix — like any other always - on service — occasionally hits(#overlap 2020-05-23 12:59:00) technical turbulence .
Most recently , on March 25 , Netflix ’s web - based streaming service experienced(#included March 25) an hour - long outage(#included March 25) across the U.S. and Europe .
Note , too , that a new study was U.S.-only , and some Netflix customers in the U.K. and Europe have complained(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) that J.D. Power has continued(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) to throttle(#overlap 2020-05-23 12:59:00) back video bit rates ( a program designed(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) to cut(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) back data usage during the coronavirus pandemic ) .
Overall , though , Netflix outperforms(#included recently) rivals on reliability , something J.D. Power attributed(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) in part to Netflix longstanding hybrid content delivery network ( CDN ) strategy .
Under Netflix ’s Open Connect program , first introduced(#included 2012) in 2012 , Netflix has(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) agreements(#included April 2020) with internet service providers around the world to co(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) streaming servers to localize(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) “ substantial amounts ” of traffic as close as possible to end users .
a new study is based(#included April 2020) on a survey of 1,232 U.S. adults conducted(#included April 2020) April 24 - 26 , 2020 .
About 67 % of streaming video users say(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) About 67 % of streaming video users are spending(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) “ somewhat ” or “ substantially ” more time streaming(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) than About 67 % of streaming video users did before COVID-19 lockdowns(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) , a new study found(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) .
That ’s borne(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) out by data from Nielsen , which says(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) streaming(#before 2020-05-23 12:59:00) to TVs continues(#overlap 2020-05-23 12:59:00) at elevated levels .
For the week of May 11 - 17 , U.S. broadband households streamed(#included 2020-04-24) 141.7 billion minutes of video to televisions — up 75 % from the comparable period in 2019 .
Netflix represented(#included recently) 32 % of total streaming(#included recently) minutes for the most recent period , followed(#included recently) by YouTube TV at 21 % .
