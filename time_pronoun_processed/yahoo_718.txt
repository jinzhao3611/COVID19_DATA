“ President Donald Trump am standing(#before 2020-04-20 00:32:21) up for the men and women who have done such a great job , not me , ” he claimed .
" If the men and women who have done such a great job , not me , ” he claimed did n't do what the men and women who have done such a great job , not me , ” he claimed did ... more than 40,000 Americans could be a million . "
