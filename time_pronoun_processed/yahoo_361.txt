An American woman feared to have potentially spread COVID-19 to other passengers aboard Holland America Line ’s Westerdam cruise ship does not seem(#overlap 2020-02-24 19:06:55) to have(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) the novel coronavirus after all , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) confirmed(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) .
The false - positive is only the latest development(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) in the the Westerdam Cruise Ship saga .
After rumors spread(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) that a passenger on board the Westerdam Cruise Ship had(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) coronavirus , An American woman feared to have potentially spread COVID-19 to other passengers aboard Holland America Line ’s Westerdam cruise ship was denied(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) entry(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) at ports in five different countries — even as Holland America Line ’s Westerdam cruise ship maintained(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) that nobody on board was sick(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) with COVID-19 .
Passengers celebrated(#included mid - February) when some were finally allowed(#included mid - February) to disembark(#included mid - February) in Cambodia in mid - February .
The tone changed(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) dramatically , however , when news spread(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) that an 83 - year - old American woman — whom the cruise line said(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) showed(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) no signs of illness while on board — had tested(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) positive for COVID-19 in Malaysia after disembarking(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) from the Westerdam Cruise Ship .
an 83 - year - old American woman — whom the cruise line diagnosis(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) stoked(#included mid - February) fears that other people who had been aboard An American woman feared to have potentially spread COVID-19 to other passengers aboard Holland America Line ’s Westerdam cruise ship — many of whom disembarked(#included mid - February) in Cambodia and then continued(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) on to other destinations — may have unknowingly acted(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) as carriers for the novel coronavirus , potentially contributing(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) to the novel coronavirus spread worldwide .
After news broke(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) , passengers still on the ship were told(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) to stay(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) on board , and passengers still on the ship were directed(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) not to leave(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) Cambodia .
Later testing(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) on an 83 - year - old American woman — whom the cruise line , however , came(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) back negative for COVID-19 .
While CDC has not tested(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) an 83 - year - old American woman — whom the cruise line directly , a spokesperson confirmed(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) to TIME that after the patient ’s initial positive result(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) , two subsequent tests(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) came(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) back negative .

It ’s not entirely clear why an 83 - year - old American woman — whom the cruise line initially tested(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) positive for COVID-19 , though CDC officials have said(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) an 83 - year - old American woman — whom the cruise line may have had(#before 2020-02-24 19:06:55) another respiratory illness .
