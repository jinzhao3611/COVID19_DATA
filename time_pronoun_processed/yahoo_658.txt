The COVID-19 crisis(#included Tuesday) has decimated(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) travel demand , with unprecedented flight(#included the quarter) cancellations(#included March 31) in the second half of March , forcing(#included Tuesday) airlines to preserve(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) and raise(#overlap 2020-04-28 13:59:36) cash .
Southwest swung(#included March 31) to a net loss of $ 94 million for the quarter ended March 31 , compared to a profit of $ 387 million a year earlier .

Total operating revenue(#included Tuesday) fell(#included Tuesday) 17.8 % to $ 4.2 billion .
Southwest sees(#included April) operating revenue falling(#included April) by 90 - 95 % in both April and May , when Southwest does not expect(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) load factors to surpass(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) 10 % .
While Southwest has(#included April) more bookings for June and July - albeit in a drastically reduced(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) flight(#included April) schedule - Southwest said(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Southwest can not reasonably estimate(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) any revenue trends beyond May.
" Southwest have no idea what kind of cancellations will come(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) through before those travel(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) dates ; there 's no way to be comfortable with what will happen(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) to those reservations , " Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Reuters .

Airlines including(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Southwest support pre - boarding temperature checks , face masks and social distancing(#overlap 2020-04-28 13:59:36) measures(#overlap 2020-04-28 13:59:36) on airplanes and in airports .
" Southwest do think(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) there 's a role for the federal government to play(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) here and as an industry Southwest 'll be advocating(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) for 's , " Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) .
Southwest average daily cash burn(#included April) will slow(#included April) to between $ 30 million and $ 35 million in the second quarter , due to a series of cost - cutting measures(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) and capital raisings , including(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) government aid , Southwest said(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) .
Southwest is receiving(#overlap 2020-04-28 13:59:36) about $ 3.3 billion in government payroll support and said(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Southwest was considering(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) tapping(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) an additional $ 2.8 billion in secured government loans under the stimulus(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) package known(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) as the CARES Act , among other liquidity options .
Southwest had(#included April 24) $ 9.3 billion in cash and short - term investments(#included April) as of April 24 , with leverage of 47 % .
Under the terms of government payroll support , airlines can not lay(#before Sept. 30) off employees before March 31 .
If demand remains(#overlap 2020-04-28 13:59:36) weak , Southwest has said(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Southwest may need(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) to reduce(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Southwest workforce after that date and rethink(#after 2020-04-28 13:59:36) its fleet .
Southwest said(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) Southwest has reached(#before 2020-04-28 13:59:36) an agreement(#before Sept. 30) with Boeing to take(#before Sept. 30) no more than 48 new the grounded 737 MAX jets until Dec. 2021 , a fraction of the 123 Southwest had originally scheduled(#included the second quarter) .
