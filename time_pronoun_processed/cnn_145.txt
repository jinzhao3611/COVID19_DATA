New York / Hong Kong ( CNN Business ) Russia and Saudi Arabia have struck(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic .
Members of OPEC and Members of OPEC allies , including(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) Russia and Mexico ,

they had been seeking(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) to cut(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) production(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) in order to buoy(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) oil prices , which fell(#included recent weeks) to 18 - year lows in recent weeks .
fell came(#included early March) after Saudi Arabia and Russia abandoned(#included early March) years of production(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) cuts(#included early March) in early March , launching(#included early March) a price war(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) by flooding(#included early March) a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic with crude .
the coronavirus pandemic , meanwhile , dealt(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) a devastating blow to energy demand , pushing(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) prices even lower .
announced comes(#included Sunday) after OPEC+ tried(#included Sunday) to reach(#included Sunday) an agreement Thursday to cut 10 million barrels a day , but Mexico would not sign(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) onto an agreement Thursday to cut 10 million barrels a day .
On Friday , though , Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said(#included Sunday) Mexico would cut(#after 2020-04-13 07:27:58) Mexico output by 100,000 barrels per day .
While 100,000 barrels per day was far less than what was proposed(#included Sunday) at Thursday meeting(#included Sunday) , Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador added(#included Sunday) that US President Donald Trump offered(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) to cut(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) US production by 250,000 barrels per day to compensate(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) for Mexico .
The United States is not an OPEC+ member .
At a news conference(#included Sunday) Friday , US President Donald Trump confirmed(#included Sunday) US President Donald Trump spoke(#included Sunday) to US President Donald Trump and agreed(#included May) to a cut , though US President Donald Trump did not confirm(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) the exact size .

" US production 's a small amount for us , a large amount for Mexico , " US President Donald Trump said(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) .
" US production will save(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in The United States , " US President Donald Trump said(#included 2020-04-03) in said .
Oil futures were initially muted after news of a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic broke(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) , though advanced during Asian trading(#included early March) hours .
Brent , the global benchmark , was last(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) up more than 4 % to $ 32.78 a barrel .
US oil prices moved(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) nearly 5 % higher to $ 23.85 a barrel .
Even so , the decline in output amounts(#included April) to only about 10 % of the world 's normal supply of oil , far below the estimates for how much demand for oil has collapsed(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) amid the coronavirus pandemic .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs called(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic " historic yet insufficient , " adding(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) that cut were " still too little and too late to avoid(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) breaching(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) storage capacity . "
" Ultimately , the decline in output simply reflects(#overlap 2020-04-13 07:27:58) that no voluntary cuts(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) could be large enough " to offset(#included April) the loss(#included April) in demand , which they pegged(#included April) at 19 million barrels per day on average in April and May. Jeffrey Halley , senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda , called(#included 2020-04-03) a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic " underwhelming , ' and noted that non - OPEC+ oil producers , including The United States , Canada and Norway , have not committed on paper to " actual cuts to production . "
" a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic , although well - meaning in intent , wholeheartedly fail(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) to address(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) the supply / demand basis confronting(#overlap 2020-04-13 07:27:58) the world 's , " Jeffrey Halley , senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda , added(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) .
" a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic can at best only put(#before 2020-04-13 07:27:58) a floor under oil prices at oil prices March lows .
