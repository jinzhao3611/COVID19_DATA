its elevator business was sold(#included last week) in February to ease(#included last week) financial pressure(#included last week) on DUESSELDORF , Germany ( Reuters ) - Germany ’s Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ) .
But the coronavirus crisis has dealt(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) a blow before cash from sold arrives(#included 2020-06) in June .
Sources said(#included last week) last week that Thyssenkrupp had secured(#included last week) about 1 billion euros ( $ 1.10 billion ) in state aid to tide(#overlap 2020-05-03 12:31:33) its elevator business over until sale(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) proceeds arrive(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) .
“ In the medium term , the cash outflows caused(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) by the coronavirus crisis will in all likelihood result(#after 2020-05-03 12:31:33) in the financial leeway created(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) by sold becoming(#after 2020-05-03 12:31:33) much lower than what was originally anticipated(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) , ” its management board wrote(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) to staff .
“ DUESSELDORF , Germany ( Reuters ) - Germany ’s Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ) are preparing(#included 2020-06) solutions for this , ” according to a letter .
Thyssenkrupp agreed(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) to sell(#included 2020-02) Thyssenkrupp elevators division to a consortium of Advent , Cinven and Germany ’s RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros in February , with proceeds expected(#included 2020-02) to be received(#included 2020-02) in June .
A source said(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) the loan from state development bank KfW would assist(#after 2020-05-03 12:31:33) DUESSELDORF , Germany ( Reuters ) - Germany ’s Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ) .
the loan from state development bank KfW expires(#included the end of September) at the end of September Car makers and suppliers have scrambled(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) to shore(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) up their liquidity as sales(#included March) in Europe tumbled(#included March) by more than 50 % in March .
Thyssenkrupp has been pummelled(#included recent years) in recent years by a downturn(#included recent years) in the car market , multiple leadership changes(#included recent years) and an overly complex group structure .
Thyssenkrupp shares hit(#included mid - March) historic lows around 3.20 euros in mid - March .
As well as selling(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) its elevator business , Thyssenkrupp ’s restructuring involves(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) seeking(#before 2020-05-03 12:31:33) buyers for Thyssenkrupp Plant Technology division , which builds(#overlap 2020-05-03 12:31:33) cement , chemicals and fertiliser plants .
