( Bloomberg ) --
Exxon posted(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) Exxon first loss in at least 32 years while Chevron deepened(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) spending cuts(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) amid the economic and industrial devastation(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) wrought(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) by the Covid-19 contagion(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
The worst may be yet to come(#after 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
Exxon reported(#included 2020-04-03) a $ 610 million loss(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday , the oil giant ’s first since at least 1988 , and said(#included 2020-04-03) Exxon ’s shutting(#included March 31) hundreds of thousands of barrels of daily output .
Meanwhile , Chevron slashed(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) capital spending for the second time in five weeks and accelerated(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) supply curbs .
The results are precursors(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) of even starker figures to come(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) because the earnings period ended(#included March 31) on March 31 -- three weeks before crude prices tumbled(#included March 31) into negative territory for the first time in history .
Exxon fell(#included 9:45 a.m.) 1.8 % to $ 45.63 at 9:45 a.m. in New York trading .
Chevron dropped(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) 2.3 % .
Oil producers are slashing(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) spending and production(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) to cope(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) with the collapse in energy demand that ’s accompanied coronavirus lockdowns around the world .
the collapse in energy demand that ’s accompanied coronavirus lockdowns around the world has destroyed(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) billions of dollars in value , sidelined(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) entire drilling programs , erased(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) thousands of jobs and sent(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) some drillers into bankruptcy(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
Almost $ 3 billion in writedowns(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) bit into Exxon ’s first - quarter results(#included March 31) , driving(#included March 31) a per - share loss(#included March 31) of 14 cents that was far worse than analysts anticipated(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
Oil and natural gas output rose(#included 2020-04-03) 2 % during the earnings period .
Despite the collapse in energy demand that ’s accompanied coronavirus lockdowns around the world , Exxon maintained(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) Exxon long - standing optimism about future demand growth(#after 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
“ Economic activity will return(#after 2020-05-01 14:15:24) , and populations and standards of living will increase(#after 2020-05-01 14:15:24) , which will in turn drive(#after 2020-05-01 14:15:24) demand for Exxon products and a recovery of the industry , ” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said(#included 2020-04-03) in the statement(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods stuck(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) to the $ 10 billion in spending cuts(#included April 7) announced(#included April 7) on April 7 .
As for Chevron , full - year spending was cut(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) as much as 13 % from the previous plan , the world ’s No . 3 oil explorer by market value said(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) in a statement(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) .
Chevron also will shut(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) down as much as 400,000 barrels of daily output and retire(#after 2020-05-01 14:15:24) 60 % of the drilling rigs Chevron has under lease .
The measures(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) come(#included April 7) just weeks after Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth first took(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) drastic steps to conserve(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) cash and slow output .
Chevron ’s first - quarter net income rose(#included first - quarter) to $ 1.93 a share , adjusted(#included April 7) for one - time gains(#included 1980s) and losses(#included a year earlier) , from $ 1.39 a year earlier .
Oil CEOs are facing(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) choices Chevron ’s never confronted(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) before because worldwide oil demand is forecast(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) to slump(#included 1980s) by more than twice the annual declines(#included 1980s) seen(#included 1980s) during the worst days of the 1980s recession(#included 1980s) .
Chevron ’s worldwide production(#included a year earlier) rose(#included a year earlier) 6 % compared(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) with a year earlier to the equivalent of 3.24 million barrels a day , a record for any quarter .
What BloombergNEF Says(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24)
Production shut - ins alone will not balance(#Depend-on 2020-05-01 14:15:24) the oil market .
While shut - ins would remove(#before 2020-05-01 14:15:24) some barrels from the oil market , the oil market will remain(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) extremely over - supplied as travel bans eat(#overlap 2020-05-01 14:15:24) into demand .
