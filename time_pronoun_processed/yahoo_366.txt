What ’s got(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon so excited(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) ?
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon believes(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) that recent gains(#included recent) made(#included recent) by NVDA stock — NVDA stock ’s up 37 % in the past three months — are based(#included recent) on the company ’s fundamental strengths and not the industry ’s general momentum .
The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ( NASDAQ : SMH ) has(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) a total return(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) of 15.4 % over the past three months .
“ With NVDA stock almost exactly back to prior peak levels , it is obvious that not growing(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) more constructive .
Sooner , was an error(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) , ” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) in Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon note to clients .
“ Overall though , we believe(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) , potential forthcoming product cycles , resumption(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) of hyperscale [ cloud computing ] spending , and potential near - term catalysts , NVDA stock has(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) the potential to continue(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) upward from here , even after the solid run . ”
You know(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) what they say(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) , “ an object at rest stays(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) at rest , while an object in motion stays(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) in motion . ”
Despite the potential of the coronavirus to hit(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) stocks like Nvidia that do a lot of business in China , investors are buying(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) NVDA based(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) on the bigger picture , ignoring(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) any near - term issues that might affect(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) sales(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) and profits .
How long can this last(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) ?
Reading(#included recent) some recent articles about artificial intelligence suggests(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) NVDA has(#included recent) a significant runway of growth(#included recent) ahead of NVDA .
Is it enough to take(#before the end of 2020) NVDA to $ 400 before the end of 2020 ?
Based(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) on NVDA current valuation , I doubt(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) NVDA .
But then , when has valuation ever been a concern(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) to investors feasting(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) on the longest bull market in history ?
InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer recently discussed(#included recently) the impact AI is having(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) on Nvidia ’s stock price .
Specifically , InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer highlighted(#included Wednesday) the fact that Nvidia ’s data center business saw(#included the fourth quarter) revenues jump by 33 % on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter .
InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer believes(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) that AI , unlike the cryptocurrency craze of a couple of years ago , is the real deal .
On that point , we agree(#included recently) .
Nvidia spent(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) a great deal of time emphasizing(#included a couple of years ago) Nvidia ’s AI success stories in its Q4 2019 press release .
“ Alibaba ’s and Baidu ’s recommendation engines run(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) on AI , boosting(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) inference(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) by orders of magnitude beyond CPUs , ” its Q4 2019 press release stated(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) .
As if run was n’t enough , CEO and founder Jenson Huang said(#included Wednesday) , “ We are well positioned(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) for the greatest technology trends of We time . ”
With that kind of hyperbole , how can it miss(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) hitting(#included recently) $ 400 by the end of 2020 ?
In all seriousness , CEO and founder Jenson Huang ’m bullish on Nvidia ’s future , and CEO and founder Jenson Huang have been for some time .

Ten years from now , you ’ll be delighted(#after 2020-02-23 14:55:47) with the results .
And while paying(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) almost 18 times sales for the privilege might seem excessive(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) , you will pay(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) 10 times sales(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) for Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ : AMD ) , which has less than one - tenth the free cash flow .
Do n’t get(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) CEO and founder Jenson Huang wrong , CEO and founder Jenson Huang like(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ : AMD ) , which has less than one - tenth the free cash flow , but if CEO and founder Jenson Huang could only choose(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) one , you ’ll continue(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) to go(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) with Nvidia because of Nvidia cash flow generation .
After Alibaba ’s 74 % gain(#included 2019) in 2019 , CEO and founder Jenson Huang felt(#before 2020-02-23 14:55:47) that while Alibaba ’s might beat(#included 2019) the market in 2020 , Alibaba ’s would deliver(#included 2019) more modest gains(#after 2020-02-23 14:55:47) to shareholders .
Up 24 % year to date , Alibaba ’s push into AI looks(#overlap 2020-02-23 14:55:47) like Alibaba ’s ’s going(#after 2020-02-23 14:55:47) to pay(#after 2020-02-23 14:55:47) dividends for years to come(#after 2020-02-23 14:55:47) .
