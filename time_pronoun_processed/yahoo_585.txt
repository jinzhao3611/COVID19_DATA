UK must “ get(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) to grips ” with coronavirus deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) in care homes with fatalities(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) continuing(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) to rise(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) as those in hospital fall(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) , the deputy chief scientific adviser has said(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) .
Angela McLean shared(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) latest figures revealing(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) that the death rate in care homes had grown(#included April 24) to about half the level of that in hospitals by the week ending April 24 .
And care home deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) continued(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) to rise(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) as hospital deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) fell(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) , accounting for an increasing(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) proportion of Covid-19 fatalities(#included evening) in UK .
Angela McLean told(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) the daily Downing Street briefing : “ Whilst deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) in hospitals have been falling(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) , deaths(#included the week) in care homes in the week ending April 24 were still rising(#included that week) to the extent that in the week ending April 24 deaths(#included April 24) in care homes were about half as many as the deaths(#included that week) in all hospitals .
“ Angela McLean think(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) what that shows(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) us is that there is a real issue that we need(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) to get(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) to grips with about what is happening(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) in care homes . ”
More than a fifth of all coronavirus - related deaths(#included that week) in England and Wales up to April 24 happened(#included that week) in care homes .
Figures from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) show(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) that the deaths of 5,890 care home residents after they had contracted Covid-19 had been registered(#included April 24) by April 24 .
the deaths of 5,890 care home residents after they had contracted Covid-19 represents(#included 2020) around 21 % of the 27,356 coronavirus - related deaths(#included 2020) registered(#included 2020) up to that date so far this year .
( Some 29,710 people had actually died(#included 2020) as of April 24 , taking(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) into account registrations that took(#included 2020) place into May. )
Around seven out of 10 deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) involving(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) Covid-19 happened(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) in hospital , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) , with 19,643 hospital deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) registered(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) .
There were 1,306 deaths(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) in private homes and 301 in hospices .
Meanwhile , Angela McLean said(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) Angela McLean was “ troubled(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) ” by the latest social distancing data which showed(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) the number of motor journeys(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) was “ creeping(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) up ” .
“ It does trouble(#overlap 2020-05-06 07:28:16) Angela McLean , ” Angela McLean told(#before 2020-05-06 07:28:16) the daily Downing Street briefing .
