Trump preparing(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to unveil(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) second coronavirus task force, officials say(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
2020-04-09 16:01:10 +00:00 .
Meadows is likely to lead(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the task force , though no official decision has been made(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) , two senior administration officials said(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
Kevin Hassett , Trump ’s former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , may also join(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the Council of Economic Advisers , another official said(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
two senior administration officials spoke(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) on the condition of anonymity to discuss(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) internal deliberations(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
the task force , despite having(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) some overlapping(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) members — will focus(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) on how to reopen(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the country , as well as what businesses need(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to rebound(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) amid catastrophic conditions .
The goal is to get(#included April 30) as much of the country as possible open by April 30 , the current deadline Trump set(#included April 30) for stringent social distancing measures .
the task force will not meet(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) every day , like the large one , and is expected(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to have(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) a more informal feel , with many of the meetings held(#included earlier this week) over the phone and as in - person briefings(#included April 30) with Trump .
An announcement(#included earlier this week) could come(#included earlier this week) as early as this week , although within the West Wing , there were previous plans to announce(#included earlier this week) the task force earlier this week — and those were delayed(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
The White House declined(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to specifically comment(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) on the task force .
“ Trump ’s policies took(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) this economy to record(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) setting(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) historic highs for all Americans but this unforeseen , unprecedented crisis(#included last month) has hurt(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) many workers and businesses , ” said(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) The White House spokesman Judd Deere .
“ Trump wants(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to see(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) this economy open again so people can get(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) back to work(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) , but scientific data will drive(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the timeline on those decisions(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) because Trump number one priority is to protect(#overlap 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the safety and well - being of all Americans . ”
the task force adds(#included recently) yet another layer to an already unwieldy bureaucratic coronavirus response(#overlap 2020-04-09 16:01:10) process within The White House ; after becoming(#included last month) involved(#included last month) in the task force last month , Jared Kushner — Trump ’s son - in - law and senior adviser — has also formed(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) Trump own working(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) group , which some dismissively refer to as a shadow task force .
The idea of a group dealing(#overlap 2020-04-09 16:01:10) solely with the economic impact of the virus has recently been under consideration(#included recently) .
After initially announcing(#included April 12 this year) an Easter deadline — which falls(#included April 12 this year) on April 12 this year — to reopen(#included April 12 this year) the country , Trump reluctantly pushed(#included April 12 this year) the time frame back to April 30 , amid strong urging(#included April 12 this year) by public health officials .
But Trump has remained(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) fixated(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) on reopening(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) this economy and has publicly mused(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) about a second task force focused(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) on this goal .
On Saturday , Trump shared(#included Saturday) a tweet by Fox News host Dana Perino , in which Fox News host Dana Perino suggested(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) a supplemental economic task force .
“ Trump think(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) we need(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) a 2nd task force assembled(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) at direction of POTUS to look(#included recently) ahead to reopening(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) of this economy , ” Fox News host Dana Perino wrote(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
“ Made(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) up of a nonpartisan / bipartisan mix of experts across industry sectors , so that we have(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) a nonpartisan / bipartisan mix of experts across industry sectors recommendations plan(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) — let(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the task force focus(#after 2020-04-09 16:01:10) on crisis(#included recently) at the moment . ”
Asked(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) later at that day ’s briefing(#included that) whether he was , in fact , planning(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to go(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) forward with a second task force , Trump replied that Trump was considering(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) a second task force .
“ Thinking(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) about a second task force , ” Trump said(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) .
“ Getting(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) a group of people .
And we have to open(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the country .
You know , Trump had(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) an expression : ‘ The cure ca n’t be worse than the problem itself . ’
Right ?
Trump started(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) by saying(#included Saturday) that , and Trump continue(#overlap 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to say(#overlap 2020-04-09 16:01:10) it :
The cure can not be worse than the problem itself . ”
Trump concluded(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) : “ We ’ve got(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) to get(#before 2020-04-09 16:01:10) the country open . ”
