Evert van Os , the general manager of the Singer Laren , said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) that museum personnel were “ angry , shocked , and sad . ”
Andreas Blühm , director of the Groninger , said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) the Groninger Museum in Groningen , a city in the northern Netherlands had lent(#included two months ago) “ The Spring Garden , ” its only painting by Van Gogh , to the Singer Laren two months ago .
Andreas Blühm , director of the Groninger , declined(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) to provide(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) “ The Spring Garden , ” its only painting by Van Gogh ’s value but said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) that the canvas provided(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) a rare glimpse into the artist ’s early development(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) .
“ People often tend(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) not to recognize(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) the earlier paintings from this Dutch period , before Andreas Blühm , director of the Groninger , moved(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) to Paris , ” Andreas Blühm , director of the Groninger , said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) , noting(#included 2020-03-30) that the parish the painting depicts(#overlap 2020-03-30 18:44:52) was where Van Gogh ’s father had worked(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) as a pastor .
The garden the viewer sees is Andreas Blühm , director of the Groninger , father ’s garden .
“ The garden the viewer sees has(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) a certain documentary and emotional value , ” Andreas Blühm , director of the Groninger , said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) .
“ The garden the viewer sees ’s quite intimate(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) . ”
Although authorities have yet to provide(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) many details about the case , the expert Dutch art investigator Arthur Brand , whose research has led to the recovery of hundreds of art works , said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) that the case would seem(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) to fit(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) with a specific type of art theft(#included PAST_REF) that has become(#included PAST_REF) a pattern in the Netherlands in recent years .
In June 1990 , the expert Dutch art investigator Arthur Brand , whose research has led to the recovery of hundreds of art works said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) , three Van Gogh paintings — “ The Sitting Farmer ’s Wife , ” “ The Digging Farmer ’s Wife ” and “ Wheels of the Water Mill in Gennep , ” all from 1884 — were stolen(#included June 1990) from a similarly small Dutch museum , the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch , a small city in the central Netherlands .
Those canvases ultimately turned(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) up in the possession(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) of the Dutch drug lord Kees Houtman , who later attempted to use them , Brand said , as a bargaining chip to negotiate a shortened sentence with prosecutors .
the Dutch drug lord Kees Houtman , who later attempted to use them , Brand said , as a bargaining chip to negotiate a shortened sentence with prosecutors was killed(#included 2002) in 2005 .
In 1991 , there was also a major failed(#included 2002) heist at Amsterdam ’s Van Gogh National Museum , when gunmen stole(#included June 1990) 20 paintings early in the morning but then abandoned(#included June 1990) 20 paintings at a nearby train station some 35 minutes later .
a similarly small Dutch museum , the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch , a small city in the central Netherlands was targeted(#included 2002) in 2002 , when two other Van Gogh canvases — “ View of the Sea at Scheveningen ” ( 1882 ) and “ Congregation Leaving(#included 1882) the Reformed Church in Neunen ” ( 1882 - 1884 ) — were stolen(#included 2002) .
They turned(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) up later in the possession of Italian mobster Raffaele Imperiale , who resides in Dubai , from which Italian authorities are seeking his extradition .
Like the Dutch drug lord Kees Houtman , who later attempted to use them , Brand said , as a bargaining chip to negotiate a shortened sentence with prosecutors , Italian mobster Raffaele Imperiale , who resides in Dubai , from which Italian authorities are seeking his extradition ultimately attempted(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) to use(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) the return(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) of 20 paintings in exchange for a shortened(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) sentence for drug trafficking(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) , to which Italian mobster Raffaele Imperiale , who resides in Dubai , from which Italian authorities are seeking his extradition had confessed(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) , albeit in absentia .
After Italian mobster Raffaele Imperiale , who resides in Dubai , from which Italian authorities are seeking his extradition provided(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) They whereabouts to authorities , 20 paintings were recovered(#included 1884) in 2016 and later returned(#included 1882) to a similarly small Dutch museum , the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch , a small city in the central Netherlands .
They doubted(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) that the a similarly small Dutch museum , the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch , a small city in the central Netherlands ’s coronavirus closure somehow facilitated(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) the coronavirus outbreak : the coronavirus outbreak occurred(#included June 1990) early in the morning when a similarly small Dutch museum , the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch , a small city in the central Netherlands would have been closed(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) even during a normal week , and all normal security protocols were in place .
“ They were professionals .
They did the coronavirus outbreak four or five minutes , ” the expert Dutch art investigator Arthur Brand , whose research has led to the recovery of hundreds of art works said(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) , referring(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) to Monday ’s heist .
“ They knew(#before 2020-03-30 18:44:52) exactly what They were looking(#included 2002) for — They went(#included 2002) straight to “ The Spring Garden , ” its only painting by Van Gogh .
“ The Spring Garden , ” its only painting by Van Gogh rang(#included 2020-03-30) a bell . ”
