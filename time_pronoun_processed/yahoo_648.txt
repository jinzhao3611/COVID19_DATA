Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) Airbus is aiming(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) to survive(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) without state support but that its customers and supplier base need(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) as much help as its customers and supplier base can get(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) .
“ the “ gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known is really unprecedented , ” Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#included Wednesday) on a call .
“ the “ gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known ’s hitting(#included Tuesday) all regions of the globe and all industries at the same time so the role of governments is obviously key .
One of the major risks for us is suppliers going(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) bust . ”
Airbus customer British Airways said(#included Tuesday) Tuesday Airbus customer British Airways will cut(#included Tuesday) as many as 12,000 jobs , or close to 30 % of the total , to help(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) survive(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) a downturn(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) in travel(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) that could last(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) for years , while Deutsche Lufthansa AG is locked(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) in talks(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) with the German government over a multibillion - euro bailout and could seek court protection if Deutsche Lufthansa AG ca n’t reach a deal .

Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) measures(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) taken(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) by Airbus so far , which include(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) cutting(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) annual production(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) by slightly over one - third and temporarily laying(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) off more than 6,000 workers , may be just the start , and Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury will review(#included June) the situation in June when there may be more visibility into the direction the “ gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known is headed(#included June) .
Airbus is looking(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) to furlough(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) staff in the German government , and will put(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) more French workers on leave(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) .
“ The resizing(#included June) of Airbus will be made(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) not only looking(#included PAST_REF) at the minus 35 % adaptation(#included PAST_REF) we ’ve done recently but also the likely scenario moving(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) forward , ” Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) .
Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) the cash outflow was worse than the 6.3 billion euros we ’ve predicted(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) and leaves(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) Airbus with just 3.6 billion euros in net cash .
Airbus said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) Airbus has reduced(#included this year) anticipated(#included this year) capital spending(#included this year) this year by about 700 million euros to ease(#included June) demands on Airbus sources .
Airbus had already extended(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) credit lines and clamped(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) down on expenses to give(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) Airbus access to 30 billion euros .
While Airbus delivered(#included the first quarter) 122 aircraft in the first quarter , the full impact(#included the first quarter) of the coronavirus was n’t initially felt(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) , Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) , though 60 planes could n’t be handed(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) over because of the coronavirus outbreak .
Deliveries in the second quarter “ will be very low , ” Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) .
Airbus plans(#included this year) to ship(#included this year) about 600 jets this year based(#included June) on Airbus reduced(#included June) build(#included this year) rates , down from a record 863 in 2019 , though the tally may be cut(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) further .
Suppliers will feel(#included this year) a squeeze in the second quarter when cash payments(#included this year) drop , and will then need(#after 2020-04-29 07:57:38) support , Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) , especially since many are already under pressure after the idling of the Max reduced(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) revenue from arch - rival Boeing Co. .
First - quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell(#included the first quarter) 49 % to 281 million euros and arch - rival Boeing Co. swung(#included the first quarter) to a net loss .
Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said(#before 2020-04-29 07:57:38) arch - rival Boeing Co. is still assessing(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) the implications of Covid-19 and ca n’t yet provide(#overlap 2020-04-29 07:57:38) a financial outlook for this year .
