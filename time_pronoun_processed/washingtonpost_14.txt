For weeks , Washington and California defined(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the outbreak(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) .
The spread of the virus at a nursing home in Washington led(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) to dozens of deaths(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) , pushing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) early mortality figures upward .
California took(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) strong measures to halt(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the spread of the virus earlier than other places , including(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) issuing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) a shelter - in - place order for a number of counties near San Francisco before such orders(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) were commonplace .
But a surge in New York quickly pushed(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the total number of confirmed(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) cases in New York past both Washington and California .
The number of cases in New York , most of them in New York , quickly dwarfed(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the case totals in Washington and California .
There have been more confirmed(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) cases in New York than anywhere in the world except China , Italy and Spain .
( It ’s likely that China is underreporting(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) China case totals , as are countries such as Iran . )
If we adjust(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) those figures for population , California ’s trend stands(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) out .
Over the weekend , Santa Clara County , once a potential hotspot of coronavirus infections , announced(#included the weekend) that Santa Clara County , once a potential hotspot of coronavirus infections had gone(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) a day without any covid-19 - related deaths(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) .
What ’s interesting to consider(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) is how the three states diverged(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) .
California consistently saw(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) slower growth(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) than New York or Washington relative to the point at which each state passed the 1 - case - per-1 - million - residents mark .
the three states saw(#included the first week) increases(#included the first week) at about the same rate for the first week after passing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the point at which each state passed the 1 - case - per-1 - million - residents mark — but then diverged(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) .
Why ?
The New York Times explored(#included 2020-04-05) Washington ’s success Sunday .
While California introduced(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) restrictions(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) on large groups and travel(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) later than New York or Washington relative to the spread each state had seen(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) , state officials drew(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) attention to the problem relatively quickly and made(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) recommendations for preventing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the virus ’s spread soon after the first death(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) in California .
One thing Washington did do was begin(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) testing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) broadly more quickly .
Until less than two weeks ago , Washington was conducting(#before 2020-03-30) more tests(#before 2020-03-30) each day than New York , according to data compiled(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) by the COVID Tracking Project .
As a function of population , Washington was completing(#included recently) more tests per million residents than New York as recently as a week ago .
Twelve days after each state passed(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the 1 - case - per-1 - million - residents mark , Washington was completing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) 1.7 times as many tests per resident as New York .
These numbers only tell(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) part of the story .
New York ’s numbers are also a function of the density of the population in New York .
Statewide testing(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) numbers do n’t explain(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) how focused testing can guide(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) efforts to limit(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the spread of the virus .
Case confirmation(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) totals , meanwhile , depend(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) on the number of tests(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) conducted(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) , meaning(#included 2020-04-05) that all of these figures carry(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) an asterisk of uncertainty .
The implications of those differences are significant(#included 2020-04-05) .
As of Monday , New Yorkers with the virus might be cared(#after 2020-03-30 19:44:17) for at the New York convention center or in pop - up tents in Central Park .
Those in medical distress(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) unrelated to coronavirus might end(#Depend-on 2020-03-30 19:44:17) up being cared(#after 2020-03-30 19:44:17) for on a naval hospital ship in New York , part of an effort to reduce(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) strain(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) on the city ’s hospitals .
One bit of good news did emerge(#included Monday) on Monday , though : emergency room visits are trending(#overlap 2020-03-30 19:44:17) downward , suggesting(#included Monday) that the measures(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) to curb(#included 10 days ago) new infections put(#included 10 days ago) into place 10 days ago may be having(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) the desired effect .
But the number of cases in California is n’t expected(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) to peak(#before 2020-03-30 19:44:17) for several weeks .
