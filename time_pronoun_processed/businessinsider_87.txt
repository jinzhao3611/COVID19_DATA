A cruise expert describes(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the biggest mistake(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) Princess Cruises made(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) in handling the coronavirus outbreak that infected over 700 people on the Diamond Princess .

The captain on the Diamond Princess was n't assertive enough in taking(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) steps to prevent(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the coronavirus from spreading(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) on the Diamond Princess , according to cruise - industry expert Ross Klein .
The captain on the Diamond Princess had(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the ability to segregate(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) crew members who may have been ill from those who were n't ill or to find(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) ways of ensuring(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) that crew members who potentially were ill were not eating(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) at the same crew mess as the people who were n't ill , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) of The captain on the Diamond Princess .

Before canceling(#included May 10) all of Business Insider 's cruises(#included May 10) through May 10 , Princess Cruises received(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) criticism(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) for its handling of a coronavirus outbreak on its Diamond Princess ship that eventually infected over 700 passengers and crew members .
The biggest mistake(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) made(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) by Princess Cruises came(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) from those running(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the Diamond Princess , like The captain on the Diamond Princess , said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) Ross Klein , a professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland who studies(#overlap 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the cruise industry and runs(#overlap 2020-03-13 15:30:06) a website documenting(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) illness outbreaks(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) on cruise ships .
The captain on the Diamond Princess was n't proactive(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) enough in taking(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) steps to protect(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) passengers and crew members , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) , leaning(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) instead on the Japanese government , which imposed(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) a quarantine(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) over three days after learning(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) that a prior passenger on the ship had tested(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) positive for the coronavirus .
a prior passenger on the ship had(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the ability to segregate(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) crew members who may have been ill from those who were n't ill or to find(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) ways of ensuring(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) that crew members who potentially were ill were not eating(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) at the same crew mess as the people who were n't ill , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) of The captain on the Diamond Princess .
Princess Cruises did not immediately respond(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) to a request(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) for comment(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) .
Being more decisive may not have stopped(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the coronavirus from spreading(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) on the Diamond Princess , but Being could have at least slowed(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the coronavirus down , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) .
While Princess Cruises mishandled(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the Diamond Princess , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) Princess Cruises did make(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) a smart decision by canceling(#before May 11) all of its cruises until May 10 .
" cruise - industry expert Ross Klein think(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) canceling was a very wise move(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) .
" cruise - industry expert Ross Klein think(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) it 's unfortunate that it took(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) all of its cruises this long and that the remainder of the companies within Carnival Corp. and others have n't seen(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) the value in taking(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) that kind of an approach .
"Ultimately , Princess Cruises is n't likely to suffer(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) long - term reputational damage from its handling of a coronavirus outbreak on its Diamond Princess ship that eventually infected over 700 passengers and crew members , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) , pointing(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) to Holland America Line , which recovered(#included 2002."Within) after multiple norovirus outbreaks(#included 2002."Within) in 2002."Within a year , people pretty much forgot(#before 2020-03-13 15:30:06) , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said .
