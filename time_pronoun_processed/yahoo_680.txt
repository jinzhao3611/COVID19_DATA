( Reuters ) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday pointed(#included Friday) to research(#included Friday) showing(#included Friday) that strains of Coronavirus entered(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) New York from Europe , not China , and said(#included Friday) that travel bans(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) enacted(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) by U.S. President Donald Trump were too late to halt(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) its spread .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo cited(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) research from Northeastern University estimating(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) that more than 10,000 New Yorkers may have contracted(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) its spread by the time New York had(#included March 1) New York first confirmed(#included March 1) case on March 1 .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#included Friday) New York Governor Andrew Cuomo believed(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) Italy was the likely source .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo noted(#included Friday) that U.S. President Donald Trump ordered(#included Feb. 2) a ban(#included Feb. 2) on travel(#included the following month) from China on Feb. 2 , more than a month after news reports(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) had emerged(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) about an outbreak in the city of Wuhan , and decided(#included March 1) to restrict(#included the following month) travel(#included the following month) from Europe the following(#included the following month) month .
By that time , its spread had spread(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) widely in the United States , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) .
" We closed(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) the front door with the China travel ban , which was right , " New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) a briefing(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) . "
But We left(#included Friday) the front door open because its spread had left(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) China by the time We did the China travel ban , which was right . "
With New York Governor Andrew Cuomo comments(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo thrust(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) New York Governor Andrew Cuomo into a heated and politically fraught debate(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) about when and how its spread first entered(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) the United States and whether officials like Trump and himself could have saved(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) more lives if officials like Trump and himself had acted(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) sooner .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo defended(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) New York Governor Andrew Cuomo own actions by pointing(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) to the 19 days between New York 's first confirmed case and his lockdown order , arguing(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had moved(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) faster than any other state .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) U.S. President Donald Trump was right to question(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) whether the World Health Organization responded(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) properly to its spread .
But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo took(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) aim at what New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) as a slow reaction(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) by China leaders , even as increasingly disturbing reports emerged(#included 2020-01) out of China in January and February about how quickly its spread was spreading(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) and killing(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) people .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) as many as 2.2 million people took(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) flights(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) from Europe to New York and New York airports in the 19 days between New York 's first confirmed case and his lockdown order , many of as many as 2.2 million people likely carrying(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) the highly contagious respiratory illness COVID-19 .
" We acted(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) two months after an outbreak in the city of Wuhan .
When you look(#included 2020-01) back , does anyone think(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) its spread was still in China waiting(#included the following month) for We to act(#included the following month) two months later ?
" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) .
" The horse had already left(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) the barn by the time We moved(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) . "
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) it was important that China learns(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) from the mistakes(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) that were made(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) because its spread could surge(#included autumn) again in autumn or a new virus could emerge(#after 2020-04-25 06:11:22) .
" surge will happen(#after 2020-04-25 06:11:22) again .
Bank on surge .
Let 's not put(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) 's head in the sand , " New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) it was too early to reopen(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) New York .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) the three - day rolling average for people newly admitted(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) for COVID-19 was holding(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) stubbornly around 1,300 per day , a worrisome sign .
But on a positive note , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said(#before 2020-04-25 06:11:22) hospitalizations for COVID-19 totaled(#included Thursday) 14,258 on Thursday , declining(#included Thursday) for the tenth straight day .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reported(#after March 31) 422 additional deaths(#after March 31) , the lowest daily total since March 31 .
