Coronavirus pandemic may have started(#included October,) as early as October , according to a new joint study of its genetic make - up by researchers at University College London and the University of Reunion Island .
The pathogen wreaking havoc on the world , known scientifically as SARS - CoV-2 , is thought(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) to have made(#included October 6) the jump from The pathogen wreaking havoc on the world , known scientifically as SARS - CoV-2 initial host to humans at some point between October 6 and December 11 .
a new joint study of its genetic make - up by researchers at University College London and the University of Reunion Island will be published(#after January) in a forthcoming edition of scientific journal Infection Genetics and Evolution .
Researchers studied(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) the evolution(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) of the mutations since the mutations jumped(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) to humans in order to work(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) back the mutations molecular clocks to a common starting point .
Separately , Chinese government information , seen(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) previously by the South China Morning Post , suggests(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) one of the first patients to emerge(#included November 17) was a 55 - year - old resident of Hubei province on November 17 .
" Patient zero " has not yet been confirmed(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) .
The theory the virus was circulating(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) earlier than had been thought(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) came(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) after a French athlete who fell ill after competing in Wuhan in October said(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) a French athlete who fell ill after competing in Wuhan in October had been told(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) by doctors it was likely that a French athlete who fell ill after competing in Wuhan in October had caught(#included October 18) Covid-19 .
The claim by Olympic silver - winning pentathlete Elodie Clouvel bolstered(#included November 17) theories that coronavirus may have been carried(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) around the world by people who had taken(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) part in an international competition in the Chinese city .
Ms Clouvel , 31 , said(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) that she and her 27 - year - old boyfriend Valentin Belaud , also a pentathlete , had fallen(#included October 18) ill after the Military World Games , held in Wuhan between October 18 and 27 and featuring 9,308 athletes from 109 countries .
Other French team members have since spoken(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) to the French press , mainly on condition of anonymity , to say(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) Other French team members too had become(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) sick .
" she and her 27 - year - old boyfriend Valentin Belaud , also a pentathlete fell(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) ill with the same symptoms , " Ms Clouvel , 31 , , told(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) RTL radio .
" she and her 27 - year - old boyfriend Valentin Belaud , also a pentathlete have recently had(#included recently) a contact with the military doctor , who said to us : ' I think you had [ it ] because there were a lot of people who were ill afterwards ' . "
The French army denies(#overlap 2020-05-08 23:49:43) knowledge of anyone contracting(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) the disease during the Military World Games , held in Wuhan between October 18 and 27 and featuring 9,308 athletes from 109 countries .
This week , French doctors informed(#included This week) a 43 - year old man that a " mystery " disease a 43 - year old man contracted(#included This week) on December 27 , which left(#included This week) a 43 - year old man requiring(#included November 17) oxygen , was Covid-19 after testing(#included October 18) a frozen swab .
Until then , the first confirmed(#included January 24) case in France was on January 24 .
The discovery(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) of France potential " patient zero " prompted(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) the World Health Organisation to urge(#before 2020-05-08 23:49:43) other countries to investigate(#after 2020-05-08 23:49:43) any other early suspicious cases .
