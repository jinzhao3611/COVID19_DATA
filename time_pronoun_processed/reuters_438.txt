“ The onus is on private creditors to act(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) , ” said(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty .
A group of 138 economists from 20 countries , including Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Edmund S. Phelps , argue(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) in the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty that Argentina ’s top spending priority is to protect(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) Argentina citizens from the health and economic fallout caused(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) by the coronavirus crisis rather than pay(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) back creditors who knew(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) they were taking(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a big risk by buying(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) high - yielding Argentine paper .
Argentina is out to revamp(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) about $ 65 billion in “ unsustainable ” international bonds .
But some major holders have balked(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) at Argentina ’s proposal to impose big cuts in coupon payments , a three - year payment hiatus and a push back of maturities into the next decade .
Bondholders have until Friday to respond(#before Friday) .
Argentina ’s proposal to impose big cuts in coupon payments , a three - year payment hiatus and a push back of maturities into the next decade is part(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) of a broad debt restructuring with creditors , including(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) the International Monetary Fund and Paris Club of country - to - country lenders .
Argentina was already in recession(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) before going(#included March 20) on lockdown(#included March 20) against the pandemic(#included March 20) on March 20 .
Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman worked(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) with Joseph Stiglitz at Columbia University in New York before returning(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) to Argentina to manage(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) the restructuring of bonds issued(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) by Argentina ’s previous government .
“ Argentina has presented(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a responsible offer to creditors that reflects(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) Argentina ’s capacity to pay(#after 2020-05-06 18:57:20) , ” the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty said(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) .
If Argentina fails(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) to clinch(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a deal Argentina could risk(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a painful default(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) , with a grace period to pay(#included 2019-05-22) around $ 500 million on three separate dollar bonds set(#included 2019-05-22) to expire(#included 2019-05-22) on May 22 .
The prospect of securing(#included Friday) an agreement(#included Friday) by Friday darkened(#included Friday) after a trio of major creditor groups rejected(#included Friday) Argentina ’s offer , and Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman acknowledged(#included Wednesday) that reaching(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a consensus had “ proven(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) difficult . ”
the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty pointed(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) out that creditors knew(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) creditors were making(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a risky investment when creditors bought(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) Argentine paper , which is why Argentina was paying(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) higher than normal interest rates .
On the other hand , Ted Pincus , a managing director at Mangart Capital Advisors , said(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) the rates that Argentina had been paying(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) were not high for a country with Argentina poor credit history .
A default this month would be Argentina ’s ninth .
The most recent non(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) - payment stemmed(#included 2019-05-22) from a 2002 financial meltdown that tossed(#included 2002) millions of middle - class Argentines into poverty .
“ The sustainability of debt depends(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) on government policy and credibility , ” Ted Pincus , a managing director at Mangart Capital Advisors , said(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) .
the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty says(#included Wednesday) both Argentina and its creditors would benefit(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) from negotiating(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) a sustainable debt revamp(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) deal as the coronavirus crisis pummels(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) global economic activity and the ability of governments to pay(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) governments debts .
“ Pressure on public finances has become(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) enormous , particularly in developing(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) countries that were already highly indebted(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) , ” the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty says(#included Wednesday) .
Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman tweeted(#included Wednesday) that Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman appreciated(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) the economists ’ support .
“ Argentina remains(#overlap 2020-05-06 18:57:20) optimistic that Argentina can reach(#after 2020-05-06 18:57:20) an agreement(#after 2020-05-06 18:57:20) with its creditors that can restore(#after 2020-05-06 18:57:20) the sustainability of Argentina debt and make(#after 2020-05-06 18:57:20) economic recovery after Covid-19 possible , ” the open letter signed by Nobel Prize winners Stiglitz and Phelps along with other well - known experts , including Jeffrey Sachs , Carmen Reinhart and Thomas Piketty said(#before 2020-05-06 18:57:20) .
