WASHINGTON — Planners for the Democratic National Convention are looking(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) at “ contingency options ” in case the mid - July gathering in Milwaukee ca n’t take(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) place because of the coronavirus , officials said(#included Monday) on Monday for the first time .
“ As we navigate(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) the unprecedented challenge(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) of responding(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) to the coronavirus , we ’re exploring(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) a range of contingency options to ensure(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) we can deliver(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public health , ” said(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) Katie Peters , a convention(#included mid - July) spokeswoman .
“ This is a very fluid situation — and the Democratic National Convention is still more than three months away .
we ’re are committed(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) to sharing(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) updates(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) with the public in the coming(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 21:34:17) weeks and months as we ’re plans continue(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) to take(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) shape . ”
One person with knowledge of the discussions(#included Monday) said(#included Monday) Monday that “ intensive scenario - planning ” was taking(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) place among officials from the Democratic National Committee , the convention committee and the Milwaukee host committee , who were all determining(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) what to do about the Democratic National Convention .
Among the complicating(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) factors are the uncertain nature of the professional basketball season — the Democratic National Convention is home to the Milwaukee Bucks , a top N.B.A. team likely to play(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) deep into the playoffs if the league ’s season were to restart(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) — and how the party ’s delegates will be selected .
Delegates in most states are elected(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) to the Democratic National Convention from state conventions(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) , but many state conventions , scheduled(#included late spring) for late spring and early summer , are also being postponed(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) .
Convention planning(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) is also hamstrung(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) by the fact that as long as Senator Bernie Sanders remains(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) in the race , Democrats do not yet have(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) a de facto presidential nominee .
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who has an all but insurmountable delegate lead , can not take(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) the reins of the convention(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) process until either Senator Bernie Sanders concedes(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) or Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who has an all but insurmountable delegate lead , reaches a 1,991 - delegate threshold .
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who has an all but insurmountable delegate lead , can not accumulate(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) more delegates until more states hold(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) more states nominating(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) contests(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) .
With many states postponing(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) many states primaries , it would be impossible for Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who has an all but insurmountable delegate lead , to reach(#before June) 1,991 delegates before June , even if Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who has an all but insurmountable delegate lead , won(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) all of the delegates in each of the upcoming(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) primaries and caucuses(#included late spring) .
A memo sent Friday from the leaders of the D.N.C. ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee said(#included Monday) 18 states and Democrats Abroad had proposed(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) changing(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) delegate selection plans previously submitted(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) to and approved(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) by D.N.C.
The proposed(#Depend-on 2020-03-23 21:34:17) changes articulated(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) in A memo sent Friday from the leaders of the D.N.C. ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee include(#included late spring) moving(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) dates of state party conventions where national convention delegates are selected(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) , modifying(#included Monday) state party rules that govern(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) the delegate selection(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) process to allow(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) proxy voting(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) , and allowing(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) “ other methods in the steps to select(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) national convention delegates while implementing(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) social distancing(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) in their state . ”
Democratic officials said(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) no major corporate donors had rescinded(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) financial pledges to the Democratic National Convention , but one person involved(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) in fund - raising for the Democratic National Convention described(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) the convention ’s fund - raising status as “ frozen . ”
Another person involved(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) in planning(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) the Democratic National Convention said(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) there was still time to make(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) key decisions and emphasized(#before 2020-03-23 21:34:17) that the Democratic National Convention would have(#after 2020-03-23 21:34:17) some flexibility because members of the Lasry family , which owns(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) Milwaukee and controls(#overlap 2020-03-23 21:34:17) the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee , are significant Democratic Party donors .
