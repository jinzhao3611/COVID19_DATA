Vital international climate talks due to be hosted by the UK are expected(#Depend-on 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to be delayed(#before late next year) until late next year because of the coronavirus crisis , delayed has emerged(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) , dashing(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) hopes Vital international climate talks due to be hosted by the UK could be reconvened(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) sooner .
The UN talks , known as Cop26 , were to be held(#included early April) in Glasgow this November , but in early April The UN talks , known as Cop26 , were postponed(#included this November) as governments around the world grappled(#included early April) with lockdown(#included early April) .
At that time governments thought(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) the summit could be reconvened(#included this November) within the first three months of 2021 .
However , at a follow(#included 28 May) - up UN meeting(#included 28 May) on 28 May the UK will try(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to persuade(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) other countries and UN that a much longer delay(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) is necessary and talks(#included November 2021) should be moved(#included November 2021) to the first half of November 2021 , the Guardian has learned(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) .
moved leaves(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) a hiatus of a whole year , although interim meetings might be staged(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to try(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to regain(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) some momentum for the crunch(#Depend-on 2020-05-26 19:31:51) negotiations .
Governments are supposed(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to prepare(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) detailed plans before Cop26 on how to cut(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) Governments greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement , which most have so far failed(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to do .
Current pledges on emissions cuts(#included November 2021) , made(#included November 2021) in 2015 , would take(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) the world to an estimated(#included 2021) 3C of heating above pre - industrial levels , far beyond the 2C limit set(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) in the Paris agreement .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the world ’s leading(#Depend-on 2020-05-26 19:31:51) body on climate science , has warned(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) that the world must change(#included November 2021) course drastically by 2030 , making(#included 28 May) this year ’s deadline for revised national plans even more urgent .
Experts told(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) the Guardian Experts were concerned(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) that a long gap before Cop26 would make(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) it harder to gain(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) the momentum needed(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to force(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) reluctant countries to come(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) up with new national plans on emissions cuts(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) .
A short delay(#included 28 May) to next spring was seen(#included 28 May) as a boon(#included 28 May) by some , as the US presidential election(#included 28 May) takes(#included 28 May) place this November .
A spring conference(#included 28 May) would either have welcomed(#included 28 May) a new administration , or have given(#included 28 May) time for other countries to react(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to the reelection(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) of Donald Trump , who is withdrawing(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) the US from the Paris agreement .
But the UK is understood(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to believe(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) that travel restrictions(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) would impede(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) any large - scale conference(#included this November) earlier in this year .
With 196 nations expected(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to take(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) part in Cop26 , even if lockdowns were eased(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) in many countries it is likely restrictions(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) would still be in place in some parts of the world well into next spring .
Holding(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) a virtual conference has been considered(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) , but many civil society groups are wary , as many civil society groups say(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) activists in and around Vital international climate talks due to be hosted by the UK play(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) a vital role in pressing(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) ministers to go(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) further .
Another concern(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) is that separate UN environmental talks(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) , on biodiversity , are being rescheduled(#included spring) to the first half of November 2021 , and it is thought(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) better to retain(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) the original sequence , with the biodiversity conference(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) preceding(#included 2015) Vital international climate talks due to be hosted by the UK .
Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) sharply as a result of lockdowns(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) , with a 17 % drop in daily emissions levels recorded(#included this November) by early April , according to recent research(#included spring) .
Many experts are calling(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) for a “ green recovery ” from the coronavirus crisis , with an Oxford study showing(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) that backing(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) green projects would create(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) jobs and provide(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) a greater return on investment than pouring(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) public money into business as usual .
If Cop26 is delayed(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) by a full year , those recovery plans(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) – green or not – will be well under way before global governments are next required(#after 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to account(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) publicly for global governments stewardship of the climate .
Commenting(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) on revised national plans , Chris Venables , the head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank , said(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) : “ The really important thing now is to make(#overlap 2020-05-26 19:31:51) sure the recovery from the coronavirus crisis is linked(#before 2020-05-26 19:31:51) to climate change ambition and Cop26 .
the recovery from the coronavirus crisis has to be a green recovery . ”
