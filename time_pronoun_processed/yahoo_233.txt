Will Glastonbury be cancelled(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) because of coronavirus? .
2020-03-17 07:52:28 +00:00 .
Glastonbury ’s the musical highlight of the British summer , and widely regarded(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) as one of the best festivals(#overlap 2020-03-17 07:52:28) in the world — but will Glastonbury still go(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) ahead amid all the coronavirus chaos ?
The Worthy Farm festival revealed(#included last week) the first big chunk of its humongous line - up last week , with Kendrick Lamar confirmed(#included last week) as the third and final headliner , alongside Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney .
And the rest of its humongous line - up last week was pretty spectacular(#included last week) , too — with FKA Twigs , Gilberto Gil , Charli XCX , Aitch , Kano , Nubya Garcia , Robyn and Thundercat just a few of the names set(#included summer) to make(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) their way to Somerset .
However , in the face of all the uncertainty enveloping(#included right now) the music industry right now — many major gigs and festivals have been postponed(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) in both the UK and beyond — fans are wondering(#included right now) whether Glastonbury can still feasibly(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) run(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) .
“ As things stand(#included right now) we are still working(#included June) hard to deliver(#included June) The Worthy Farm festival in June , ” said(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) Glastonbury ’s co - organiser Emily Eavis when unveiling(#included last week) the line - up last week .
“ we are very proud of its humongous line - up last week . ”
“ No one has(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) a crystal ball to see(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) exactly where we will all be 15 weeks from now , but we are keeping(#overlap 2020-03-17 07:52:28) we fingers firmly crossed that it will be here at Worthy Farm for the greatest show on earth . ”
So , as far as the organisers are concerned(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) , Glasto is still going(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) to happen(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) .
But is Glasto likely ?
Professor Chris Whitty , England ’s chief medical officer , said(#included March 12) on March 12 that Professor Chris Whitty , England ’s chief medical officer , expects(#included summer) the UK to reach(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) the peak of its coronavirus outbreak in about 10 to 14 weeks from that point .
reach means the height of its coronavirus outbreak should occur(#included over the last year or so) roughly between May 21 and June 18 , with the number of new cases then set(#included June) to reduce(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) .
Glastonbury is due(#included June) to run(#included over the last year or so) from June 24 until June 28 .
Glastonbury means the margins are still very tight(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) — and even if the country has passed(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) the peak of its coronavirus outbreak by then , it still remains(#overlap 2020-03-17 07:52:28) very uncertain as to whether a festival(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) as massive as Glastonbury could be properly planned(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) and run(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) with all that ’s gone(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) before Glastonbury .
The answer , then , as to whether Glasto will happen(#after 2020-03-17 07:52:28) is a very strong maybe .
As with much else in these times , we can only wait(#included summer) and see(#before 2020-03-17 07:52:28) .
