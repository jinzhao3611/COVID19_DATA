Under the Phase One plan for relaxing mandatory business closures imposed at the start of the month , Governor Ron DeSantis said(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) retail merchants and restaurants could welcome(#included Monday) customers back inside retail merchants and restaurants establishments starting(#included Monday) Monday , but admissions(#included Monday) will be limited(#after 2020-04-29 22:26:18) to 25 % of capacity .
Eateries may also reopen(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) outdoor seating with appropriate social distancing , and medical practices can resume(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) elective surgeries and procedures(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) , Governor Ron DeSantis said(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) at a news conference(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) .
But movie theaters , bars and fitness clubs will remain(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) shuttered(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) for the time being , Governor Ron DeSantis said(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) .
the Phase One plan for relaxing mandatory business closures imposed at the start of the month also leaves(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) existing(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) restrictions in place for all commercial establishments in the densely populated South Florida metropolitan region consisting(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) of Miami - Dade , Broward and Palm Beach counties .
Florida has(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) a high proportion of elderly residents , who are especially vulnerable to the U.S. coronavirus outbreak , and waited(#before early) until early April to clamp(#before early) down on commerce(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) - after most other states had already done so .
But Florida has avoided(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) the worst of the health crisis(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) seen(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) in other states such as New York and New Jersey .
Still , Florida becomes(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) the most populous of about a dozen states forging(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) ahead with economic reopenings despite a lack of wide - scale virus testing(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) and the means to trace(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) close contacts of newly infected individuals , as recommended(#included April 16) by White House guidelines on April 16 .
“ Part of our strategy in Phase One is to expand(#after 2020-04-29 22:26:18) testing , ” Governor Ron DeSantis said(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) , adding(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) that Florida would increase(#after 2020-04-29 22:26:18) walk - up virus screening(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) sites to 11 throughout Florida .
“ our want(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) to be able to spot(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) trends in the under - served communities . ”
With millions of Americans out of jobs since stay - at - home orders(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) were imposed(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) across Florida , pressure has been mounting(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) on governors to ease(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) restrictions(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) .
Public health experts have urged(#overlap 2020-04-29 22:26:18) caution , saying that a rollback of social distancing without large - scale virus testing(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) or the means to trace(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) close contacts(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) of infected individuals could trigger(#before 2020-04-29 22:26:18) a second wave of infections .
U.S. deaths(#included Wednesday) from the novel coronavirus topped(#included Wednesday) 60,000 on Wednesday and the U.S. coronavirus outbreak will soon be deadlier than any flu season since 1967 , according to a Reuters tally .
