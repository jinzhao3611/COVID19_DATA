“ Later on , I knew(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) everything about Marina Abramovic’s Maria Callas Opera , ” I said(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) .
“ I read(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) eight biographies , eight biographies , and there was so much similarity that I see(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) in I .
We are Sagittarius , the same ; We had(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) bad mothers .
And then , also , this incredible intensity in the emotions , that Marina Abramovic’s Maria Callas Opera can be fragile , and strong at the same time . ”
For “ 7 Deaths of Marina Abramovic’s Maria Callas Opera , ” I selected(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) the arias , beginning(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) with “ Addio del passato ” from “ La Traviata ” and reaching(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) a climax with “ Casta Diva ” from “ Norma , ” to reflect(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) those emotional states , and I worked with the music video director Nabil Elderkin to develop the short films , which play onstage while the singers perform live .
Last November , I flew(#included Last November) to Los Angeles to record(#included the early 2000s) the short films , which play onstage while the singers perform live with Mr. Dafoe .
In an interview(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) , Mr. Dafoe said(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) Mr. Dafoe had gotten(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) to know I when Mr. Dafoe was acting(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) with the Wooster Group , the experimental New York theater company .
In the early 2000s , I was living(#included the early 2000s) in a co - op in the same downtown building as the theater , and I would come(#after 2020-04-13 10:59:32) to see(#after 2020-04-13 10:59:32) a co - op in the same downtown building as the theater shows .
The two became(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) friends and later collaborated(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) on “ The Life and Death of I , ” a stage work by the avant - garde director Robert Wilson .
In six of the short films , which play onstage while the singers perform live , Mr. Dafoe plays(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) I ’s lover or assassin ; in all of them , I dies(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) .
In one , Mr. Dafoe handles(#included the early 2000s) a python that strangles(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) I , to the strains of the “ Ave Maria ” Desdemona sings(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) shortly before being throttled(#included the early 2000s) by the title character in Verdi ’s “ Otello . ”
“ I ’ve known(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) I for years , and I like(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) being part of I work , ” Mr. Dafoe said(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) .
“ If I wants(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) Mr. Dafoe to kill(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) I , well , that ’s quite an honor . ”
In another video , Mr. Dafoe stabs(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) I to the Habanera from “ Carmen . ”
Susan McClary , a professor of musicology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , said(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) in an interview(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) that Bizet ’s opera had established(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) the trope of Marina Abramovic’s Maria Callas Opera .
Women had died(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) in opera from the art form ’s beginnings , Susan McClary , a professor of musicology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , said(#before 2020-04-13 10:59:32) , but the audience did n’t see(#before the 19th century) opera from the art form ’s beginnings until the 19th century .
