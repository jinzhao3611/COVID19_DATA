Apple's growth(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) stalls(#overlap 2020-04-30 21:28:21) as Apple's deals(#overlap 2020-04-30 21:28:21) with COVID-19's impact(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) .
2020-04-30 21:28:21 +00:00 .
Apple's released(#included this afternoon) Apple's quarterly earnings this afternoon for the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak began(#included this afternoon) to reshape(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) lives and economies , and the results are unsurprisingly mixed(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) .
Apple's saw(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) slumps in hardware sales(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) almost across the board , but Apple's reported(#included last year) a total of $ 58.3 billion in revenue -- just edging(#included last year) out Apple's performance this time last year .
“ Despite COVID-19 ’s unprecedented global impact(#included the) , we ’re proud to report(#included the) that Apple's grew(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) for the quarter , ” CEO Tim Cook said(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) in a statement(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) .
Today ’s results did n’t come(#included Today) out of the blue .
Earlier this year , Apple's confirmed(#included Earlier this year) to Apple's shareholders that Apple's would not meet(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) Apple's previous revenue guidance of between $ 63 billion and $ 67 billion because of a “ slower return(#included Earlier this year) to normal conditions ” than Apple's had anticipated(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) .
CEO Tim Cook noted(#included today) Today that , before the coronavirus had begun(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) to reach(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) massive proportions , Apple's was expecting(#included this past quarter) a highly successful quarter with revenue near the top of Apple's guidance(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) .
In this past quarter , Apple's has continued(#included this past quarter) with Apple's work as best as possible and pushed(#included this past quarter) forward with new product releases , including updated versions of the iPad Pro and MacBook Air .
new product releases , including updated versions of the iPad Pro and MacBook Air were released(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) too late to have(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) a significant impact on the results , though .
Despite raking(#included Earlier this year) in $ 4.37 billion from its iPad business and $ 5.35 billion off Mac sales(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) , Apple's still fell(#included Earlier this year) short of the watermark Apple's set(#included last year) this time last year .
Since Apple's accounts(#included the) for the majority of its iPad business , it 's little surprise its iPad business took(#included Earlier this year) the brunt of the damage -- sales fell(#included last year) from $ 31 billion in the year - ago quarter to $ 28.9 billion this time .
Apple's did n't elaborate(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) on the cause of this dramatic dip in its initial release , but soft sales(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) in China and coronavirus - related production(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) delays(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) likely contributed(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) to the situation .
Despite these sales(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) slumps , Apple's did report(#included this past quarter) a few successes in the year - ago quarter .
Apple's services business -- which has quickly become(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) one of Apple's most crucial growth(#included this past quarter) areas -- made(#included Earlier this year) all - time high $ 13.3 billion .
Sales in Apple's Wearables , Home and Accessories category surged(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) slightly , too , generating(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) $ 6.3 billion for Apple's .
For now at least , Apple's seems(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) to be holding(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) everything together quite well , but there 's one important thing to remember(#overlap 2020-04-30 21:28:21) : This is the last quarter on the books that was n't completely influenced(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) by the COVID-19 outbreak .
( Apple 's Q2 started(#included the beginning of January 2020) at the beginning of January 2020 , before the coronavirus situation began(#included the beginning of January 2020) to spiral(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) . )
As a result , the big changes we 've all had to grapple(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) with will be more fully reflected(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) in its initial release .
For instance , Apple's closed(#included March 13th) all of Apple's stores outside Greater China on March 13th , two weeks before the end of Apple 's Q2 .
The effects of closed will likely have(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) a huge impact on Apple's next batch of financials , as will the new iPhone SE , which seems(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) well - positioned to help(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) Apple's gain(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) ground with value - minded consumers .
For now , we 'll have to see(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) how things play(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) out ; Apple's will certainly face(#overlap 2020-04-30 21:28:21) questions about the future of Apple's supply chains , production capability and new hardware development(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) during Apple's customary earnings(#before 2020-04-30 21:28:21) call(#included this quarter) , and we ’re update(#after 2020-04-30 21:28:21) this story with any notable tidbits .
