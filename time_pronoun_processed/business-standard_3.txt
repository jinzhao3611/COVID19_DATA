Italy donated(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) PPE to China; now China wants(#included PRESENT_REF) Italy to buy(#included PRESENT_REF) back PPE .
2020-04-05 09:55:06 +00:00 .
At the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in China , Italy had donated(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Personal Protection Equipment ( PPE ) to China and now when Italy is in dire need of PPE , China wants(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to sell(#after 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Personal Protection Equipment ( PPE ) to Italy , according to a report(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) in the Spectator magazine .
The China - originated bug , which crossed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) continents to make(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Italy Italy epicentre in Europe ,
wreaked(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) havoc(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) on Italy people , especially the frontline warriors- the doctors and nurses .
Within days , more than 15,000 people were killed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) and over a lakh others got(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) affected(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) by PPE .
In an attempt(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to restore(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) PPE humanitarian image following(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the crisis(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) , China projected(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to the that China would donate(#after 2020-04-05 09:55:06) PPE to Italy .
But later it was revealed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) , it was not a humanitarian gesture but a business-
China had actually sold(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) , not donated(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) , PPE to Italy , several media reports claimed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
A senior Trump administration official was quoted(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) by the Spectator magazine as saying(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) that it is much worse than that and China " forced(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Italy to buy(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) back the PPE supply that Italy gave(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to China during the Covid-19 outbreak in China . "
" Before the virus hit(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Europe , Italy sent(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) PPE to China to help(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) China protect(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Italy own population , " A senior Trump administration official explained(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
" China then has sent(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) PPE back to Italy -- some of PPE , not even all of PPE ... and charged(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) PPE for PPE , " A senior Trump administration official added(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
Unfortunately , China diplomacy in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak in China has been slippery .
Much of the supplies and testing(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) kits that China sold(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to other countries have turned(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) out to be defective .
Spain had to return(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) 50,000 quick - testing kits to China after discovering(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) that 50,000 quick - testing kits were faulty .
In some cases , instead of apologizing(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) or fixing(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the issue , China has blamed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) China defective equipment on others .
China condescendingly(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) told(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) The Netherlands to ' double(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the instructions(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) ' on The Netherlands masks , for example , after The Netherlands complained(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) that half of the masks they were sent(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) did not meet(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) safety standards , the media reported(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
" It 's so disingenuous for Chinese officials now to say(#included PRESENT_REF) Chinese officials are the ones who are helping(#included PRESENT_REF) the Italians or Chinese officials are the ones who are helping(#included PRESENT_REF) the developing(#overlap 2020-04-05 09:55:06) when , in fact , Chinese officials are the ones who infected(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) Chinese officials , " A senior Trump administration official said(#included PRESENT_REF) .
" Of course Chinese officials should be helping(#overlap 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
Chinese officials have(#overlap 2020-04-05 09:55:06) a special responsibility to help(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) because Chinese officials are the ones who began(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the spread of the coronavirus and did not give(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the information required(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to the rest of the to plan(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) accordingly , " A senior Trump administration official added(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
A senior Trump administration official also said(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) that China ' disinformation(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) campaign(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) ' of lying(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to the world about the seriousness of the Covid-19 outbreak in China has further delayed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the response(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) by countries .
As China downplayed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the Covid-19 outbreak in China , nearly half a million people traveled(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to the US potentially carrying(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the virus , A senior Trump administration official said(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) .
As the virus paves(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) the virus way through continents and various territories across the world , killing(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) people in millions and crippling economies , China has still been underreporting(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) about the accurate figures in the mainland .
China has also claimed(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) no new deaths(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) from the virus , even as thousands of ash urns are shipped(#before 2020-04-05 09:55:06) to local hospitals .
