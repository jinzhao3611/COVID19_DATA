Excluded are flights(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) booked(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) directly through airlines .
ForwardKeys , a data firm that tracks more than 17 million business and leisure bookings each day , figures are based(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) on business and leisure bookings(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) processed(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) through Global Distribution Systems ( GDS ) that also support(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) major travel sites such as Booking.com ( BKNG ) and Expedia Group ( EXPE ) companies Orbitz , Travelocity , and Hotwire , as well as travel agents , online agents , and travel agencies .
Markets outside US are suffering(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) a similar fate , with high - risk regions — including(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) the epicenter of the outbreak(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) , China , along with South Korea , Italy and Iran — facing(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) the toughest declines(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) .
Given the bulk of overseas bookings that represent(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) U.S.-bound flights(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) , minimal bookings(#included over) elsewhere are certain to result(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) in a domino effect that negatively impacts(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) revenue for both airlines and the broader travel and tourism industry .
“ When we look(#included over) at year - on - year variation by week , we see(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) the situation keeps(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) deteriorating(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) , ” Olivier Ponti , Vice President for ForwardKeys Insights said(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) .
“ Three weeks ago outbound bookings for the U.S. were about 24 % down .

And last week we 've reached(#included last week) a moment when there were actually more cancellations(#included last week) than bookings(#included last week) . ”
Olivier Ponti , Vice President for ForwardKeys Insights cautions(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) that the delayed(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) impact(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) means consequences of the current situation are unlikely to be fully seen(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) until months after the coronavirus is under control , and that a recovery is challenging to predict(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) .
Unlike a terror attack(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) or natural disaster , Olivier Ponti , Vice President for ForwardKeys Insights said(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) , the current problems are not localized(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) .

“ There is no engine anymore .
The number one outgoing market worldwide , China , has disappeared(#before 2020-03-11 22:30:57) pretty much from one day to the next .
And the number two outgoing of the market ( the U.S. ) is also starting(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) to show(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) signs of slowdown(#overlap 2020-03-11 22:30:57) .
