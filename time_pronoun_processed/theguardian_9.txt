Aaron Cresswell has admitted(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) has left(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) Aaron Cresswell “ petrified ” for his newborn baby and insists(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the Premier League should not be held(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) to ransom on a return(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) date .
The football calendar is currently suspended(#included currently) until April 30 , but suspended is widely expected(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) to get(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) extended(#after 2020-04-02 17:00:28) when the the Premier League clubs meet(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday .
Uefa said(#included Wednesday) on Wednesday that all domestic leagues should be finished(#included 2020-04-03) by early August , which is putting(#included 2020-04-03) pressure to restart(#included 2020-04-03) as soon as possible .
But Aaron Cresswell , says(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) football is not a priority .
“ At the start , Aaron Cresswell do n’t think(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) anyone realised(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) how serious football was , ” Aaron Cresswell told(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the club ’s official website .
“ Once Uefa played(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the Arsenal game , football came(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) to a stop(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) after [ Arsenal manager ] Mikel Arteta was tested(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) , and football came(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) back positive .
Uefa squad went(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) into isolation and then went was pretty much it .
There was no other option .
Football had to be suspended(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) .
“ Here we are four weeks later , football has been suspended(#before April 30) again until 30 April , but the most important thing is everyone ’s health and wellbeing .
Football can wait(#included 2020-04-03) .
Simple as that .
I ’ve got(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) a baby daughter and a baby daughter is five weeks ’ old and , I ’ve be honest , I ’m petrified(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) .
“ In I opinion , I think(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) there has been a lot of talk(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) about how quick we can get(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) football back , but the main focus should be on people ’s health and staying(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) indoors .
Of course , we ’re all missing(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) it but there is a whole bigger picture than a game of football and I believe(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) once all this has blown(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) over , we can get(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) back up and running(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) . ” Clubs are facing(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the prospect of losing(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) £ 750 m of TV revenue should the Premier League be cancelled(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) , meaning(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) losing is a scenario Clubs are trying to avoid .
Resuming(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the season behind closed doors is one idea that has been put(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) forward , but Aaron Cresswell has(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) Aaron Cresswell reservations .
Aaron Cresswell said(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) : “ There is talk of playing(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) games behind closed doors before the crowds return(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28)
but I hope(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) the players are respected(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) as much as the public are , and the players do n’t just ask(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) us to play(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) for entertainment on TV .
You ’re going(#overlap 2020-04-02 17:00:28) to need(#after 2020-04-02 17:00:28) all the officials , staff , medical provision , media and broadcasters
, so it ’s not just 22 players going(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) out and playing(#before 2020-04-02 17:00:28) football . ”
