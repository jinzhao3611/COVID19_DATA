Who could have imagined(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) that the coronavirus pandemic would be , in part , an automotive story ?
More than that : Automakers , in particular GM and Ford but also plenty of others , may wind(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) up being some of the story 's heroes .
The New York Times had(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) a glimpse inside the GM effort the other day , and now The Seattle Times ' Geoff Baker provides(#included now) a better sense of the timeline by which General Motors and Ventec Life Systems , of Bothell , Washington , went(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) from perfect strangers to partners in mass - producing(#overlap 2020-04-01 00:50:11) Ventec's innovative multifunction ventilators — devices that might ultimately save the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans .
This is all happening(#overlap 2020-04-01 00:50:11) astonishingly fast .
Two weeks ago , the project seemed(#included Two weeks ago) dead before the project had even begun(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) , The Seattle Times ' Geoff Baker reports(#overlap 2020-04-01 00:50:11) .
The Ventec machine has(#overlap 2020-04-01 00:50:11) 700 components .
But one of them was made(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) in India , in a factory that was in coronavirus lockdown .
Without one of them , The Ventec machine might as well be a doorstop .
“ GM literally sent(#included Two weeks ago) people there that night to India to get(#included Two weeks ago) boots on the ground to help(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) us get(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) a factory that was in coronavirus lockdown opened , ” Ventec CEO Chris Kiple told(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) The New York Times .
“ It changed(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) the conversation . ”
GM had to get(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) that supplier going(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) again , as well as that supplier suppliers on back up the chain , and GM had to surmount(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) many other problems on other fronts .
But just as Ventec's brings(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) Ventec's technology and patents to the table , GM brings(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) a century of experience making(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) a thing — many copies of a thing — and pulling(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) together a worldwide web of suppliers and resources to do making .
Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) Ventec's had sought(#after early March) a partner since early March .
Thirty seconds into Ventec CEO Chris Kiple first call with GM on March 19 , Ventec CEO Chris Kiple knew(#included March 19) Ventec CEO Chris Kiple 'd found(#included March 19) it .
“ Where we had talked(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) to many other people , GM went(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) into action , ’’ Kiple said(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) .
“ There was no talk(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) .
… It was just , ‘ What do Ventec CEO Chris Kiple need(#overlap 2020-04-01 00:50:11) ? ’’ ’
went was the 19th .
By the 20th , GM had(#included the 20th) people in India solving(#included March 19) that supplier problem .
By the 22nd , GM had(#included the 20th) dozens of people in Bothell , Washington who then fanned(#included the 20th) out .
The New York Times describes(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) how GM zeroed(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) in on a $ 4 million parts order from a crucial supplier in neighboring Woodinville .
Ventec's builds(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) 250 ventilators a month in Bothell , Washington .
With GM help(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) , Ventec's 'll get(#after 2020-04-01 00:50:11) that number up to 2,000 .
Meanwhile the partners expect(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) to start(#included mid - April) building(#included mid - April) machines at a GM plant in Kokomo , Ind. , in mid - April and quickly ramp up to 10,000 a month there , for a total monthly output of 12,000 .
And , Ventec CEO Chris Kiple says(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) , GM is doing building at cost .
That 's right :
From initial phone call(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) to mass production(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) of a complex device that GM previously knew(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) nothing about .
In a month .
It 's difficult to understand(#before 2020-04-01 00:50:11) how " GM was wasting(#included the 20th) time , " which was the White House 's accusation(#included last Friday) last Friday before President Trump eventually sang(#included Monday) a different tune on Monday .
A feeling of pride would be the more appropriate response(#after 2020-04-01 00:50:11) .
