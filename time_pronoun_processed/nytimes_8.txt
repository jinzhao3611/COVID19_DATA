Cuomo Is a Media Hero in the Pandemic. De Blasio Is a Scapegoat. .
2020-04-01 21:22:21 +00:00 .
And De Blasio ?
Cuomo was somewhere in the middle , like most of the media that is now keeping(#included now) score .
His painfully public three - day Hamlet act over closing schools ended(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) with Cuomo announcing(#included March 16) that they ’d be closed(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) just minutes before De Blasio ’s planned announcement(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) — both of them days behind some other school systems around the country .
Ms. Breed had(#included March 16) Ms. Breed city “ shelter in place ” March 16 ; De Blasio aired(#included March 17) His painfully public three - day Hamlet act over closing schools March 17 , to be immediately rebuked(#included March 17) by Cuomo .
Today , Cuomo overrode(#included Today) Cuomo to close(#included Today) playgrounds .
both of them have tiptoed(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) around one another , and on Tuesday held(#included Tuesday) news conferences at the same hospital ship , an hour apart .
De Blasio told(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) me De Blasio hesitation(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) to shut(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) schools and , effectively , the city was focused(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) on the city as De Blasio saw(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) it .
“ The vast majority of New Yorkers are working - class people , are lower income folks , who have(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) no option but to stand(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) and fight(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) , ” De Blasio said(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) .
“ They ca n’t go(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) any place else , They do n’t have(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) an alternative to child care , They do n’t have(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) a nanny . ”
And De Blasio blamed(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) the media for overlooking(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) those groups to focus(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) on the more affluent classes .
“ Our discourse is inherently about a small subset of our people . ”
The problem with De Blasio argument(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) , of course , is that the poor get(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) sick , too .
People close to De Blasio say(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) De Blasio erred(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) in taking(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) a reflexively ideological approach to a fast - moving health crisis .
One former aide worried(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) that Cuomo filtered(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) the pandemic(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) through “ a social justice lens ’’ that does not work(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) for this moment .
De Blasio rejects(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) the criticism(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) that De Blasio let(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) De Blasio preoccupation(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) with inequality overwhelm(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) De Blasio more universal obligations(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) .
But De Blasio says(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) the emerging(#included Tuesday) story of a fast - moving health crisis will be about the old inequalities as much as about a fast - moving health crisis .
the city has released(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) largely useless data about where the coronavirus is hitting(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) hardest .
New data is nearly ready , De Blasio said(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) , and when New data ’s released(#included later this week) later this week , New data will show(#after 2020-04-01 21:22:21) that clearly .
“ We ’re going(#after 2020-04-01 21:22:21) to be able to put(#after 2020-04-01 21:22:21) out much more true data that will show(#after 2020-04-01 21:22:21) this tracking(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) with the health disparities that are historically known(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) , ” De Blasio said(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) .
“ Coronavirus is equal opportunity , and we have to save(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) and protect(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) everyone — but it ’s increasingly clear where We ’re losing(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) lots of people and how We ’re connects(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) back to historic disparities . ”
De Blasio ’s hair has cooled(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) off as the briefings have gone(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) on ; De Blasio continues(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) to drive(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) De Blasio aides crazy by refusing(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) to trust(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) information , as The New York Times ’ Jeffery C. Mays and Joseph Goldstein reported(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) , until De Blasio has “ processed(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) information De Blasio . ”
De Blasio ’s scrambling(#overlap 2020-04-01 21:22:21) like other executives to get(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) supplies for the city ; De Blasio was on the phone Monday , De Blasio said(#included Monday) , with the chief executive of a Swedish ventilator company , pleading New York ’s case .
the chief executive of a Swedish ventilator company , pleading New York ’s case ’s now under fire from the right for releasing(#before 2020-04-01 21:22:21) inmates from city jails .
