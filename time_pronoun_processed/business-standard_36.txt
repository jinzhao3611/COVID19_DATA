2020-03-22 20:00:03 +00:00 .
The weak markets have not had(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) an impact on the government ’s ( STT ) kitty , which went(#included current fiscal year) up about 5 per cent year - on - year ( YoY ) in the current fiscal year to date .
According to an official in the Income Tax Department , STT collection stood(#included 2019-04) at Rs 11,247 crore for fiscal year 2019 - 20 ( FY20 ) , until March 15 , against the targeted(#before 2020-03-15) Rs 12,500 crore .
the Income Tax Department is hoping(#overlap 2020-03-22 20:00:03) that the target will be crossed(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) .
The reason for the higher STT is heightened(#included 2019-04) volumes in the futures and options segment during April 2019 to January 2020 , even as volumes fell(#included 2020-02) in February .
So far this fiscal year , equity derivatives turnover have gone(#included 2020) up 43 per cent , while overall market turnover across both cash and derivatives segments was up 39 per cent .
Even tax payouts from dividend distribution tax ( DDT ) are up 2 per cent because of changes in the tax structure from April 1 , which require(#included 2019-04) firms to shell(#included 2019-04) out more on dividends in the current fiscal year .
Typically , collections had declined(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) during weak market conditions or fall(#included 2020) in stock prices , but this fiscal year ’s activity on the futures and options front is helping(#included 2020-02) tax collections .
For instance , collection dropped(#included 2019-04) below Rs 500 crore in FY13 amid a downturn(#included 2020) in the market .
Since then , collection has been on the rise(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) thanks to an upward trend in the market .
In FY19 , the government collected(#included 2020) Rs 11,528 crore from STT , of which Mumbai contributed(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) Rs 11 , 235 crore .
the market performed(#included 2019-04) relatively well between April 2019 and January 2020 , but in February , the sharp sell - off sparked(#included 2020) by the coronavirus outbreak(#included 2020) pushed(#included 2020) the Nifty and Sensex into bear territory , eroding(#included 2020) billions of rupees of investor wealth .
Total derivatives trading volume fell(#included 2020-04-01) 22 per cent in February , while in the cash segment total volumes were down 2 per cent .
Introduced(#included FY13) in 2004 , STT is levied(#included FY13) on all stock market transactions(#included FY13) .
The tax is in the range of 0.017 per cent and 0.125 per cent of the transaction(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) amount .
The STT rate for delivery - based trades(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) is 0.1 per cent , while that on intra - day trades(#included 2019-04) is 0.025 per cent .
Similarly , the tax levy on derivatives trade(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) is between 0.01 per cent and 0.05 per cent , unless an option contract is exercised(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) .
Meanwhile , DDT collection ( up to March 15 ) stood(#included 2020) at Rs 51,873 crore .
Of this domestic companies paid(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) Rs 46,720 crore and mutual funds payout was Rs 5,153 crore .
In FY19 , the total collection was Rs 57,114 crore , according to data .
This is because dividends payouts were advanced(#included 2020-02) by this domestic companies in February after the Union Budget announced(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) changes in DDT structure .
the Union Budget announced(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) abolition(#included 2020-02) of DDT of 20.56 per cent paid(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) by companies , but said(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) taxes on dividends would be levied(#after 2020-03-22 20:00:03) on individuals .
Market players say(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) companies are advancing(#overlap 2020-03-22 20:00:03) companies dividend payouts to lower(#before 2020-03-22 20:00:03) the tax burden of promoters , who will have to pay(#included 2020-04) tax in excess of 40 per cent from April .
In February , about 200 companies declared(#included 2020-02) interim dividends , which was over double that of the corresponding period last year .
Payouts , too , were higher(#included FY19) than last year .
Total direct tax ( net collection ) up to March 15 , however , slipped(#included 2020-03-15) by 5.3 per cent and stood(#included FY19) at Rs 9.57 trillion against the revised(#included 2020-03-15) target of Rs 11.7 trillion .
