Thus , foreign tourist arrivals(#included 2020-02) in India , which saw(#included 2020-03) a 9 % decline(#included 2020-03) in February 2020 ( 1.02 million ) over January ( 1.12 million ) , and a 7 % fall(#included 2019-02) from February 2019 ( 1.09 million ) , further plummeted(#included 2020-02) in March 2020 .

The shutting(#included 2020-03-25) down of the iconic Taj Mahal on March 17 , which attracted(#included 2020-02) over 7 million visitors — both domestic and foreign — in 2018 - 19 , was an evocative symbol of the dramatically altered(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) tourism picture .
The was in trouble(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) even before the rise of the pandemic(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) , experiencing(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) the impact of the global economic slowdown(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:05:23) .
The revenue losses(#after 2020-04-19 15:05:23) in the sector would run(#after 2020-04-19 15:05:23) into multiple quarters , Pavethra Ponniah , vice president , ICRA , said(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) .
“ Several hotels have already let(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) go of all contractual labourers .
While there are discussions(#overlap 2020-04-19 15:05:23) on pay cuts(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) , we are not hearing(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) of permanent labourer cuts(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) yet .
A prolonged downcycle could , however , lead(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) to those also being pruned(#before 2020-04-19 15:05:23) . ”
