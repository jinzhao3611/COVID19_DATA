2020-05-27 06:42:00 +00:00 .
Dominic Cummings is facing(#included Monday) questions about Dominic Cummings claim in Monday ’s press conference(#included last year) to have written(#included last year) last year about the “ possible threat of coronaviruses ” after it emerged(#included March 2019) that a blogpost published in March 2019 was rewritten(#included last month) last month to insert(#included March 2019) a reference to “ Sars coronavirus ” .
a blogpost published in March 2019 is largely a lengthy excerpt from research published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warning about the risks of viruses escaping secure laboratories .
In April 2020 , a lengthy excerpt from research published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warning about the risks of viruses escaping secure laboratories was edited(#included April 2020) to add(#included April 2020) a quote about a “ well - publicised incident(#included April 2020) in China in which ‘ two researchers conducting virus research were exposed(#included April 2020) to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( Sars ) coronavirus samples that were incompletely inactivated(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) .
‘ two researchers conducting virus research subsequently transmitted(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) Sars to others , leading(#included 2004) to several infections and one death(#included 2004) in 2004 . ’ ” .
a lengthy excerpt from research published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warning about the risks of viruses escaping secure laboratories is the only mention(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) of the word “ coronavirus ” on Cummings ’ personal blog .
First spotted(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) by Jens Wiechers , a data scientist , the edits are verifiable through periodic snapshots of Cummings ’ personal blog .
A hidden record on Cummings ’ personal blog shows(#included March 2019) Cummings ’ personal blog was edited(#included 4 March last year) at 8:55pm on 14 April , the day he has told(#included 4 March last year) the public he had returned(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) from he trip(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) to Durham .
Downing Street was asked(#included last year) at 8 am on Tuesday to explain(#included last year) why Cummings , Boris Johnson ’s principal adviser , had said(#included last year) at the press conference(#included 4 March last year) that Cummings , Boris Johnson ’s principal adviser , “ last year wrote(#included 4 March last year) about the possible threat of coronaviruses ” , when Cummings , Boris Johnson ’s principal adviser , only apparent blogpost on the subject was edited(#included last month) this year to include(#included last month) a reference to coronaviruses for the first time – after the current pandemic had hit .
No 10 has not yet replied(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) to asked .
At the morning press briefing(#included 4 March last year) , Johnson ’s official spokesman said(#included 4 March last year) : “ Johnson ’s official spokesman do n’t personally know(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) anything about the possible threat of coronaviruses ” . ”
Rather than warning(#included last year) about the threat of coronaviruses , Cummings ’ personal blog was in fact a specific warning about the threat of a “ lab release(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) ” origin for a future pandemic(#after 2020-05-27 06:42:00) .
a lengthy excerpt from research published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warning about the risks of viruses escaping secure laboratories does not refer(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) to Sars - CoV-2 , the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic , but to the original Sars virus , now known(#included last year) as Sars - CoV-1 .
There is no evidence that Sars - CoV-2 , the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic originated(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) from a lab release(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) , though the theory has been pushed(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) by a number of influential sources , including(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) the US Republican party .
Donald Trump has claimed(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) Donald Trump has seen(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) evidence Sars - CoV-2 , the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic escaped(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) from a Chinese lab , but has not publicly shared(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) the source .
Pressed(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) to explain(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) what Donald Trump had seen(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) , Donald Trump said(#included 2020-03-31) : “ Donald Trump ca n’t tell(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) you that .
Donald Trump ’m not allowed(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) to tell(#before 2020-05-27 06:42:00) you that . ”
