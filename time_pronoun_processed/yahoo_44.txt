Senator Martha McSally called(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus a “ communist ” and accused(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of helping(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) China conceal(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) China underreporting of coronavirus case numbers .
“ I ’ve never trusted(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) a communist , ” Senator Martha McSally said(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) in an interview(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) with Fox Business .
“ Senator Martha McSally think(#included 2020-04-02) WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus needs(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to step down , ” Senator Martha McSally continued(#included 2020-04-02) .
“ We need(#overlap 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to take(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) some action to address(#after 2020-04-02 19:38:31) this issue .
It ’s just irresponsible , it ’s unconscionable what they have done here while we have(#overlap 2020-04-02 19:38:31) people dying(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) across the globe . ”
Senator Martha McSally condemned(#included 2020-04-02) China for failing(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to acknowledge(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) and curb(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) the coronavirus , which originated in China before the coronavirus , which originated in China spilled(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) over China ’s borders and spread to the rest of the globe .
“ they cover - up of the coronavirus , which originated in China , has caused(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) unnecessary deaths(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) around America and around the globe .
the World Health Organization needs(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to stop(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) covering for they , ” Senator Martha McSally said(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) , adding(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) that as restitution , any U.S. debts to China “ should be forgiven(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) , as a minimum . ”
Senator Martha McSally ’s criticism(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) comes(#overlap 2020-04-02 19:38:31) days after another GOP senator , Rick Scott of Florida , called(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) for a congressional investigation(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) into the World Health Organization and questioned(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) whether the World Health Organization should continue(#after 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to be funded(#after 2020-04-02 19:38:31) since the World Health Organization engaged(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) in “ helping(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) Communist China cover(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) up ” the seriousness of the coronavirus , which originated in China .
“ We know(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) Communist China is lying(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) about how many cases and deaths(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) Communist China have(#overlap 2020-04-02 19:38:31) , what Communist China knew(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) and when Communist China knew(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) lying — and the World Health Organization never bothered(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to investigate(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) further , ” another GOP senator , Rick Scott of Florida , said(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) .
“ Communist China inaction cost(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) lives . ”
the World Health Organization also “ willfully parroted(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) propaganda ” from China ’s Communist Party , another GOP senator , Rick Scott of Florida , charged(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) .
During an interview(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) with Radio Television Hong Kong , the World Health Organization assistant director - general Dr. Bruce Aylward appeared(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to dodge(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) a question about whether the WHO will reconsider granting membership to Taiwan , which China claims as a territory .
Taiwan , which has reported(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) just slightly more than 300 cases of the infection and only two deaths(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) , has been widely praised(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) for the World Health Organization containment of the coronavirus , which originated in China .
the director of the World Health Organization responded(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) that the director of the World Health Organization could not hear(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) a question about whether the WHO will reconsider granting membership to Taiwan , which China claims as a territory , and when the interviewer offered(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to repeat(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) a question about whether the WHO will reconsider granting membership to Taiwan , which China claims as a territory the interviewer interjected(#included 2020-04-02) , “ no , that ’s
okay , let ’s move(#after 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to another one then . ”
Later , the director of the World Health Organization appeared(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to hang(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) up when asked(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) about Taiwan ’s response(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) to the infection , and afterwards said(#included 2020-04-02) they had “ already talked(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) about China . ”
The U.S. intelligence community concluded(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) in a classified report(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) obtained(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) by Fox Business that China deliberately provided(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) incomplete public numbers for coronavirus cases and deaths(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) resulting(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) from the infection .
In December , local and national officials issued(#included 2019-12) a gag order to labs in Wuhan after scientists there identified(#included 2019-12) a new viral pneumonia , ordering(#included 2019-12) scientists there to halt(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) tests(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) , destroy(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) samples , and conceal(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) the news .
America now has(#included PRESENT_REF) nearly 240,000 cases of the coronavirus , which originated in China around China , and more than 5,000 have died(#before 2020-04-02 19:38:31) .
