The real number of coronavirus cases is more than 75,000, according to a scientific model that says(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) the outbreak will double(#after 2020-02-01 04:52:42) in size every 6.4 days .

A new study suggests(#overlap 2020-02-01 04:52:42) that official figures for the scale of the outbreak have been far too low .
A new study projected(#included January 25) that as of January 25 , there were 75,815 people infected(#included January 25) in Wuhan .

A new study dismissed(#included January 25) a lockdown(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) in Wuhan as " negligible , " since the outbreak had already spread(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) by the time the outbreak was implemented(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) .

The true number of people infected with the deadly Wuhan coronavirus is more than 75,000 , according to a scientific model , which claims the official number for those infected is far too low .
Academics at the University of Hong Kong published(#included Friday) a paper on Friday in the prestigious Lancet journal , estimating(#included Friday) the rate at which the outbreak is spreading(#overlap 2020-02-01 04:52:42) .
Academics at the University of Hong Kong used(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) official data on the number of infections to calculate(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) what Academics at the University of Hong Kong said(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) was the true extent of the outbreak â€” almost 100 times the official figures .
Underpinning(#overlap 2020-02-01 04:52:42) A new study is the idea that the number of international cases is disproportionately high given(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) the number of people who travel(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) from Wuhan to other countries .

Academics at the University of Hong Kong used(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) the official figures to reverse(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) a total for the number of cases among greater Wuhan population of around 19 million .
Academics at the University of Hong Kong said(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) that , as of January 25 , Academics at the University of Hong Kong estimated(#included January 25) that the number of cases was 75,815.According to CNN , the official total on January 25 for the whole of Hubei province , which includes(#included January 25) greater Wuhan , was 761 , barely 1 % of the total projected(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) by Academics at the University of Hong Kong .
a paper is not the first to suggest(#overlap 2020-02-01 04:52:42) that the official figures do not adequately capture(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) the scope of the outbreak .
A paper from Imperial College London published(#included January 17) on January 17 suggested(#included January 17) that the official figures were too low by a factor of 35.As part of a scientific model , which claims the official number for those infected is far too low , Academics at the University of Hong Kong predicted(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) that the scale of the outbreak would double(#after 2020-02-01 04:52:42) every 6.4 days .
By predicted , the number of people in greater Wuhan with the outbreak as of this Friday ( January 31 ) would be 151,630 .
The official number of cases on January 31 was less than 10,000 .
The official number of cases on January 31 increased(#included February 1) to around 12,000 as of February 1 local time .
The authors of the study said(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) The authors of the study had taken(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) into account the effect of a city - wide lockdown .
However , The authors of the study said(#included 2020-04-02) that the outbreak overall effectiveness would be " negligible " given(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) that a critical mass of cases had already been observed(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) in several other cities .
In a meeting(#included 2020-04-02) on Thursday , the World Health Organization declared(#included 2020-04-02) the outbreak a global health emergency(#included 2020-04-02) .
On Friday , the US government announced(#included Friday) a ban(#included Friday) on any foreigner entering(#included Friday) the country within 14 days of being in mainland China .
the World Health Organization said(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) US citizens would be allowed(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) to enter(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) but placed(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) in quarantine(#before 2020-02-01 04:52:42) .
