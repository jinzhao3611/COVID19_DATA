MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Indians breathed(#included 2020-03-30) easier on Monday as lockdowns ordered(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) to combat(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) the spread of the coronavirus in India ’s megacities kept(#included 2020-03-30) cars off the road and closed(#included 2020-03-30) factories , improving(#included 2020-03-30) air quality and letting(#included 2020-03-30) people see(#included 2020-03-30) blue skies instead of heavy gray smog .

REUTERS / Francis Mascarenhas / File Photo Last year , India accounted(#included Last year) for around half of the world ’s 50 most polluted(#included Last year) cities , according to Swiss firm IQAir , with emissions caused(#included Last year) partly by industry , vehicle exhaust and coal - fired plants .
Now , however , New Delhi and at least 75 Indian districts are under lockdown(#included Now) to stop(#included Now) coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in the country .
Many Indians also heeded(#included 2020-04-05) Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s call to observe(#included 2020-04-05) voluntary confinement(#included 2020-04-05) on Sunday , leaving(#included 2020-04-05) roads that are usually crammed(#included 2020-04-05) with cars , rickshaws , motor - bikes and buses eerily empty .
In New Delhi , the Air Quality Index sank(#included Monday afternoon) to roughly 93 , a level considered(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) moderate , on Monday afternoon .
New Delhi ’s air is regularly considered(#overlap 2020-03-23 09:58:12) unhealthy , and AQI averaged(#included March 2019) around 161 in March 2019 , according to Swiss firm IQAir .
In Mumbai , India , levels were at 90 , versus an average of around 153 in March 2019 .
Air quality is deemed(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) to be good when the number drops(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) below 50 .
“ ( The drop ) is mainly because of a huge reduction(#included 2020-03-30) in vehicular traffic , ” said(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) Dr. Gufran Beig , project director at the government environment monitoring agency SAFAR .
As a result , skyscrapers usually shrouded(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) in smog were visible(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) and some residents reported(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) spotting(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) more stars than usual .
“ We went(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) for a walk(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) and Dr. Gufran Beig , project director at the government environment monitoring agency SAFAR wife found(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) that breathing was easier , ” said(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) Dr. Gufran Beig , project director at the government environment monitoring agency SAFAR .
India ’s toxic air claimed(#included 2017) 1.24 million lives in 2017 , according to a study published(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) in Lancet Planetary Health .
Some research also links(#overlap 2020-03-23 09:58:12) air pollution to an increased(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) risk of respiratory virus infections - which include(#overlap 2020-03-23 09:58:12) COVID-19 , the disease caused(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) by the coronavirus in India ’s megacities .
“ Once We get(#before 2020-03-23 09:58:12) over this crisis , this crisis will be as bad as before , ” Dr. Gufran Beig , project director at the government environment monitoring agency SAFAR said(#included 2020-04-05) while walking(#included 2020-04-05) on a quiet Mumbai , India road .
