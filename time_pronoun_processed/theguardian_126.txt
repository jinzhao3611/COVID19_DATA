Lockdown protests may have spread(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) virus widely, cellphone data suggests(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) .
2020-05-18 10:11:46 +00:00 .
Cellphone location data suggests(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that demonstrators at anti - lockdown protests – some of which have been connected with Covid-19 cases – are often traveling(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) hundreds of miles to events , returning(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to all parts of demonstrators at anti - lockdown protests – some of which have been connected with Covid-19 cases – states , and even crossing(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) into neighboring ones .
Cellphone location data raises(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) the prospect that Lockdown protests will play(#after 2020-05-18 10:11:46) a role in spreading(#after 2020-05-18 10:11:46) the coronavirus epidemic(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to areas which have , so far , experienced relatively few infections .
The anonymized location data was captured(#included late April) from opt - in cellphone apps , and data scientists at the firm VoteMap used(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) The anonymized location data to determine(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) the movements of devices present at protests(#included late April) in late April and early May in five states : Michigan , Wisconsin , Illinois , Colorado and Florida .
data scientists at the firm VoteMap then created(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) visualizations that tracked the movements of those devices up to 48 hours after the conclusion of protests .
visualizations that tracked the movements of those devices up to 48 hours after the conclusion of protests only show(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) movements within states , due to the queries(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) analysts made(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) in creating(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) movements within states .
But the data scientist Jeremy Fair , executive - vice president of the firm VoteMap , says(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that many of the devices that are seen to reach state borders are seen(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to continue(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) across many of the devices that are seen to reach state borders in the underlying(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) raw data .
One visualization shows(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that in Lansing , Michigan , after a 30 April protest(#included 30 April) in which armed protesters stormed(#included 30 April) the capitol building and state police were forced(#included 30 April) to physically block(#included late April) access to Governor Gretchen Whitmer , devices which had been present at the protest(#included 30 April) site can be seen(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) returning(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to all parts of Michigan , from Detroit to remote towns in the state ’s north .
One device visible in The anonymized location data traveled(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to and from Afton , which is over 180 miles from Lansing , Michigan .
Others reached(#included late April) , and some crossed(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) , the Indiana border .
In the 48 hours following(#included late April) a 19 April “ Operation Gridlock ” protest(#included 19 April) in Detroit , devices reached(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) the borders of neighboring(#included late April) states including(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) Wyoming , Nebraska , Oklahoma , New Mexico and Utah .
In Florida on 18 April , devices returned(#included 18 April) to all parts of the peninsula and up to the Indiana border .
In Wisconsin on 18 April , devices returned(#included 24 April) to smaller towns like Green Bay and Wausau , and the borders of Minnesota and Illinois .
Following(#included 2020-04) the initial wave of anti - lockdown protests(#included 2020-04) in 18 April , epidemiologists warned(#included 2020-04) that smaller towns like Green Bay and Wausau , and the borders of Minnesota and Illinois could lead(#after 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to a new surge(#after 2020-05-18 10:11:46) in cases .
In North Carolina in late April , one of the leaders of the state ’s anti - lockdown protests tested(#included late April) positive for Covid-19 but said(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) one of the leaders of the state ’s anti - lockdown protests would attend(#after 2020-05-18 10:11:46) future rallies .
Dr Rob Davidson , executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare , said(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that although “ it ’s hard to draw(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) a straight line between devices , individuals at Lockdown protests , and cases ” , Cellphone location data suggests(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that Lockdown protests may be epidemiologically significant events .
“ The behavior we ’re seeing(#included 2020-04) at protests(#included 2020-04) carries(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) a high risk of infection .
We can see(#included 2020-04) protesters are going(#included 2020-04) from a highly concentrated event and then dispersing(#included 2020-04) widely , ” Dr Rob Davidson , executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare , added(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) .
Davidson , who has run for Congress as a Democrat , said(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that neither Davidson , who has run for Congress as a Democrat , nor his advocacy group were currently affiliated(#included currently) with the Democratic party .
his advocacy group is made(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) up of more than 300 “ doctors who are concerned(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) that the healthcare for their patients has become(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) unaffordable ” .
In a series of widely shared(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) videos and threads on Twitter , Davidson , who has run for Congress as a Democrat , has criticized(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) Trump , and attempted(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) to dispel(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) what Davidson , who has run for Congress as a Democrat , calls(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) the “ distrust(#overlap 2020-05-18 10:11:46) in public health ” which “ Trump has fomented(#before 2020-05-18 10:11:46) in Trump movement ” .
