By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Yoruk Bahceli LONDON , April 16 ( Reuters ) - Sweden ’s Verisure is looking(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to become(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) the first junk - rated company to access(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) European bond markets in nearly two months , with hefty central bank stimulus helping(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to restore confidence in a market battered by the COVID-19 crisis .
A successful deal for the Swedish maker of security alarms could pave(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) the way for other companies with low credit ratings .
Verisure is looking(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to price(#after 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a 150 million - euro ( $ 163.26 million ) issue of senior secured five - year bonds later on Thursday , according to a lead manager .
senior secured five - year bonds are redeemable(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) after just one year , a lead manager added(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) .
If successful , A successful deal for the Swedish maker of security alarms will reopen(#after 2020-04-16 12:28:35) the market for debt sales(#after 2020-04-16 12:28:35) from Europe ’s riskier corporate borrowers , which has been shut(#after Feb 20) since Feb 20
European companies have faced(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a less receptive market than those in the U.S. , where 20 junk - rated companies have sold(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) more than $ 13 billion of debt since a market battered by the COVID-19 crisis reopened(#included first week of April) in first week of April , according to Refinitiv IFR data .
“ The European market usually takes(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) The European market lead from the U.S.
the U.S. reopened(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) with low cyclical names that needed(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) liquidity and has gradually moved(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to more cyclical businesses needing(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a liquidity boost , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) David Newman , chief investment officer of global high - yield at Allianz Global Investors .
“ If successful Allianz Global Investors would expect(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to see(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) more defensive names [ in Europe ] also come(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to a market battered by the COVID-19 crisis before any dip down into the more challenged(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) sectors . ”
The spread of coronavirus has hit(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) so - called junk bonds hard , with average yields in The European market trebling(#included first week of April) from 2.73 % in late February to 8.87 % at their March 23 peak , according to Markit ’s iBoxx index of high - yield debt .
The European Central Bank has since pledged(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to pump(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) unprecedented amounts of money into bond markets .
Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve , The European Central Bank only buys(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) investment - grade debt , , but the strength of the stimulus has lifted(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) sentiment .
“ Though it has been quiet in Europe , a market battered by the COVID-19 crisis has been open , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a source familiar with A successful deal for the Swedish maker of security alarms .
“ But A successful deal for the Swedish maker of security alarms is likely expensive and slightly restrictive in terms of size , covenants and position in the capital structure . ”
Verisure is having to pay(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) up for the privilege of issuing(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) new debt - marketing A successful deal for the Swedish maker of security alarms to price at a 5 % yield , far higher than the 3.5 % Verisure paid(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) last time Verisure sold(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a bond with a similar tenor .
High - yield market participants believe(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) appetite for deals exists(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) , should other European companies be prepared to pay(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) that type of premium .
“ Many sectors are under pressure(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to maintain(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) credit ratings so are under pressure not to pay(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) dividends and preserve(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) cash , which is to the benefit of credit holders , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) Andrey Kuznetsov , a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes , a 435 billion - pound ( $ 542.53 billion ) London - based fund manager .
But bankers arranging(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) junk deals note(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) that after refinancing(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) of debt to take(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) advantage of low interest rates over the past couple of years , few junk - rated European companies have(#overlap 2020-04-16 12:28:35) immediate financing needs .
few junk - rated European companies can wait(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to secure(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) more attractive rates .
“ The new reality of fair value and new issue premiums is going(#after 2020-04-16 12:28:35) to put(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) the vast majority of issuers off unless the vast majority of issuers absolutely have to [ sell(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a bond ] , ” said(#before 2020-04-16 12:28:35) a head of syndicate at a European bank .
JP Morgan is global coordinator on A successful deal for the Swedish maker of security alarms and joint bookrunner along with Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Nordea .
