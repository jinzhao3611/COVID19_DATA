A cluster of cases in Senegal ’s holy city of Touba in March prompted(#included March) President Macky Sall to close schools and ban(#included March) religious gatherings , one of the first leaders in sub - Saharan Africa to do so .
A Senegalese man returning from Italy had infected(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) 17 others , including(#included March) A Senegalese man returning from Italy 2 - year - old child , just weeks before Senegal ’s second city was due to host thousands of pilgrims at a religious festival(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) .
Senegal ’s holy city of Touba is the headquarters of a powerful Sufi Muslim brotherhood and known(#included Now) to some as “ little Mecca ” .
Its Grand Mosque , whose white minarets tower over the city of 1.5 million people , was ordered(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) to close(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) Its Grand Mosque , whose white minarets tower over the city of 1.5 million people doors .

The number of cases in Senegal ’s holy city of Touba has climbed(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) steadily since then despite the intervention(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) of the army , which is testing for COVID-19 , the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus , at a makeshift field hospital and decontaminating streets and markets .
“ Perhaps it ’s ignorance or even some denial(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) of the outbreak of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in Touba , Senegal May 1 , 2020 , ” said(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) Sylla Mbacke , head doctor at Senegal ’s holy city of Touba ’s main health centre , Darou Marnane .

WORSHIPPERS TURNED AWAY
Senegal ’s holy city of Touba appeared(#included Friday) quieter than usual during a recent visit(#included recent) by Reuters , but despite government guidelines(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) only a few people were wearing(#included recent) masks in the streets .
Some sought(#included April 11) entry(#included April 11) to Its Grand Mosque , whose white minarets tower over the city of 1.5 million people for Friday prayers but were turned(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) away .
Mbacke ’s centre is coping(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) with the caseload , thanks in part to the army , which is testing for COVID-19 , the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus , at a makeshift field hospital and decontaminating streets and markets .
But with no ventilators or intensive care beds , Mbacke ’s centre could quickly become(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) overwhelmed(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) .
The World Health Organization has warned(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) that sub - Saharan Africa could become(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) the next epicentre of the outbreak of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in Touba , Senegal May 1 , 2020 .

Touba ’s main market , ground zero for the second wave of cases must now close(#included PRESENT_REF) at 3 p.m. , making(#included PRESENT_REF) it harder to earn(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) a living , and residents are unable to gather(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) to break(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) residents daily fast during the sacred month of Ramadan .
“ What can be done apart from pray(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) for the outbreak of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in Touba , Senegal May 1 , 2020 to leave(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) the planet , ” trader Abdoulaye Diagne said(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) , as trader Abdoulaye Diagne packed(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) up the plastic cups trader Abdoulaye Diagne had been selling(#before 2020-05-11 10:29:42) to go(#included 2020-W13) home .
