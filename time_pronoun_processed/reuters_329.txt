Sterling will be nearly 4 % stronger in a year than Sterling is now , according to a Reuters poll of market strategists , based(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) on expectations(#included 2020) that Britain will secure(#included 2020) a trade deal with the European Union this year despite Britain tough initial stance(#included year-end) .

On Monday Sterling took(#included Monday) a pummelling(#included Monday) after Prime Minister Boris Johnson set(#included Monday) tough terms for the trade talks(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) .
Some of the forecasts(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) in the Reuters poll were gathered(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) before Johnson ’s speech .
Britain left(#included Monday) the European Union on Friday and Johnson ’s comments(#included Monday) on Monday have rekindled(#included Monday) fears(#included Monday) of a cliff - edge - whereby no trade deal is agreed(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) - at the end of an 11 - month transition(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) period(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) Prime Minister Boris Johnson wo n’t ask(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) to extend(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) .
Foreign exchange strategists in Reuters polls have repeatedly said(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) that leaving(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) without a deal , and so trading(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) on World Trade Organisation rules only , would be rough for the economy and the worst outcome(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) for Sterling .
Sterling ended(#included January) January on a high note after the Bank of England surprised(#included Monday) many by leaving(#included January) borrowing costs on hold but fell(#included Monday) as much as 1.7 % to $ 1.2984 on Monday .
Sterling was trading(#included Monday) around $ 1.30 on Friday after better - than - expected construction(#included Monday) data .
Median forecasts(#included Jan. 31) in the Jan. 31 - Feb. 4 poll of 65 strategists showed(#included Jan. 31) Sterling would be up at $ 1.31 in a month , $ 1.32 in six months and then $ 1.35 in a year ’s time .
That is still well below the $ 1.50 Sterling was trading(#included November 14 , 2017) at before the June 2016 referendum(#included November 14 , 2017) , when Britons voted(#included November 14 , 2017) by 52 % to 48 % to leave(#included November 14 , 2017) the world ’s largest trading(#included November 14 , 2017) bloc .
With time short to agree(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) even a bare - bones deal , economists in a Reuters poll last month said(#included Monday) there was a median 20 % chance of a disorderly departure(#included Jan. 31) at the end of the transition(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) period , during which existing(#overlap 2020-02-05 08:19:17) agreements(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) apply(#overlap 2020-02-05 08:19:17) as if Britain were still an the European Union member .
BREXIT BOUNCE ?
Johnson ’s emphatic December election(#included Monday) victory(#included Monday) stoked(#included Monday) hopes(#included Jan. 31) for a Brexit bounce(#after 2020-02-05 08:19:17) to the economy and the Bank of England said(#included Monday) on Jan. 30 a recent pick - up in growth(#included year-end) had weakened(#included year-end) the case for the Bank of England to lend(#after 2020-02-05 08:19:17) more monetary support .
“ A bounce in UK economic growth(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) helped(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) by a good - sized fiscal stimulus in Q2 remains(#overlap 2020-02-05 08:19:17) our base case , ” said(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) James McCormick , global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets .
“ our still like(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) buying(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) Sterling and the BOE ’s decision(#included January) to pass(#included January) on a cut last month ( which was a surprise to our ) has given(#included January) the sterling trend some renewed(#overlap 2020-02-05 08:19:17) momentum . ”
In contrast(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) to the Bank of England , the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank eased(#included January) policy last month .
But the coronavirus outbreak spreading further beyond China ’s borders has raised(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) more global growth(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) risks and is set(#included June 2016) to keep(#included June 2016) the U.S. dollar , which has dominated most others in foreign exchange markets for around two years , firmly on the U.S. dollar , which has dominated most others in foreign exchange markets for around two years throne well into 2020 .
With the outlook for euro zone growth(#after 2020-02-05 08:19:17) already lukewarm before the coronavirus outbreak spreading further beyond China ’s borders and no more policy changes expected(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) from the Bank of England , little movement is expected(#before 2020-02-05 08:19:17) between Sterling and Sterling .
