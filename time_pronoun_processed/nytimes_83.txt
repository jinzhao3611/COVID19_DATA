“ John Damianos first thought(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) was ‘ Oh my gosh , John Damianos must be in trouble . ’ ”
As it turned(#Depend-on 2020-05-09 10:03:26) out , Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years was n’t in trouble .
Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years was merely bored .

“ Only two of about 25 people got(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) back to Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years , my mom and John Damianos . ”
Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years met(#included September 2013) at Dartmouth in September 2013 , when Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years was a freshman and Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years a sophomore .

all the freshmen hit(#included September 2015) lunch off spectacularly and spoke(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) for hours until all the freshmen were told(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) by dining hall staff that all the freshmen had to leave(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) because it was closing(#included September 2015) time .
John Damianos later texted(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) to a friend , “ John Damianos want(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) to marry(#after 2020-05-09 10:03:26) Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years , ” Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years called(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) my mom to say(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) my mom had met(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) a “ nice Greek boy , but thought(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) a “ nice Greek boy talked(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) too much . ”

“ There were hurt(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) feelings on both sides , which Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years understood(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) , ” Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years added(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) , “ and we did n’t speak(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) to each other for two years until Vungelia Glyptis , a fellow student whom he had not talked to in two years called(#before 2020-05-09 10:03:26) John Damianos from Copenhagen . ”
