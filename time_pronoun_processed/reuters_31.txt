Oil soars(#overlap 2020-04-02 15:59:03) after Trump says(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Saudis and Russians to cut(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) output .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices soared(#included 2020-04-02) on Thursday after Trump said(#included 2020-04-02) Trump expects(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce(#after 2020-04-02 15:59:03) a major oil production cut , and Saudi state media said(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Saudi Arabia was calling(#included 2020-04-02) an emergency meeting of oil producers to deal(#included 2020-04-02) with the market turmoil .
Trump said(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Trump had spoken(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , and expects(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) oil output by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels per day , as Russia and Saudi Arabia signaled(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) willingness to make(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) a deal .
That set(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) off a swift rally in oil markets , with Brent futures soaring(#included 11:42 a.m.) $ 4.80 , or 19 % , to $ 29.56 a barrel by 11:42 a.m. EDT ( 1542 GMT ) , while U.S. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude rose $ 4.59 , or 23 % , to $ 22.55 .
Saudi Arabia was expected(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to call(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) an emergency(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
The Wall Street Journal reported(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) that Saudi Arabia would consider(#after 2020-04-02 15:59:03) dropping(#included 2020-04) output to roughly 9 million barrels per day , or about 3 million bpd less than what Saudi Arabia planned(#included 2020-04) on pumping(#included 2020-04) in April .
“ The question will come(#after 2020-04-02 15:59:03) down to , will they be able to agree(#after 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to something ?
It ’s taken(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) couple of weeks of Brent at $ 25 and WTI at $ 20 and it seems(#overlap 2020-04-02 15:59:03) as if Russians are more approachable than Russians were a month ago , ” said(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Gene McGillian , vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut .
Trump did not specify(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) that a major oil production cut referred(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to barrels per day , but barrels per day is the most common way oil markets refer(#overlap 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to supply and demand .
Earlier in the session(#included 2020-04-02) , Brent soared(#included 2020-04-02) as much as 47 % , Brent highest gain(#included 2020-04-02) ever .
WTI , meanwhile , jumped(#included 2020-04-02) as much as 35 % , which was WTI second highest ever following(#included 2020-03-19) an intraday gain(#included 2020-03-19) of 36 % on March 19 .
Oil markets have been under pressure(#included 2020-04) ever since early March , when Russia and Saudi Arabia were unable to come(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to terms on a deal to curb(#after 2020-03) production(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) , and the Saudis responded(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) by boosting(#after 2020-03) output to more than 12 million bpd and shipping(#included 2020-03-19) out cargoes worldwide at discounted prices .
Since then , the worsening(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) of the coronavirus pandemic has severely cut(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) fuel demand , pushing(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) U.S. crude as low as about $ 20 per barrel .
With fuel demand expected(#included the coming months) to fall(#included the coming months) by 20 % to 30 % in the coming months , pressure was building(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) on oil producers to come(#after 2020-04-02 15:59:03) to a deal , and Trump expressed(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) growing(#overlap 2020-04-02 15:59:03) frustration about the price of oil and oil effect on the energy industry .
Trump is meeting(#included 2020-04-03) with major energy chief executives at the White House on Friday .

a major oil production cut would be unprecedented , and would likely need(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) the participation of numerous countries outside of OPEC and OPEC allies .
Texas regulators are exploring(#overlap 2020-04-02 15:59:03) the possibility of cutting(#included the coming months) production(#overlap 2020-04-02 15:59:03) in Texas .
“ It ’s one thing to send(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) optimistic tweets and quite another to coordinate(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) actual production(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) cuts(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) when Russia dragged(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Russia feet throughout the OPEC+ era and the U.S. has(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) no controlling authority to implement(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) production limits , ” said(#before 2020-04-02 15:59:03) Sandy Fielden , director of oil and products research at Morningstar in Austin , Texas .
