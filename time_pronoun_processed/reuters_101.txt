The Governors and Heads of Supervision ( GHOS ) , the body that oversees the Basel Committee of global banking regulators , said(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) The Governors and Heads of Supervision ( GHOS ) , the body that oversees the Basel Committee of global banking regulators , was deferring(#before January 2023) several rules until January 2023 .
“ It is important that banks and supervisors are able to commit(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) banks and supervisors full resources to respond(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) to the impact(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) of Covid-19 , ” said(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) François Villeroy de Galhau , Chairman of the GHOS and Governor of the Bank of France .
“ The measures(#included today) endorsed(#included today) by the GHOS today aim(#included today) to prioritise(#included today) these objectives and The Governors and Heads of Supervision ( GHOS ) , the body that oversees the Basel Committee of global banking regulators , remain(#included today) ready to act(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) further if necessary . ”
François Villeroy de Galhau , Chairman of the GHOS and Governor of the Bank of France said(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) banks needed(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) to commit(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) all banks resources during the coronavirus epidemic to helping(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) the economy and ensuring(#overlap 2020-03-27 16:10:11) that the banking system remains(#overlap 2020-03-27 16:10:11) financially and operationally resilient .
After taxpayers had to bail(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) out undercapitalized lenders in the financial crisis(#included July 18 , 2019) a decade ago , the Basel Committee of global banking regulators toughened(#included July 18 , 2019) the Basel Committee of global banking regulators rules under a reform known as Basel III .
Most of a reform known as Basel III has been implemented(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) , but some remaining elements were agreed(#included December 2017) in December 2017 and due to be introduced(#included December 2017) in January 2022 .
some remaining elements include(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) a revised(#included 2020-04-03) leverage ratio , changes to models used(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) by big banks to work(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) out how much capital big banks should hold(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) , and changes to how much capital to hold(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) against trading(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) book assets like derivatives .
The “ output floor ” or minimum capital requirements irrespective of what an internal model comes up with , has also been delayed(#included December 2017) a year to January 2023 .
The “ output floor ” or minimum capital requirements irrespective of what an internal model comes up with are meant(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) to complement(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) the initial set of a reform known as Basel III rules that are already in force(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) without significantly increasing(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) overall capital requirements .
“ The revised timeline is therefore not expected(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) to dilute(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) the capital strength of the banking system , but will provide(#overlap 2020-03-27 16:10:11) banks and supervisors additional capacity to respond(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) immediately and effectively to the impact(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) of Covid-19 , ” the GHOS said(#included 2020-04-03) in the GHOS statement(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) .
Regulators in Europe have faced(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) heavy lobbying(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) by banks to water(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) down the rules as the European Union looks(#overlap 2020-03-27 16:10:11) to put(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) the rules into EU law .
But the GHOS said(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) its members , which include the European Central Bank that regulates top euro zone lenders , unanimously reaffirmed(#included 2020-04-03) its members , which include the European Central Bank that regulates top euro zone lenders , expectation of “ full , timely and consistent implementation(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) ” of all the a reform known as Basel III standards based(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) on The revised timeline .
“ Current events demonstrate(#included Current) once again the importance of a resilient financial system , which these reforms(#included today) will help(#after 2020-03-27 16:10:11) further reinforce(#included Current) , ” the GHOS said(#before 2020-03-27 16:10:11) .
