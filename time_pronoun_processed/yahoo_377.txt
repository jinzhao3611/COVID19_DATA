What's happening(#included this year) in market sentiment is a 'healthy situation': strategist .
2020-02-20 19:00:40 +00:00 .
So far this year , 2020-02-20 has n’t taken(#included this year) much of a blow to knock(#included this year) investor sentiment back down after bubbling(#included this year) up – and taken ’s a good sign for stocks , according to at least one strategist .
“ Recently , you did start(#included Recently) to see(#included Recently) some real extremes in terms of optimism , particularly in behavioral measures of investor sentiment in mid - January , ” Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , told(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) Yahoo Finance on The Ticker .
“ And then you got(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) that kind of knocked(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) down a bit with the onset(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) of the coronavirus . ”
The S&P 500 pulled(#included mid - January) back just over 3 % between Jan. 17 and Jan. 31 as coronavirus cases escalated(#included this year) , unwinding(#included this year) some of the index ’s year - to - date gains(#included this year) and briefly turning(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) The S&P 500 negative on an intraday basis .
While ultimately short - lived , unwinding acted(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) as a reset(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) button on investor optimism .
bringing(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) sentiment measures(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) back down “ at worst to neutral , ” Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , said(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
“ What Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , think is unique in this recent period of time is , it does n’t take(#overlap 2020-02-20 19:00:40) much of a pullback in the market to bring(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) back some of that euphoria , ” Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , said(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
“ And Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , think(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) that has been , at least in the near - term , a stabilizing(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) force . ”
A quick recalibration(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) in investor sentiment has been a hallmark of trading(#included this year) over much of the past decade , with optimism remaining(#included this year) well - contained(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) even amid a steady march higher in The S&P 500 , Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , said(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
“ Sentiment ’s been an interesting animal really in the market , arguably up until the beginning of 2018 , ” Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , said(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
“ Sentiment really never got(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) to anything resembling euphoria , which Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , think(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) is one of the reasons why this recent period of time has been such an elongated(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) bull market .
this recent period of time ’s been climbing(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) that wall of worry(#overlap 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
There was sort of the default position of skepticism . ”
For a brief period in 2018 , climbing did start(#included 2018) to shift(#included 2018) , however .
The The S&P 500 ’s 19 % return(#included 2017) in 2017 coincided(#included 2017) with a record - low year for volatility , pushing(#included 2018) investor sentiment higher through the start of 2018 .
pushing reversed(#included February 2018) in February 2018 when the Cboe Volatility Index , a widely tracked gauge of near - term volatility for The S&P 500 , skyrocketed(#included February 2018) to a more than two - year high of 50.3 before sharply receding(#included February 2018) to 24.4 , roiling(#included February 2018) market participants that had bet against volatility .
Signals of a repeat of that incidence , however , appear to be off the table for now , according to Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , .
And indeed , last week when The S&P 500 rose(#included last week) 1.6 % , investors returned(#included last week) to net selling(#included last week) after four straight weeks of buying(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) , according to a report(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) from Bank of America , indicating(#included last week) an absence of overwhelming exuberance as buying(#included last week) cooled(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
“ Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , ’d rather have(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) it be that way than , say(#included February 2018) , in the late 1990s , where no matter what the news was , no matter what the market did , investors were in that euphoric mode , ” Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , said(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
That time , that euphoria ultimately led(#included February 2018) to the dot - com crash(#included February 2018) at the turn of the century .
“ That time is different .
That time ’s a new paradigm , ” Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab , said(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) .
“ So that skepticism that comes(#before 2020-02-20 19:00:40) back more quickly is actually a relatively healthy situation . ”
