TOKYO , March 11 ( Reuters ) - Nine years after Japan ’s 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster , the government ’s handling of the coronavirus epidemic shows(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) the government remains(#overlap 2020-03-11 13:30:48) hamstrung in responding(#overlap 2020-03-11 13:30:48) to crises , the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident chaired(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission , which determined(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) that Japan ’s 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster was manmade due to regulatory failures and deficiencies(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) in the government response(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
A similar scenario is playing(#included now) out now with a lack of leadership in parliament and a bureaucracy that can not adapt(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) to unforeseen crises , the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) in an interview(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) with Reuters .
“ Unless it ’s written(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) in law , their brains are paralyzed(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) when something happens(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) , ” said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident .
The March 11 , 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered(#included March 11 , 2011) the world ’s worst nuclear accident(#included March 11 , 2011) since Chernobyl at the Tokyo Electric Power Co ’s Fukushima Daiichi plant , 220 km ( 130 miles ) northeast of Tokyo .
Critics have accused(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of an initial lack of leadership and then over - abrupt actions to stem(#overlap 2020-03-11 13:30:48) the coronavirus epidemic , such as school closures that left(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) parents and employers scrambling(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
Japan has reported(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) 1,278 cases of coronavirus and 19 deaths(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
parliament is set(#included this week) this week to amend(#included this week) a law that would allow Abe to declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus if needed .
Such a law should be buttressed(#after 2020-03-11 13:30:48) by know(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) - how and preparedness on the part of the civil service , the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
“ To make(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) a law that would allow Abe to declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus if needed effective , you have to practice(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) certain things , like with -Fukushima and infectious disease , ” the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
“ But how to do a law that would allow Abe to declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus if needed in an emergency ?
the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident think(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) Japanese bureaucrats have(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) no experience . ”
One sore point is Japan ’s relatively low amount of testing(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) for coronavirus .
The health ministry has built(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) up The health ministry testing(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) capacity to more than 6,000 daily but is averaging(#overlap 2020-03-11 13:30:48) only about 900 exams per day .
By comparison(#overlap 2020-03-11 13:30:48) , South Korea , with at least 7,755 known infections and 63 deaths(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) , has implemented(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) drive - through exams and tested(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) about 200,000 people related to an outbreak(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) at a church .
Health Ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara defended(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) the Japan ’s response , telling(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) a press briefing(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) that the government was trying(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) to prevent(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) patients “ rushing(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) into hospitals ” and disabling(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) patients ability to deal(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) with severe cases .
the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) Japan could allay(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) concerns about the Japan ’s response by increasing(#overlap 2020-03-11 13:30:48) transparency and letting(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) any concerned(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) patients be tested(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
“ Any patient who comes to the doctor , if Any patient who comes to the doctor have(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) a reasonable suspicion ( of having(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) coronavirus ) , and Any patient who comes to the doctor want(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) this testing , just do this testing , ” the head of the commission that investigated the Fukushima accident said(#before 2020-03-11 13:30:48) .
“ And what is the price ?
That comes(#included 2006) later anyway . ”
