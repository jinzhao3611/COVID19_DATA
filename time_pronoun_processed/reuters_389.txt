NEGATIVE RATES ?
The market has started(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) to price(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) in the possibility of negative interest rates .
A Bank of England rate - setter , Silvana Tenreyro , said(#included Monday) on Monday that Bank of England has not ruled(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) out negative interest rates .
ruled added(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) to speculation(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) after the bank ’s chief economist , Andy Haldane , said(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) negative rates were being looked(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) at more urgently .
But many analysts think(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) Bank of England is unlikely to bring(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) in negative rates and is more likely to add(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) to Bank of England quantitative easing programme(#overlap 2020-05-19 14:55:52) .
Commerzbank ’s Nguyen said(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) that if Bank of England introduced(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) negative rates by a 25 basis points cut(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) , the effect on The pound would be limited(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) , whereas a cutting(#before 2020-05-19 14:55:52) cycle would have(#after 2020-05-19 14:55:52) more impact .
