2020-05-21 06:13:31 +00:00 .
( Bloomberg ) -- Asian data laid(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) bare the extent of damage(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) to global trade(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) with no clear sign that the worst is over even as the world takes(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) tentative steps toward reopening(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) .
An early trade(#included May.) report(#included May.) from South Korea , a bellwether for global commerce , showed(#included May) exports may be set(#included May) to drop(#included May) more than 20 % in May for a second month .
Meanwhile , Japan ’s overseas shipments also plunged(#included 2020-04) by more than a fifth in April and a purchasing managers index showed(#included May) manufacturing activity weakening(#included 2020-04) further in May.
The data showed(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) plunging(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) exports of cars and auto parts to be the biggest drag on trade as the pandemic hobbles(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) vehicle demand in the U.S. and Europe .
Still , the value of semiconductor shipments from both Japan and Korea increased(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) , and falls(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) in exports to China moderated(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) .
” We have yet to confirm(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the bottom with economic data , but the global economy is heading(#overlap 2020-05-21 06:13:31) for bottoming(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) out with lockdowns(#included 2020-04) being lifted(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) , ” said(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) economist Masaki Kuwahara at Nomura Securities in Tokyo .
“ Economic activity is resuming(#included May.) bit by bit . ”
To be sure , Thursday ’s data showed(#included Thursday) Japan ’s PMI for the services sector ticking(#included 2020-04) up , albeit from a record low , with government last week lifting(#included last week) government state of emergency(#included last week) for most of China ’s rural prefectures , where there have been few new infections in recent days .
“ The dynamics in the global economy are clearly evolving(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) , ” said(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) economist Joe Hayes at IHS Markit , which compiles(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the au Jibun Bank Japan PMI survey .
“ As Japan eases(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the state of emergency(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) measures(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) , the global economy can begin(#after 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the global economy gradual recovery . ”
Japanese Manufacturing PMI Drops Further on Virus Hit
But manufacturing and trade data from the region suggests(#overlap 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the worst is not over for the global slump .
The au Jibun Bank Japan purchasing(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) managers index for manufacturing fell(#included May) to 38.4 in May , indicating(#included 2020-04) the strongest contraction(#after 2009) of activity in the services sector since March 2009 .
A separate report(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) from Japan showed(#included 2020-04) exports fell(#included 2020-04) about 22 % in April , with vehicle shipments dropping(#included 2020-04) by half .
Japan ’s Exports Fall(#included 2020-04) in April Most Since March 2009
Amid Coronavirus Shock
Economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo said(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) The data confirms(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) Japan ’s economy is rapidly worsening(#overlap 2020-05-21 06:13:31) and Economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo sees(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the global slump deepening(#after 2009) for another month or two before picking(#included 2020-04) up .
“ Make(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) no mistake , ” Economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo said(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) .
“ It will take(#after 2020-05-21 06:13:31) a long while to get(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) back to where we were before the pandemic . ”
One market showing(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) signs of recovery is China , where the pandemic ’s earliest outbreak(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) has been contained(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) and factories are getting(#overlap 2020-05-21 06:13:31) back to work(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) .
Thursday ’s reports(#included Thursday) showed(#included Thursday) both Japanese and South Korean exports to China falling(#included Thursday) far less than shipments to other key markets , but there ’s a risk that collapsing(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) global demand could squash(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) Japan ’s rebound .
Korea Early Exports Data Signal Dismal Drop for Global Trade

Declines(#included 2020-04) in average daily shipments widened(#included 2020-04) from 16.8 % in April .
“ Double - digit exports decline(#after 2020-05-21 06:13:31) will last(#after 2020-05-21 06:13:31) for at least a couple more months , ” said(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) So Jaeyong , an economist at Shinhan Bank .
“ the U.S. restarting(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) the U.S. economy after China may provide(#before 2020-05-21 06:13:31) a floor to the global slump , but there are multiple risks ahead , including(#overlap 2020-05-21 06:13:31) a wider second wave of infections . ”
