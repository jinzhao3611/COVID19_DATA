2020-03-20 22:45:38 +00:00 .
Andy Carroll has had(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) no shortage of criticism(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) over the years – some of it deserved(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) – but George Ramshaw refuses(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) to hear(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) a bad word about the Newcastle United striker .
A fortnight before football ’s coronavirus - induced shutdown(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) , the Newcastle United striker returned(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) to work(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) at the club ’s training ground with a spring in the Newcastle United striker step .
Thanks to a whip - round of Steve Bruce ’s first - teamers , initiated(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) by Andy Carroll , George Ramshaw had(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) a new hip .
After raising(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) around £ 15,000 to fund(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) the Newcastle United striker surgery at a private hospital on Tyneside , the players were delighted(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) to see(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) the Newcastle United striker back .
George Ramshaw is coy about George Ramshaw age – “ let ’s just say(#overlap 2020-03-20 22:45:38) George Ramshaw ’m a pensioner , ” is how George Ramshaw puts(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) it
– but the Newcastle United striker is believed(#included over the years) to be in the Newcastle United striker 70s .
“ the Newcastle United striker has been here since the year dot , ” said(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) Newcastle ’s manager .
“ the players paid(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) for his hip operation .
his hip operation was a lovely touch(#included these) .
Footballers get(#overlap 2020-03-20 22:45:38) much maligned(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) these days but Footballers sent(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) the Newcastle United striker off to get(#included these) his hip operation done privately .
I think(#included these) it might have been Andy Carroll ’s initial idea .
Andy Carroll , of course , has known(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) the Newcastle United striker for a long time .
“ He ’d only just come(#included the past couple of weeks) back to work(#included these) in the past couple of weeks and the Newcastle United striker ’s all fixed(#included the past couple of weeks) and healed(#included the past couple of weeks) .
It seems(#included these) to have been a big success .
We were all thrilled(#included these) to see(#included these) the Newcastle United striker back because the Newcastle United striker is a lovely , lovely man .
the Newcastle United striker ’s as good as gold now .
Before We closed(#included the) down the Newcastle United striker was jumping(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) around the place ; I thought(#included the) He ’d be playing(#included these) soon . ”
There was a time when the Newcastle United striker might have given(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) Carroll and company a run for Carroll and company money .
George Ramshaw was a leading(#included these) amateur player , who starred(#included 1950s) for the immensely successful non - league Whitley Bay side of the 1950s and 1960s .
During the 1960s George Ramshaw also represented(#included the) the Great Britain amateur side , variously touring(#included the) and playing(#included the) in Zambia , Tanzania , Uganda and Iceland and the former Rhodesia .
After hanging(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) up George Ramshaw boots George Ramshaw moved(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) into coaching and became(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) assistant manager at Gateshead before joining(#included 1995) Kevin Keegan ’s Newcastle in 1995 as assistant kit manager , looking(#included 1995) after the reserves .
“ I ’m eternally grateful(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) to the players
, ” said(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) George Ramshaw from George Ramshaw home in Hebburn .
“ I was in a lot of pain with I hip and it would have been months before I could get(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) an operation through the NHS given(#overlap 2020-03-20 22:45:38) how busy the players are .
“ the players said(#included the) : ‘ Can the players do something ? ’ to our club doctor , Paul Catterson , and our club doctor , Paul Catterson put(#before 2020-03-20 22:45:38) something in motion with the Nuffield .
