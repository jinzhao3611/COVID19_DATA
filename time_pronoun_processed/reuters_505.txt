“ The United Kingdom can not impose(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) this very short calendar for negotiations(#after 2020-04-24 15:28:08) and at the same time not move(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) , not progress(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) on certain subjects that are important for the European Union , ” Michel Barnier , Brexit chief negotiator for Europe on future ties with Britain , said(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) .
the Brexit transition period could be extended(#after 2020-04-24 15:28:08) by a year or two , but Britain would have to request(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) the Brexit transition period by the end of June .

“ Britain need(#Depend-on 2020-04-24 15:28:08) to make(#after 2020-04-24 15:28:08) progress on all issues in parallel .
Britain need(#Depend-on 2020-04-24 15:28:08) to find(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) solutions for the most difficult topics .
Britain can not refuse(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) to extend(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) the Brexit transition period and at the same time slow(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) down discussions(#overlap 2020-04-24 15:28:08) on important areas , ” Michel Barnier , Brexit chief negotiator for Europe on future ties with Britain , said(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) .

the European Union wants(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) a single framework to oversee(#after 2020-04-24 15:28:08) all areas , while Britain wants(#overlap 2020-04-24 15:28:08) separate agreements(#after 2020-04-24 15:28:08) with separate arrangements , Michel Barnier , Brexit chief negotiator for Europe on future ties with Britain , said(#before 2020-04-24 15:28:08) .
