REUTERS / Denis Balibouse The nightly 6 pm “ choir ” at the 1920s block , a 6 - storey architectural monument built(#included 1920s) in a semi - circle , has become(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) a way to cheer(#included 6 pm) each other up during Switzerland ’s national lockdown to stop(#after 2020-04-29 11:10:10) the spread of COVID-19 , now in its seventh week .
“ There is music , it swings(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) , that ’s a good thing , ” said(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) Daniele Salins , a 75 - year - old resident who joined(#included Tuesday evening) in the dancing(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) .
“ It feels(#included 1920s) good , It takes(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) our mind off our problems , otherwise , if you look(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) at the news , It ’s very exhausting(#overlap 2020-04-29 11:10:10) . ”
The tradition started(#included mid - March) in mid - March when Switzerland ’s national lockdown began(#included mid - March) and residents sing(#included 1920s) and dance(#included 1920s) to a handful of songs every night except Sundays , taking(#included 1920s) turns to choose(#included 1920s) the music .

The dozens of kids in the building look(#overlap 2020-04-29 11:10:10) forward to the evening “ show(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) ” and passers - by stop and watch(#overlap 2020-04-29 11:10:10) with kids and dogs .
“ The children , who ca n’t play(#overlap 2020-04-29 11:10:10) with each other , The dozens of kids in the building at least get(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) to see(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) each other , ” said(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) Tessa , a resident and 39 - year - old speech therapist and mother of two young boys .

“ It has become(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) more and more magical as time has passed(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) . ”
Residents say(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) Residents want(#Depend-on 2020-04-29 11:10:10) to continue(#after 2020-04-29 11:10:10) The choir after lockdown(#included this month) ends(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) .
The tentative end date is May 11 when schools resume(#included May 11) .
“ We are thinking(#after 2020-04-29 11:10:10) of keeping(#after 2020-04-29 11:10:10) The choir as a ritual(#included this month) every Sunday , ” said(#before 2020-04-29 11:10:10) Marion , a resident and mother .
