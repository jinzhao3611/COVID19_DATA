“ Large events and mass gatherings can contribute(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) Large events and mass gatherings and introduce(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) the virus to new communities , ” the recommendation read(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) .

Commissioner Adam Silver suspended(#included last week) the NBA ’s season and placed(#included last week) NBA on a 30 - day hiatus last week , while noting(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) that the National Basketball Players Association and the league ’s television partners shared(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) a desire(#Depend-on 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to resume(#included later this summer) the schedule later this summer if possible .
a 30 - day hiatus has now been effectively extended(#included now) to May 15 in light of the recommendation .
extended could have(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) wide - reaching logistical ramifications for individual NBA teams , who are awaiting(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) guidance(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) from the league office on next steps .
Before the coronavirus crisis , non - playoff teams were anticipating(#included April 15) that non - playoff teams seasons would end(#included April 15) on May 15 .
The CDC ’s two - month stoppage would theoretically require(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) teams to keep(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) teams players in market for a month past the standard conclusion(#included April 15) of the regular season without any guarantee that games would be able to resume(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , with or without fans in attendance(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) .
Most NBA players have returned(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to Most NBA players team ’s home cities , but have(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) family and other obligations elsewhere .
NBA teams have also been advised(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to hold(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) individual workouts rather than team practices(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , which has left(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) players in professional limbo and could keep(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) players away from players families for at least two months .
These complexities led(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) two high - ranking team executives , who both spoke(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) on the condition of anonymity , to predict(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) that NBA would be forced(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to cancel(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) the balance of the regular season and drastically alter(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) the upcoming(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) Draft Combine , set(#included April 15) for May 21 - 24 in Chicago .
In a sign of how quickly the coronavirus crisis has evolved(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , Commissioner Adam Silver floated(#included April 15) a possible four - week shutdown(#included April 15) as recently as Thursday .
“ Even if we ’re out for a month or out for six weeks , we could still restart(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) the season , ” Commissioner Adam Silver said(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) in an interview(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) with TNT .
“ It might mean(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) that the Finals take(#included later this summer) place in late - July . ”
take would be rendered(#Depend-on 2020-03-16 02:11:23) impossible by the CDC recommendations(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , which are meant(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to help(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) in slowing(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) the spread of the coronavirus by encouraging(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) social distancing .
Given(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) these new calendar challenges(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , multiple high - ranking executives said(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) NBA would likely turn(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) NBA attention to salvaging(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) NBA postseason .
Potential measures(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to save(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) the Finals
, some executives said(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , could include(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) pushing(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) back the start date to June , playing(#included late - July) games in empty arenas , eliminating(#included late - July) extra rest days between games(#included late - July) , cutting(#included late - July) down the 16 - team field or hosting(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) a single - site tournament(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) to reduce(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) travel(#after 2020-03-16 02:11:23) between multiple markets .
“ the Finals are in jeopardy(#overlap 2020-03-16 02:11:23) , ” one high - ranking team executive said(#before 2020-03-16 02:11:23) .
