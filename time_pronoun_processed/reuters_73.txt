CAPE TOWN , March 31 ( Reuters ) - Player salaries for the South African 2020 - 21 cricket season are safe , but the long - term effects of the coronavirus pandemic could mean(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) the country ’s cricketers earn(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) less in the future , Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul has said .
A number of sports teams and organisations around the world have either reduced(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) the salaries of players and officials , or cut(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) A number of sports teams and organisations around the world staff numbers in the wake of the virus outbreak(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) that has crippled(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) global sport .
Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul said(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) CSA , who contract(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) players on a yearly basis , will not follow(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) suit , but believed(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) the longer - term prospects for player income is of great concern .
“ We have budgeted(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) for the amount .
the amount is a centralised system and both the national team and franchise players are budgeted(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) for , ” Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul told(#included 2020-03-31) local media on Tuesday .
“ At this stage We will have(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) enough capacity to see(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) We through the season .
“ But in the long term , even if We cover(#included this) the season , We will have to look(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) at what the situation is going(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) to be after that and the financial impact the situation has(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) .
“ In the situation , Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul can not see(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) any player getting(#included currently) less money the season , but going(#included this) forward Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul can see(#included this) a situation where players might have to receive(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) less . ”
Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul added(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) they are currently undertaking(#included currently) scenario planning(#included currently) based(#included currently) on the impact(#included currently) of no cricket for the next three , six or nine months .
“ How much will be available to pay(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) players ( next season ) ?
We need(#included this) to see(#overlap 2020-03-31 12:11:40) the total effect of Covid-19 .
And of course , players right now miss(#included PRESENT_REF) out on appearance fees and win(#included PRESENT_REF) bonuses , ” Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul said(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) .
“ If we have(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) series postponed and series are played(#included this) at a later date , then players can make(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) series up .
If not , that is lost(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) income . ”
Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul conceded(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) that in a worst - case scenario , where international cricket can not be played(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) for two or three seasons , the game could become(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) a recreational sport in South Africa .
“ You must evaluate(#included currently) every resource the available now , and how far will every resource stretch(#after 2020-03-31 12:11:40) .
If we run(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) out of capacity to run(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) cricket in the country then cricket becomes(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) a recreational sport , ” Cricket South Africa Acting CEO Jacques Faul said(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) .
“ cricket has got(#before 2020-03-31 12:11:40) us all nervous and it ( the coronavirus ) is a big concern(#overlap 2020-03-31 12:11:40) .
But health is the most important thing .
Sport feeds(#overlap 2020-03-31 12:11:40) a lot of people , but we must be honest that the world has(#overlap 2020-03-31 12:11:40) even bigger challenges(#overlap 2020-03-31 12:11:40) at the moment . ”
South Africa ’s next scheduled(#included right) international assignment(#included late July) is a test and limited overs tour(#included late July) of the West Indies starting(#included late July) in late July .
