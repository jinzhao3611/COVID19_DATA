UK coronavirus death(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) toll rises(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) above 32,000 to highest in Europe .
2020-05-05 09:56:45 +00:00 .
UK now has(#included PRESENT_REF) the highest death toll in Europe from coronavirus after new official figures revealed(#included PRESENT_REF) that more than 32,000 people have died(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) from coronavirus .
The Office for National Statistics said(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) 29,648 deaths(#included 27 April) had taken(#included 27 April) place by 27 April in England and Wales with Covid-19 mentioned(#included 27 April) in death(#included 27 April) certificates .
With the addition(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) of deaths(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) in England and Northern Ireland , said takes(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) the UK ’s death toll to 32,313 , according to calculations(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) by Reuters .
the UK ’s death toll far exceeds(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) the death(#included PRESENT_REF) toll of 29,029 in Italy – until now Europe ’s worst - hit country .
Italy ’s total does not include(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) suspected(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) cases .
Ministers and experts have warned(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) against international comparisons(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) , saying(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) the figure for excess mortality – the number of deaths(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) from all causes that exceed(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) the average for the time of year – is a more meaningful gauge .
The latest ONS figures for the week ending 24 April show(#included 24 April) there were 21,997 deaths(#included 24 April) , which is 11,539 more than the average for the week ending 24 April .
But the UK ’s death toll dipped(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) slightly by 354 death .
dipped was the first decrease(#included last week) in weekly deaths(#included that) since the start of the outbreak and confirms(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) other figures showing(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) UK is past the peak of infections .
The latest ONS figures for the week ending 24 April also show(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) that while hospital deaths(#included 24 April) increased(#included 27 April) at a slower rate in the week ending 24 April than the previous week , deaths(#included 24 April) in care homes continued(#included the previous week) to increase(#included the previous week) by 595 to 7,911 .
For the first time the previous week , the government began(#included last week) including(#included last week) data on deaths(#included last week) outside hospitals in cases where people had tested(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) positive for coronavirus , in the daily death toll figures for coronavirus .
By contrast The latest ONS figures for the week ending 24 April include(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) all deaths(#included last week) where Covid-19 is mentioned(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) on death(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) certificates .
Italy quickly became(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) a centre of the outbreak , with the first deaths(#included late February) in late February , and was the first European country to move(#included late February) into lockdown(#included last week) .
As the UK ’s death toll rose(#included last week) , so too did(#included last week) the number of articles unpicking(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) what went(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) wrong .
Italy ’s large ageing population , culture of close social interactions and densely populated cities , as well as a lack of time to prepare(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) and a slow initial response(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) to coronavirus are among the reasons(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) cited(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) as why Italy was so badly hit(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) .
UK , it was said(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) , should learn(#overlap 2020-05-05 09:56:45) from Italy .
But now , it seems(#included PRESENT_REF) , UK could be as badly struck(#before 2020-05-05 09:56:45) .
