Benzinga ’s Take
It seems(#overlap 2020-05-29 17:56:34) GE ’s financial situation is far better than GE ’s financial situation has been in recent years , and GE ’s balance sheet is stable and flexible enough to endure(#included PRESENT_REF) yet another difficult year .
However , GE investors are likely growing(#before 2020-05-29 17:56:34) tired(#before 2020-05-29 17:56:34) of hearing(#before 2020-05-29 17:56:34) about how a turnaround is just around the corner after years of underperformance and lackluster FCF and earnings numbers .
