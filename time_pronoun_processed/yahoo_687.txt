The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise is still on for mid-August .
Since the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance was just canceled(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) the other day due to coronavirus , we decided(#included summer) to check(#included summer) in on the hugely popular Michigan summer event for car enthusiasts .
The two events typically run(#included August) on the same weekend in mid-August , and this year was no different .
Pebble was scheduled(#included Sunday , August 16) for Sunday , August 16 , and The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise is still scheduled(#included Saturday , August 15) for Saturday , August 15 .
The Detroit Free Press initially reported(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) the news .
Michael Lary , Dream Cruise president confirmed(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) to we that the hugely popular Michigan summer event for car enthusiasts is still on .
“ As we all go(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) about making(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) the necessary and current adjustments to protect(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) public health through social distancing , The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise is continuing(#included August) as planned(#included August) in mid-August , ” Michael Lary , Dream Cruise president says(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) .
Of course , The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise is a vastly different event than the Pebble Beach Concours .
Owners have to make(#after 2020-04-24 18:48:42) preparations months in advance to ship(#after 2020-04-24 18:48:42) Owners cars to Monterey from all over the place .
Folks in Michigan simply have to leave(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) Folks in Michigan garage and mosey(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) on over to Woodward Ave .
However , The two events end(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) up gathering(#included summer) huge numbers of people in one area , which would raise(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) anybody ’s alarm bells these days .
we asked(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) if there were any restrictions(#included August) that are currently being considered(#included August) for The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise , but Michael Lary , Dream Cruise president did n’t define(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) any for the time being .
we do n’t exactly know(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) what the world is going(#included mid - August right now) to look(#included mid - August right now) like in mid - August right now anyways .
“ Please know(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) that we are working(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) to deliver(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) the same caliber of family - fun activities that you have come(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) to expect(#included mid - August right now) for the past twenty - five years , ” Michael Lary , Dream Cruise president told(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) we .
“ The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise continues(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) to rely(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) on the strong relationships we have(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) with cruisers , sponsors , exhibitors , spectators , and enthusiasts , to provide(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) another celebration(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) of all things automotive . ”
we 've asked(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise sponsors and partners , including(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) Ford ( the presenting(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) sponsor ) , for comment(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) and will update(#included August) when we hear(#included Saturday) back .
There ’s every chance this news could end(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) up flipping(#included mid - August right now) at a later date , but organizers of the hugely popular Michigan summer event for car enthusiasts are plowing(#included August) full steam ahead for the time being .
Even if the official day and events surrounding(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) the hugely popular Michigan summer event for car enthusiasts are canceled(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) , The 2020 Woodward Dream Cruise is far more than just the one Saturday .
Cruisers are traditionally out(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) for weeks to months before the hugely popular Michigan summer event for car enthusiasts , taking(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) laps of Woodward Ave for fun .
Mini car meets(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) sprout(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) up along the roadside parking lots .
The spontaneous and public - driven nature of the hugely popular Michigan summer event for car enthusiasts ” makes(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) we wonder(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) what a Dream Cruise with coronavirus would even look(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) like .
Cruisers keeping(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) to Cruisers in Cruisers cars does n’t sound(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) particularly dangerous for spreading(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) the disease .
But spectators and crowded parking lots sound(#overlap 2020-04-24 18:48:42) like an anxiety - inducing nightmare .
That said(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) , the state of the world in mid-August will likely be the deciding(#included mid-August) factor .
Do we have(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) a full Dream Cruise ?
Or a Dream Cruise with heavy restrictions(#before 2020-04-24 18:48:42) ?
Or no a full Dream Cruise at all ?
