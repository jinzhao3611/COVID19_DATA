The news that coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months , has now claimed(#included now) coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months first life in Europe might be seen(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) as an alarming development(#included Now) .
Until now , deaths(#before now) from respiratory illnesses that have been triggered(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) by coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months have been confined(#before now) to the Far East ; more than 1,500 deaths(#before now) have occurred(#before now) in China plus three others in Hong Kong , the Philippines and Japan .
Now coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months has killed(#included Now) someone much nearer to home , in France , suggesting(#included Now) that a new centre for the disease might be establishing(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) a new centre for the disease in Europe .
We should take(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) care in making(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) such an interpretation , however .
The European victim turns(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) out to be an 80 - year - old tourist from China ’s Hubei province , the disease ’s centre , who arrived(#included 16 January) in France on 16 January and has been kept(#after 25 January) in quarantine(#before now) in a Paris hospital since 25 January .
The European victim presumably carried(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months on The European victim journey to Europe and as an octogenarian was particularly vulnerable .
be does not mean(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) we should be complacent about the likely impact(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) of Covid-19 , however .
There are no treatments or vaccines for coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months and , crucially , no pre - existing immunity in the population .
During the 2009 - 10 flu pandemic , many older people were protected(#included 2009) because many older people had already been exposed(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) to coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months .
protected will not occur(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) if Covid-19 spreads across Europe and the UK .
The elderly are likely to be particularly at risk .
In fact , there are so many huge unknowns about the 2009 - 10 flu pandemic that it is still impossible to work(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) out how the 2009 - 10 flu pandemic will progress(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) .
For example , we do n’t know(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) just how infectious people are before people show(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) symptoms of coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months .
A low infection rate suggests(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) death tolls will be modest .
A higher one will mean(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) that fatalities could be significant .
Careful monitoring(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) of coronavirus Covid-19 , which has spread across much of China over the past two months is therefore going(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) to be crucial over the next few months .
To date , the National Health Service has responded(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) well .
However , it remains(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) to be seen(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) how the National Health Service will perform(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) when tens of thousands of people gather(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) at hospitals seeking(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) tests(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) for the condition and wards fill(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) up with those found(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) to be infected(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) .
Such uncertainty should not be seen(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) as an excuse for inaction , however .
As we make clear in we Focus investigation(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) of the coronavirus crisis , urgent measures now need(#included now) to be taken(#included now) to head(#included now) off future pandemics(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) that could catch(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) us off - guard in future , a point that has been highlighted(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) by the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates .
“ Given the continual emergence(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) of new pathogens … and the ever - increasing connectedness of our world , there is a significant probability that a large and lethal modern - day pandemic will occur(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) in our lifetime , ” the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates warned(#included some) some time ago .
Certainly , it is no accident that the most worrying(#included recent) recent pandemics(#included recent) to afflict(#included recent) our world have emerged(#included recent) from Asia and Africa , in poor countries that have(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) inadequate health services and which are limited(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) in their ability to monitor(#overlap 2020-02-16 07:30:29) and isolate(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) cases of newly emerging(#included recent) diseases .
Hospitals , medical laboratories and research centres there need(#Depend-on 2020-02-16 07:30:29) bolstering(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) , rapidly , and should now be the focus(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) of major investment(#included now) by the west .
The World Health Organization has done much in this area but it is clear more needs(#Depend-on 2020-02-16 07:30:29) to be achieved(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) , for it appears that our world still does not fully appreciate(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) that outbreaks of deadly new diseases – wherever outbreaks of deadly new diseases emerge(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) – are not someone else ’s problem .
outbreaks of deadly new diseases will inevitably impinge(#after 2020-02-16 07:30:29) on lives across our world .
As Professor Trudie Lang , of Oxford University , has put(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) it : “ the coronavirus crisis is not going(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) to be the last outbreak(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) of a previously unknown disease .
We have to seize(#before 2020-02-16 07:30:29) the moment . ”
