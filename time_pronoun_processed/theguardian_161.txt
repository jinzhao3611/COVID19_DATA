Germans urged(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to stay(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) home amid Covid-19 infection rate fears(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
2020-04-28 16:49:48 +00:00 .
Germans have been advised(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to stay(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) at home as much as possible and continue(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to apply(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) physical distancing as official data appeared(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to indicate(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic was once again accelerating(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
The basic reproduction(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) number ( R ) , indicating(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) how many new cases one infected person generates(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) on average
, has come(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to be seen(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) as the key indicator over whether restrictions(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) on public life can be loosened(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) after Angela Merkel stressed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the importance of keeping(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the number below one .
On Tuesday , the German government ’s disease control agency , the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , announced(#included Tuesday) the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had risen(#included Monday 27 April) to 1 , after having put(#included mid - April) the reproduction number for Monday 27 April as low as 0.7 in mid - April .
Lothar Wieler , the RKI ’s president , later specified(#included Monday) that the reproduction(#included Monday) rate for Monday was 0.96 , and there technically still below one .
Scientists believe(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the basic reproduction rate of Covid-19 , R0 , to lie(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) somewhere between 2.4 and 3.3 .
Without measures taken(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to curb(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic , the rate of new infections would grow(#after 2020-04-28 16:49:48) exponentially , until about 70 % of the population has been infected(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
Lothar Wieler , the RKI ’s president , appealed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to the German public to “ preserve(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) our success ” of having prevented(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) health services from being overwhelmed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) , by continuing(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to apply(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) physical distancing even though federal authorities have already begun(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to relax(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) restrictions(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) on social movement .
“ Let us continue(#after 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to stay(#after 2020-04-28 16:49:48) at home as much as possible , keep(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) observing(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the restrictions(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) and keep(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) a distance of 1.5 metres from one another , ” Lothar Wieler , the RKI ’s president , said(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
Lothar Wieler , the RKI ’s president , also warned(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) of pinning(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) too many expectations(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) on a single indicator , however , saying(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) that “ R is only one index among many ” .
As German politicians are increasingly divided(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) over the speed at which social distancing measures(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) should be relaxed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) , the negative news of the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had sown(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) some confusion(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) , especially with latest official data also showing(#included Monday) new cases of confirmed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) infections with Covid-19 dropping(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) below 1,000 cases for the first time in almost seven weeks .
Other scientific institutions studying(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany question(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) whether the downward trend of recent weeks has in fact been reversed(#included recent weeks) , as the RKI ’s numbers suggest(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
In theory , the reproduction number for Monday 27 April is calculated(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) by dividing(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the number of new infections by a weighted number of infectious people .
In practice , perfectly accurate numbers on both of these counts are impossible(#overlap 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to ascertain(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) and even available data on new infections is compiled(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) with a lag of a few days .
the reproduction number for Monday 27 April is thus always an estimate(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
For the reproduction number for Monday 27 April own estimate of the reproduction number for Monday 27 April , the attempts(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to take(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) into account the time lag by ignoring(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) data from the last three days and back - dating known cases to their likely day of infection around a week earlier .
the reproduction number for Monday 27 April can therefore only give(#included Tuesday) an indication of the pandemic ’s development(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) at a point about a week and a half ago , when a relaxation(#included about a week) of social distancing(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) measures(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) had been announced(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) by Angela Merkel but not yet come(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) into effect .
Alternative models for estimating(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the reproduction number for Monday 27 April have been developed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) by the Technische Universität Ilmenau , in the eastern state of Thuringia , and the Helmholtz Centre for Infections Research in Braunschweig .
Statistician Thomas Hotz , of Ilmenau University , said(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the model used by the RKI had(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) a tendency to “ smoothen(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) out ” the number of new infections by the method in which RKI tried(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) to correct(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) for the reporting(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) delay(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) .
Statistician Thomas Hotz , of Ilmenau University said(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the model used by the RKI did not indicate(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) a sudden rise(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) of new infections , and that Statistician Thomas Hotz , of Ilmenau University believed(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) the reproduction number for Monday 27 April was likely to stay(#before 2020-04-28 16:49:48) below one in the next few days .
