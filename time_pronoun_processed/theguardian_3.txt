Why what we think(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) we know(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong .
2020-04-04 05:13:08 +00:00 .
New figures reveal(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) that what we think(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) we know(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong .
Here ’s why .
Every day we get(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) one big figure for deaths occurring in the UK .
Everyone jumps(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) on one big figure for deaths occurring in the UK , taking(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) one big figure for deaths occurring in the UK to be the latest toll .
However NHS England figures – which currently make(#included currently) up the bulk of the UK deaths(#included currently) – in fact reflect(#included currently) the day on which the death(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) was reported(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , not the actual date of death(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , which is usually days , sometimes weeks , before it appears(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) in New figures .
The truth is we do n’t know(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) how many deaths(#included the previous day) have taken(#included the previous day) place the previous day .
In fact the headline figure is likely to under(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the number of deaths that actually happened the previous day .
the number of deaths that actually happened the previous day usually mainly counts(#included currently) deaths(#included the previous day) which took(#included the previous day) place at an earlier date .
The difference matters(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) because by undercounting(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the number of deaths(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) we are skewing(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the curve .
Prof Sheila Bird , formerly of the Medical Research Council ’s biostatistics unit at Cambridge University , explains(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) : “ We ’re on a rising(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) epidemic(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) trend , and so the death counts are currently increasing(#included currently) , and We ’re trying(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) to track(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) how steeply the death counts are increasing(#included currently) .
If today Prof Sheila Bird , formerly of the Medical Research Council ’s biostatistics unit at Cambridge University ’m getting(#included currently) to know(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) about a series of deaths(#included the) that occurred(#included the previous day) in the past 10 days , then what Prof Sheila Bird , formerly of the Medical Research Council ’s biostatistics unit at Cambridge University ’m getting(#included currently) is not a reflection of the steepness of the curve at this moment . ”
On 30 March , NHS England reported(#included 30 March) 159 deaths(#included 30 March) in the 24 hours to 5 pm on Sunday 29 March .
However , the actual number of people who died(#included 30 March) in the 24 hours to 5 pm was revised(#included today) up to 401 in Thursday ’s report(#included currently) and again to 463 on Friday as more deaths(#included currently) which occurred(#included today) on that date were reported(#included currently) .
And 463 could be revised(#after 2020-04-04 05:13:08) up again as more deaths(#after 2020-04-04 05:13:08) come(#after 2020-04-04 05:13:08) to light .
“ When you ’re on a rising(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) trajectory , the reporting(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) delay is likely to mean(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) that you underestimate(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the steepness [ of the curve ] and so we may think(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) that We ’re doing better than We ’re are .
And when we come(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) to the downturn(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) in the epidemic(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , the slowing(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , and there ’s a decrease(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) in deaths(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , we ’ll be too slow to recognise(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the change .
Hence , we risk(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) getting(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the change wrong in both senses , ” Prof Sheila Bird , formerly of the Medical Research Council ’s biostatistics unit at Cambridge University adds(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) .
Another complicating(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) factor is that the Department of Health and Social Care ’s daily count covers(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) deaths(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) in hospitals , omitting(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) those in the community .
Although Department of Health and Social Care this week started(#included Sunday 29 March) releasing(#included Sunday 29 March) the number of deaths(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) including(#included Sunday 29 March) community deaths(#included Sunday 29 March) in England and Wales , there is also a time lag in this data being reported(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) .
There are other datasets we can look(#included currently) at .
The number of confirmed(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) cases of the virus is a useful indicator(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) but the virus relies(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) on testing(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , which has not been rolled(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) out to cover(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) a broad enough swathe of the general population to give(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) us a sense of how many people are possibly infected(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) .
The number of triage calls and online assessments(#included 2020-04-03) through NHS England are also useful to give(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) us a sense of potential infection levels – 1.9 m at the time of writing(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) in England .
But these are people with Covid-19 symptoms , not those with confirmed(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) cases of the virus .
The most solid data we have showing(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the trajectory of the impact(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) of the virus are deaths(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) .
That is why it is imperative that we have(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) timely and reliable data – and why the seriousness of the problem is growing(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) along with the UK's coronavirus death toll .
“ It ’s not uncommon that this happens(#included this week) in a new epidemic(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , ” Prof Sheila Bird , formerly of the Medical Research Council ’s biostatistics unit at Cambridge University says(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) .
“ Reporting delays are something to be managed(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) , not to be ashamed of .
You manage(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) Reporting delays down but you do n’t want(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) to do manage by making(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) people think(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) people will be blamed(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) for reporting(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) late and therefore run(#overlap 2020-04-04 05:13:08) the risk of failing(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) to report(#before 2020-04-04 05:13:08) .
That ’s the worst possibility . ”
