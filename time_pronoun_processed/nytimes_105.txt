Opinion(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) | I Took(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) the Antibody Test. And Yet. .
2020-04-15 21:40:46 +00:00 .
The reason to want(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) to do it is simple : I travel(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) a great deal , and I was also one of the many people who thought they might have had a milder version of coronavirus earlier in the year .
When I was sidelined(#included January) with the flu in January , I thought(#included earlier) nothing of the flu , until the flu degenerated(#included January) into one of the weirdest and most painful bouts of flu I have ever had(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) .
There were fever spikes , aches , nausea , lack of smell , a persistent dry cough(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) — all of which were later flagged(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) as key symptoms of Covid-19 .
I recovered(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) after three truly awful weeks of debilitating(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) illness .
Once the coronavirus was in full swing , I wondered(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) if I had been an early victim .
So I checked(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) , and here is what happened(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) : The test I received in the mail , which is not yet approved by the F.D.A. , was self - administered(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) , arriving(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) with a lancet to poke(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) I finger , a pipette to draw(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) the blood out and collect(#after 2020-04-15 21:40:46) the blood , a tube of solution and two plastic test strips that determine the presence of certain proteins — antibodies — in the body .
The home tests(#overlap 2020-04-15 21:40:46) are meant(#overlap 2020-04-15 21:40:46) as a start(#overlap 2020-04-15 21:40:46) , much the way other self - testing products are .
Honestly , the whole setup looked(#included earlier) like a home pregnancy test , except using(#included earlier) blood instead of urine , and was just as frictionless .
Well , except for the finger poke , which was not as easy(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) as I thought(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) .
After a long existential moment with the lancet , I drew(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) a few drops of blood , combined(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) a few drops of blood with the solution , and then added(#included earlier) a few drops to a small plastic testing device .
A line immediately appeared(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) on an indicator strip to indicate(#included earlier) that The test I received in the mail , which is not yet approved by the F.D.A. was working(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) .
I then waited(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) for eight minutes to see(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) if the other line would appear , which would show(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) I had(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) the antibodies .
No such luck .
Like a lot of people , I had hoped(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) to be able to know(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) that I very presence was not harmful to others .
This is a big deal , as our national medical star Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , recently noted(#included recently) in an interview(#included recently) on NBC : “ There may be many people out there , and I suspect(#included these) there are a fair amount , that have been infected , were asymptomatic and did n’t know it . ”
It is a national tragedy(#included these) that “ do n’t know(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) ” is pretty much how we are operating(#included these) these days .
Especially since we live(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) in a world where we are tracked(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) constantly by big corporations , where we send(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) plumes of data and cough(#before 2020-04-15 21:40:46) up information to plumes of data constantly .
And yet we can not do tracked for we own benefit when it comes(#included these) to we real lives .
