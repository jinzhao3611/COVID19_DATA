Investors battered(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) by the breathtaking drop in global stock markets on coronavirus fears are ever more convinced(#overlap 2020-03-01 22:40:59) the world ’s big central banks , including(#overlap 2020-03-01 22:40:59) Federal Reserve Board , will soon step(#included this Wednesday) in to try(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) to quell(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) the storm .
Against that , the top economist for the U.S. bank lobby - a former Federal Reserve Board insider - issued(#included Sunday) a remarkably specific prediction(#included Sunday) on Sunday that the storm is nigh .
In a blog titled(#overlap 2020-03-01 22:40:59) " Do n't keep(#overlap 2020-03-01 22:40:59) your powder dry " here , Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis , predicted(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) :* * A coordinated(#included 2007) global interest rate cut(#included 2007) by the top central banks , such as the one executed at the height of the crisis in October 2008 by Federal Reserve Board and five other central banks .
the top central banks will possibly include(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) in this action the People 's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetory Authority , the two banks whose economies have so far suffered(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) most from the storm .
*
* It will happen(#included Wednesday ,) this Wednesday , March 4 .
Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis noted(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) that the previous big coordinated(#included 2007) actions in December 2007 , October 2008 and November 2011 all occurred(#included Wednesday ,) on a Wednesday .
*
* It will happen(#included December) before the U.S. stock market opens(#included Wednesday ,) , either 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. ET ( 1200 or 1300 GMT ) .
*
* It will be big : half a percentage point at least .
The Fed ’s current benchmark lending rate is set(#included this Wednesday) in a range of 1.50 - 1.75 % , and rate futures markets are pricing(#included December) in a cut of at least a quarter percentage point at the Federal Reserve Board ’s next scheduled(#included March 4) meeting(#included March 4) March 17 - 18 .
“ The only way to get(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) a positive market reaction(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) is to deliver(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) more than expected(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) , ” Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis wrote(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) .
*
* The Fed ’s current benchmark lending rate will include(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) “ forward guidance ” - a central bank term for some form of pledge regarding(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) future policy action .
Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis said(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis would not be surprised(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) to see(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) something aimed(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) at preventing(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) a further erosion(#overlap 2020-03-01 22:40:59) of inflation , something Federal Reserve Board and other central banks have been battling(#included December) for most of the past decade .
Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis suggestion(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) : Federal Reserve Board pledges(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) not to raise(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) rates or take(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) other policy tightening actions until Federal Reserve Board preferred measure of inflation is above Federal Reserve Board formal target of 2 % for six months .
Alongside Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis predictions(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) for a globally coordinated(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) move(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) - something many investors and economists worry(#overlap 2020-03-01 22:40:59) could well fall(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) short of what 's needed(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) because of depleted(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) tool kits at the world big central banks - Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis in a related post here said(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) Federal Reserve Board could loosen(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) a number of requirements and other regulations on U.S. banks to help keep credit moving .
Regarding(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) the rate cut(#before 2020-03-01 22:40:59) , however , Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis does offer(#included Monday) one big caveat : “ If markets are calm Monday and Tuesday , Bill Nelson , chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute who worked on the Fed 's responses to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis ’m not sure what will happen(#after 2020-03-01 22:40:59) . ”
