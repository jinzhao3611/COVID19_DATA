New York's Cuomo on Saturday pushed(#included Saturday) back against what New York's Cuomo called(#included Saturday) premature demands that New York's Cuomo reopen(#included Saturday) the state , saying(#included Saturday) New York's Cuomo knew(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) people were struggling(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) without jobs but that more understanding of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) was needed(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) .
As governors in about half the United States partially reopen(#included this weekend) governors in about half the United States economies over this weekend , New York's Cuomo said(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) New York's Cuomo needed(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) much more information on what the pandemic is doing in New York's Cuomo hardest - hit state before New York's Cuomo loosens(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) restrictions(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) .
“ Even when you are in unchartered waters , it does n’t mean(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) you proceed(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) blindly , ” New York's Cuomo said(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) .
“ Use(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) information to determine(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) action - not emotions , not politics , not what people think(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) or feel(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) but what we know(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) in terms of facts . ”
Georgia and Texas are leading(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) the way in letting(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) businesses shuttered(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) by the pandemic begin(#after 2020-05-02 17:20:42) partially reopening(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) .
Leaders in those and several other states where the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) has had(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) less of an impact are under pressure to allow(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) people to return(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) to work(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) as government data released(#included this week) this weekend showed(#included this week) 30 million Americans have sought(#after March 21) unemployment benefits since March 21 .
New York's Cuomo pointed(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) to the roughly 900 new coronavirus cases hospitals in New York are still reporting(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) daily , and the fact that officials do not know(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) where those infections are coming(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) from , as reason enough to keep(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) the Empire State shutdown(#overlap 2020-05-02 17:20:42) .
New York's Cuomo also released(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) the preliminary results of a statewide antibody survey of about 15,000 people showing(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) that 12.3 % were previously infected(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) with the pandemic .
New York's Cuomo confirmed(#included about 10 days ago) the results of another test(#included about 10 days ago) with a smaller sample size released(#included about 10 days ago) about 10 days ago showing(#included about 10 days ago) that one in five New York residents has had(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) the pandemic , with the Bronx bureau seeing(#included this week) the highest number positive for antibodies at 27.6 % .
As of Saturday , the number of known infections nationwide had climbed(#included Saturday) to more than 1.1 million , including(#included Saturday) about 65,000 deaths(#included Saturday) , according to a Reuters tally .
As testing(#before 2020-05-02 17:20:42) increases(#after 2020-05-02 17:20:42) across the state , so does the number of cases .
