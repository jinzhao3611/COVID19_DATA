A former Conservative cabinet minister has said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , will want(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to avoid(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) becoming(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) a “ creature of No 10 ” amid pressure(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) on the new appointee to raise(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) government borrowing sharply .
A former Conservative cabinet minister
said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , risked(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) putting(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the public finances on an unsustainable path , given(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the headwinds facing(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the British economy .
Acknowledging(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that spending needed(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to rise(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to end(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) a decade of austerity that the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , helped(#included 2010) to instigate(#included 2010) as a Treasury minister between 2010 to 2017 , A former Conservative cabinet minister said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) : “ You have got(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) a new chancellor who will want to establish that he is not a creature of No 10 ; who is independent . ”
However , A former Conservative cabinet minister said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , might raise(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) borrowing at the budget on 11 March .
“ A former Conservative cabinet minister , A former Conservative cabinet minister would imagine(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) , would want(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to assert(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that independence .
If not necessarily on 11 March , sooner rather than later . ”
A former Conservative cabinet minister ’s comments(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) at an event hosted(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) by the Resolution Foundation thinktank in London come(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) as the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , prepares(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to reveal(#included 11 March) what is widely expected(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to be one of the most expansionary Tory budgets in a generation .
the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , replaced(#included earlier this month) Sajid Javid when New chancellor dramatically resigned(#included earlier this month) earlier this month after a confrontation(#included earlier this month) with No 10 .
Sajid Javid had been labelled(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) in Westminster circles as “ chino ” – chancellor in name only – while commentators warned(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , could become(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) known(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) as “ baby chino ” , given(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) Sajid Javid rapid rise(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to become(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) one of the youngest chancellors in history .
the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , is believed(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to be under pressure from No 10 to relax(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) public borrowing rules set(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) by Sajid Javid before the election that force day - to - day spending to be matched(#included 2010) with tax receipts by 2023 .

Gauke , who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire , said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the government ’s plans to raise(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) spending could result(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) in the UK ’s national debt rising(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) as a proportion of GDP .
Saying(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) this was a “ very strange position to find(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) ourselves in ” , particularly for a Tory government , Gauke , who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire , added(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that there were fundamental constraints(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) for the government and risks that debt could be rising(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) as the British economy falters(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) .
Gauke , who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire , warned(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that Brexit or the coronavirus outbreak could damage(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) growth(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) and the public purse .
Gauke , who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire , said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) : “ If we had(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) a downturn(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) in the British economy , are we saying(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) that debt to GDP grows(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) slowly and then grows(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) very quickly , before reverting(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to growing(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) slowly again ?
reverting strikes(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) Gauke , who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire , as an unsustainable position . ”
The former Treasury minister , who was second - in - command under Philip Hammond and served under George Osborne , said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the department with overarching control over tax and spending decisions needed(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to be “ pretty tight with public spending , and making(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) sure we do prioritise(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) ” .
The former Treasury minister , who was second - in - command under Philip Hammond and served under George Osborne , said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the alternative would be tax increases(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) , which Tory was unwilling to contemplate(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) .
In recognition(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) of the bind facing(#overlap 2020-02-24 16:26:01) New chancellor , A former Conservative cabinet minister said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) the ministry of justice had faced(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) an “ essentially unsustainable ” funding settlement during A former Conservative cabinet minister time in charge of the department with overarching control over tax and spending decisions .
Warning that the government ’s planned(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) tough approach to prison sentencing(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) would mean(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) higher prisoner numbers in future – requiring(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) more prison officers and greater funding – A former Conservative cabinet minister said(#before 2020-02-24 16:26:01) : “ Those pressures are going(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) to increase(#after 2020-02-24 16:26:01) yet further . ”
