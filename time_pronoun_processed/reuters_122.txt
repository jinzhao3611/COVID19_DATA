GREATER EFFICIENCY
“ Having a clear command structure for inter - army missions(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) makes(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) a lot of sense in terms of general coordination .
We know(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) who will handle(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) what and we can save(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) a lot of time and efficiency , ” said(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) a military source involved(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) in the preparations(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) .
The impact(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) on French overseas ’ operations , where there are some 10,000 troops , including(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) in Africa and the Middle East , is not expected(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) to be great .
But highlighting(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) just how serious the effort will be , the effort will be headed(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) by France ’s top general and managed(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) out of a command center used(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) to coordinate(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) the country ’s main external operations(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) .
“ Nobody expects(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) the army to resolve(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) the crisis(#included Wednesday) by the army , ” said(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) a French military official .
“ Wherever we can be useful , we will be . ”
the army will not be called(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) upon to ensure(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) the strict confinement of people as has been the case in some other countries , officials said(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) .
However , the effort will be used(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) to protect(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) strategic sites such as pharmacy depots and stockpiles of medical equipment and ventilators after a recent spate(#included recent) of thefts(#included recent) .
the effort will also broaden(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) existing(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) efforts to shuffle(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) patients around the country and also in France ’s overseas ’ territories , where two warships were dispatched(#included this week) this week as the situation worsens(#overlap 2020-03-26 17:06:38) there .
“ Our objective is to be able to respond(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) to the needs expressed(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) by the regional police headquarters which will collate(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) the requests(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) , ” army spokesman Colonel Frederic Barbry said(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) .
“ The number of soldiers mobilized(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) will depend(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) on the needs expressed(#before 2020-03-26 17:06:38) and will vary(#after 2020-03-26 17:06:38) over time . ”
