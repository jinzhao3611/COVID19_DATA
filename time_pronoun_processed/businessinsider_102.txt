However a new report(#included Friday) conducted(#included Friday) by a large group of Chinese scientists and published(#included Friday) in The Lancet medical journal on Friday challenges(#included Friday) this theory .
New research found(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) that the deadly Chinese coronavirus could have originated(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) elsewhere before entering(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan .
Looking(#included 2019) in detail at the cases of 41 patients infected(#included 2019) with the deadly Chinese coronavirus , scientists found(#included 2019) that the first reported(#included 1 December) case of the deadly Chinese coronavirus from 1 December had(#included 1 December) no link to a wet market in Wuhan , according to Science , which cited The Lancet report .
A new report also found(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) that 13 of the 41 cases studied had(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) no link to a wet market in Wuhan .
"

It is still not clear(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) whether the deadly Chinese coronavirus came(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) from a wet market in Wuhan or not , but New research says(#included now) there is a possibility that the deadly Chinese coronavirus did not .
One way to establish(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) for certainty whether the deadly Chinese coronavirus originated(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) from a wet market in Wuhan would be to take(#before 2020-01-27 15:58:22) samples from the animals in a wet market in Wuhan â€” but a wet market in Wuhan has now been cleared(#included now) and disinfected(#included now) , according to The Conversation .
