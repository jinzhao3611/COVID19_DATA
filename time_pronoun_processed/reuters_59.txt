OTTAWA / TORONTO , March 31 ( Reuters ) -
Extending(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz ’s tenure past the June expiration of his term would help(#after 2020-03-31 21:23:56) underpin(#after 2020-03-31 21:23:56) market confidence as the coronavirus pandemic hits(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) the economy , a government official and market players said(#included 2020-03-31) on Tuesday .
A new governor is slated(#included 2019-06-03) to take(#included 2019-06-03) the reins on June 3 when Poloz , 64 , ends(#included 2019-06-03) Poloz , 64 , seven - year tenure , but Ottawa has so far not named(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) a successor .
The recruitment(#included 2019-06-03) process began(#included 2019) last year and was expected(#included 2019-06-03) to have been completed(#included 2019-06-03) by this spring , the bank ’s board said(#included 2019-12) in December .
The prime minister and finance minister , who have(#included 2020-03-31) the final say , have been busy rolling(#included 2019-06-03) out economic aid packages amid the coronavirus pandemic .
A new governor has been through the wildest month of his term in the face of the coronavirus pandemic .
Bank of Canada cut(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) key interest rates three times by a total of 1.5 percentage points to 0.25 % and embarked(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) on large - scale asset purchases(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) , or quantitative easing , for the first time .
A senior government source told(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Reuters that A senior government source could “ completely understand(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) why ... ( people ) would want(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) to see(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) A new governor stay(#after 2020-03-31 21:23:56) longer during a period like this . ”
A senior government source said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) such a move(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) would support(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) confidence but that A senior government source was unaware of discussions(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) about an extension .
If Poloz , 64 , stayed(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) on about six months or “ until the recovery is well under way , ” the recovery would bolster(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) confidence , said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Michael Goshko , corporate risk manager at Western Union Business Solutions .
﻿Karl Schamotta , chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments , said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) “ perception issues ... tend(#overlap 2020-03-31 21:23:56) to dog(#overlap 2020-03-31 21:23:56) new central bankers ” and Poloz , 64 , remaining(#overlap 2020-03-31 21:23:56) on would help(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) avert(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) tend .
A Bank of Canada spokeswoman said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) the process for appointing(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) a new governor was proceeding(#overlap 2020-03-31 21:23:56) as planned(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) and that extending(#after 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Poloz ’s term “ would be a decision(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) for the government . ”
The finance minister ’s office had(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) no immediate comment(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) .
In December , Poloz , 64 , said(#included 2019-12) Poloz , 64 , would step(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) down when Poloz , 64 , mandate expired(#included 2019-12) .
Asked(#included 2020-04) this month whether Poloz , 64 , would reconsider(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) , Poloz , 64 , replied(#included 2020-04) : “ Poloz , 64 , have(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) no plans to change(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) step . ”
Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney , who was Poloz ’s predecessor , extended(#included 2020-03) Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney , who was Poloz ’s predecessor tenure more than two years to March 2020 from March 2020 planned(#included 2018) 2018 end as the UK completed(#included 2018) the UK exit(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) from the European Union .
Capital Economics senior Canada economist Stephen Brown said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) that while extending(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Poloz ’s term could help(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) , Capital Economics senior Canada economist Stephen Brown could also remain(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) in “ some form of temporary adviser role ” to the next governor .
On March 31 , after a rate cut(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) and as coronavirus cases started(#included 2020-03-13) to balloon(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) in Canada , Poloz , 64 , , in a rare departure(#included 2019-12) , lauded(#included 2020-03-13) Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins in a news conference(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) for Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins extensive experience during the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis(#included 2008) .
Both Schamotta and Capital Economics senior Canada economist Stephen Brown said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins would be a good choice if Poloz , 64 , does not want(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) to remain(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) .
“ Markets have(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) a lot of confidence in Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins ability to steer(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) Bank of Canada , ” Schamotta said(#before 2020-03-31 21:23:56) .
