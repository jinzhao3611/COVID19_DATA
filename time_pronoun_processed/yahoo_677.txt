Parents are being left(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) in limbo over how to feed(#overlap 2020-04-25 14:54:10) Parents children because the government 's free meals voucher scheme has been a " disaster " , senior teachers have claimed(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) .
The Department for Education ( DfE ) is currently providing(#included currently) vouchers during the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) - worth £ 15 per child per week - for youngsters who would normally be eligible for free meals .
The Department for Education ( DfE ) initially promised(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) schools that parents would receive(#after 2020-04-25 14:54:10) codes to obtain(#after 2020-04-25 14:54:10) vouchers online on the same day as schools applied(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) for vouchers , according to documents seen(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) by Sky News .
But teaching staff were told(#included 2020-W13) last week by The Department for Education ( DfE ) that orders(#included 2020-W13) had to be placed(#included 2020-W13) " four calendar days before the due date " .
One senior teacher told(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) Sky News One senior teacher had spent(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) the last two days fielding(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) questions from parents who could not redeem(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) vouchers or had not received(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) codes .
Claire Lotriet , an acting co - headteacher from south London , said(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) the scheme - which is run by the DfE and a company called Edenred - had been a " nightmare " .
" When Claire Lotriet , an acting co - headteacher from south London , try(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) to resend(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) codes , Claire Lotriet , an acting co - headteacher from south London , get(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) constant errors , " Claire Lotriet , an acting co - headteacher from south London , said(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) .

Claire Lotriet , an acting co - headteacher from south London , feel(#overlap 2020-04-25 14:54:10) helpless .
" The Edenred system can not cope(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) and it is immensely stressful knowing(#overlap 2020-04-25 14:54:10) families who need(#overlap 2020-04-25 14:54:10) these vouchers are not getting(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) these vouchers and yet there 's relatively little Claire Lotriet , an acting co - headteacher from south London , can do to resolve(#before 2020-04-25 14:54:10) these vouchers .
