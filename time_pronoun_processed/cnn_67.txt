Although physicians still have(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) no vaccine or cure for the novel coronavirus , health officials and pharmaceutical companies around the world are working(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) hard to develop(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) potential coronavirus vaccines and treatments .
the novel coronavirus is spreading(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) globally and has killed(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) at least 2,800 people , the vast majority in mainland China .
There have been more than 83,000 global cases , with infections on every continent , except Antarctica .
What to know(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) about the novel coronavirus
More than 20 potential vaccines aimed at preventing coronavirus disease are in development(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) around the world , the World Health Organization 's director - general said(#included Friday) Friday .
But health officials have consistently said(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) it will take(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) at least a year before any vaccine is proven effective and gets(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) necessary approvals for wide distribution(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) .
Meanwhile , several treatments aimed(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) at healing patients or alleviating(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) symptoms already are in clinical trials(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) .
Here are some recent developments(#included recent) in the race for treatments(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) and vaccines for the novel coronavirus An existing(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) antiviral drug , remdesivir , is showing(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) signs of helping(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) to treat(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) the novel coronavirus , the World Health Organization 's has said(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) .
Participants will receive(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when Participants 're enrolled(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) and another 100 while Participants 're hospitalized(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) for up to 10 days in total .
A placebo group will receive(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients , the World Health Organization 's said(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) .
" the World Health Organization 's will know(#included soon) reasonably soon whether a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients works(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) .
And if a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients does , the World Health Organization 's will then have(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) an effective therapy to distribute(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) , " Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said(#included Wednesday) Wednesday .
One will be for about 400 patients with severe symptoms .
The other will be for about 600 patients with more moderate symptoms .
The study will look(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) at the effectiveness of different dosing durations : Patients in both groups will receive(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) the drug for either five or 10 days .
Results of The study have n't been widely reported(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) , but there are a few reasons to explore(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) HIV antiretroviral drugs .
Like HIV , coronaviruses are RNA viruses .
And years ago , a combination of HIV drugs and an antiviral drug seemed(#included 2002) to help(#included 2002) some patients in the 2002 - 2004 outbreak(#included 2002) of SARS , caused(#included 2002) by a different coronavirus , according to a study published(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) in the journal Thorax A number of companies around the world say(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) A number of companies around the world 've developed(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) potential vaccines after obtaining genetic information about HIV .
But the reality is that health officials insist(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) More than 20 potential vaccines aimed at preventing coronavirus disease ca n't be approved(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) for at least a year .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , gave(#included Wednesday) CNN this outlook on Wednesday : -- The first Phase 1 clinical trial(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) could begin(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) in about two months .
--
Such a trial(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) , involving(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) about 45 people , would last(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) about three months .
Researchers would try(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) to determine(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) if the candidate is safe and immunogenic .
--
The next phase , involving(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) hundreds of people , would last(#after 2020-02-28 22:18:34) another six to eight months .
So , even if a candidate is proven(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) safe and effective , a candidate wo n't be ready for use this year , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said(#included Wednesday) .
Now , a look at some candidates : Moderna , using(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) messenger RNA , aims(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) to make(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) drugs that direct(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) cells in the body to make(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) proteins to prevent(#overlap 2020-02-28 22:18:34) or fight(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) disease .
The technology has had(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) positive results from Phase 1 tests(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) across six different vaccines , one of which is currently in a Phase 2 trial(#included currently) , according to a company spokesperson .
But Moderna has yet to produce(#before 2020-02-28 22:18:34) a proven vaccine with Moderna mRNA platform .
