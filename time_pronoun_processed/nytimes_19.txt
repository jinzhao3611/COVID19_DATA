How to campaign(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) during the coronavirus outbreak As President Trump has appeared(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) before the nation for daily briefings(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) and labeled(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) President Trump a “ wartime president , ” former Vice President Joseph R.

And the unusual situation has left(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — the candidate who seems all but certain to face Mr. Trump in the general election — trying(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) to figure(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) out how to position(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) former Vice President Joseph R.

Adding(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) the coronavirus pandemic to the equation has made(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) the stakes even higher and made(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) the difference between Democratic and Republican visions of what the system should look(#after 2020-03-28 09:03:09) like even more stark .
Advancing(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) “ Medicare for all ” has , for two cycles now , been Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont ’s central policy priority , and our colleague Sydney Ember reports(#overlap 2020-03-28 09:03:09) that our colleague Sydney Ember “ believes(#included This) our colleague Sydney Ember can meld(#included This) this moment of national crisis(#included Sunday) with the progressive policy agenda that has been our colleague Sydney Ember life ’s work . ”

How about another Super Tuesday ?
Thanks to multiple postponements(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) connected(#before 2020-03-28 09:03:09) to public health concerns , as many as 10 states and the District of Columbia may now hold(#included April) primaries on June 2 , making(#included April) it suddenly quite important to the Democratic primary race .
As of this writing , June 2 would confer(#included June 2) a trove of delegates so large primaries would be second only to Super Tuesday in early March .
And as such , the June Tuesday that was once an afterthought could now represent(#included June 2) former Vice President Joseph R.
