NASA and SpaceX prepare(#overlap 2020-04-17 16:28:45) to launch(#after 2020-04-17 16:28:45) astronauts from the United States again NASA has shut(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) down many of NASA activities in response(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) to coronavirus , but NASA has maintained(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) all ISS - related activity .
NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan returned(#included Friday) from NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan stay(#included Friday) on the International Space Station aboard a Russian spacecraft on Friday .
the International Space Station has continually hosted(#after 2000) a rotating(#after 2000) crew of astronauts from all over the world since 2000 .
NASA and SpaceX are the International Space Station primary operators , but since 2011 , Russia has been the only country capable of transporting(#after 2000) astronauts to and from the International Space Station .
NASA has paid(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) up to $ 86 million per seat and about $ 55.4 million on average to fly(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) US astronauts aboard Russia Soyuz spacecraft , according to NASA inspector general .

But development(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) of both spacecraft took(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) years longer than expected(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) .
Here 's how NASA protects(#overlap 2020-04-17 16:28:45) astronauts and the International Space Station from coronavirus

Less than a month earlier , Boeing Starliner spacecraft suffered(#included Years ago) major setbacks during an uncrewed orbital flight(#included Years ago) test(#included Years ago) .
SpaceX Crew Dragon has since said(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) SpaceX Crew Dragon will repeat(#included 2017) historic NASA astronaut mission in the fall .

astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are both former military test pilots and veteran astronauts who previously flew(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) on space shuttle missions(#before 2020-04-17 16:28:45) .
