Toby Melville LONDON ( Reuters ) - Royal Dutch Shell has postponed(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) decisions(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) on whether to go(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) ahead with two large oil and gas developments(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea after oil prices collapsed(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) due to the coronavirus crisis , a company source said(#included Wednesday) on Wednesday .
Toby Melville LONDON ( Reuters ) - Royal Dutch Shell slashed(#included 2020) Toby Melville LONDON ( Reuters ) - Royal Dutch Shell 2020 spending plans by a fifth as measures(#included January 29 , 2015) to halt(#after 2020-04-22 18:54:59) the spread of the coronavirus crisis led(#included 2020) to an unprecedented drop in oil demand and sent(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) oil prices to oil prices lowest in two decades .
As a result of this , a company source said(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) Shell had delayed(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) a final investment(#included 2017) decision(#included recent years) ( FID ) to 2021 on whether to develop(#after 2020-04-22 18:54:59) its Whale discovery in the southern part of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico .
a company source said(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) some work(#overlap 2020-04-22 18:54:59) on its Whale discovery in the southern part of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continued(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) .
A decision(#included later this year) on Whale was initially planned(#included later this year) for later this year , following(#included 2017) the discovery(#included 2017) in 2017 of what Shell said(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) was one of Shell biggest finds(#included recent years) here in recent years .
Shell holds(#overlap 2020-04-22 18:54:59) 60 % in the field , while Shell holds(#overlap 2020-04-22 18:54:59) the remaining 40 % .
its Whale discovery in the southern part of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ’s pace has slowed(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) and an investment(#included next year) decision(#included next year) has been put(#included 2020) off to next year , a Shell spokeswoman said(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) .
Shell last month cut(#included January 29 , 2015) Shell 2020 project budget by $ 4 billion and suspended(#included January 29 , 2015) share buybacks(#included January 29 , 2015) to save(#included January 29 , 2015) cash .
Shell also decided(#included later this year) this month to defer(#included later this year) a decision(#included later this year) about the Jackdaw natural gas field in Britain ’s North Sea , a company source said(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) .
The development plan originally envisaged(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) linking(#included 2020) the Jackdaw natural gas field in Britain to the existing(#overlap 2020-04-22 18:54:59) Shearwater platform by 2024 .
The delays(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) come(#overlap 2020-04-22 18:54:59) after private - equity backed Siccar Point , Shell ’s partner in another North Sea project , Cambo , announced(#included last month) on March 20 that the FID on the Jackdaw natural gas field in Britain was pushed(#included 2017) back to 2021 due to coronavirus .
Shell previously said(#before 2020-04-22 18:54:59) projects Shell would develop(#after 2020-04-22 18:54:59) would be built(#after 2020-04-22 18:54:59) to generate(#after 2020-04-22 18:54:59) profit with Brent crude at $ 30 a barrel or more .
The benchmark was around $ 20 on Wednesday .
