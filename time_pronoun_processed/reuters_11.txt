( Reuters ) - Texas would agree(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) to oil production(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) curbs if U.S. President Donald Trump reached(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) an agreement with international producers on cutbacks , a state energy regulator said(#included 2020-04-03) on Friday in remarks(#included 2020-04-03) that drew(#included 2020-04-03) push(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) back from fellow commissioners .

Nick Oxford / File Photo Ryan Sitton , one of three members of the Texas Railroad Commission , which regulates oil and gas production in the state , said(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) in an interview(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) on CNBC that any production cuts(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) would be temporary .
There is no need for a long - term deal , Nick Oxford / File Photo Ryan Sitton , one of three members of the Texas Railroad Commission , which regulates oil and gas production in the state , said(#included 2020-04-03) .
However , the state ’s other commissioners , Christi Craddick and Wayne Christian , took(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) to Twitter to say(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) that the state ’s other commissioners , Christi Craddick and Wayne Christian had not yet made(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) up the state ’s other commissioners , Christi Craddick and Wayne Christian minds on the matter and would wait(#before 2020-04-14) until an April 14 hearing to decide(#after 2020-04-04 01:23:10) on any cuts(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) .
“ One commissioner does not speak(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) ” for the Texas Railroad Commission , which regulates oil and gas production in the state , Christi Craddick tweeted(#included 2020-04-03) , adding(#included 2020-04-03) that “ Texas operators will be heard(#after 2020-04-04 01:23:10) . ”
Wayne Christian seconded(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) Wayne Christian opinion , tweeting(#included 2020-04-03) , “ If a release or tweet comes(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) from an individual commish , a release or tweet does not signal(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) consensus from the agency . ”
Any agreement(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) to curb(#after 2020-04-04 01:23:10) output would require(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) support from two of the three commissioners .
Oil prices plunged(#included 2020-03) to 18 - year lows last month as the coronavirus pandemic(#included 2020-03) crushed(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) demand and Saudi Arabia and Russia began(#included 2020-03) a price war(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) .
U.S. President Donald Trump met(#included 2020-04-03) with U.S. oil executives on Friday after saying(#included 2020-04-03) U.S. President Donald Trump had brokered(#included 2020-04-03) a deal with the Saudis and Russians to reduce their production .
Benchmark U.S. crude futures were up 12 % to settle(#included 2020-04-03) at 28.34 a barrel on Friday on hopes(#included 2020-04-03) supply cuts(#included 2020-04-03) would be agreed(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) upon at an emergency meeting on Monday of OPEC and allies .
In parts of Texas , oil has been trading(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) for under $ 10 a barrel .
“ If U.S. cutting would help(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) get(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) a deal with the Saudis and Russians to reduce their production done , then yes , I think(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) Texas would be supportive of trading , ” I said(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) on CNBC .
Some proposals , such as limiting natural gas flaring , would not work(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) because Some proposals , such as limiting natural gas flaring , could disproportionately hurt(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) some operators , I said(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) .
Regulators in Oklahoma this week also were urged(#included 2020-W14) by oil and gas producers to consider(#included 2020-03) mandated(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) production cuts .
Unlike in Texas , where large shale producers Parsley Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources are leading(#overlap 2020-04-04 01:23:10) the call for cutbacks(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) , a group of smaller oil companies asked(#included 2020-W14) the Texas Railroad Commission , which regulates oil and gas production in the state this week to consider(#included 2020-W14) cuts(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) .
In Oklahoma , any output curbs would require(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) a court to rule(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) on the issue before the issue could be brought(#before 2020-04-04 01:23:10) to the three commissioners .
