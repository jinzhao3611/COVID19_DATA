Even though a Future of Gaming event at which it will preview " the games you 'll be playing after PlayStation 5 launches " towards the end of 2020 would n't have taken(#included June 4) place at June 's traditional video games industry event , the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) -- PlayStation had withdrawn(#before 2020-05-29 17:17:52) long before COVID-19 forced(#before 2020-05-29 17:17:52) June 's traditional video games industry event , the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) -- PlayStation cancellation(#before 2020-05-29 17:17:52) -- SIE President and CEO Jim Ryan noted(#before 2020-05-29 17:17:52) that " for the first time , we will all be virtually experiencing the excitement together " via PlayStation 5 games showcase .
