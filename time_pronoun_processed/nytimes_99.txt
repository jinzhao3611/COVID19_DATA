LONDON — When Queen Elizabeth II turns(#included Tuesday) 94 on Tuesday , for the first time in Queen Elizabeth II nearly seven - decade reign(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) her birthday will not be marked(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) by a gun salute — another longstanding ritual lost(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) to the grim siege(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) of the coronavirus .
Queen Elizabeth II requested(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) that “ no special measures be put(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) in place ” for artillery guns to be fired(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) from multiple sites around London , according to Buckingham Palace , because Queen Elizabeth II did not “ feel(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) it appropriate in the current circumstances . ”
Queen Elizabeth II also instructed(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) that flags should not be flown(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) in Queen Elizabeth II honor unless flown could be done while observing(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) social distancing(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) restrictions(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) .
Buckingham Palace said(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) Queen Elizabeth II , did not plan(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) to mark(#included Tuesday) her birthday “ in any special way . ”
Queen Elizabeth II might speak(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) to members of the royal family , who are scattered(#overlap 2020-04-18 12:31:18) across the country , by video call(#included June) , a palace official said(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) , but the conversations would be private .
Buckingham Palace had already scrapped(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) the queen ’s birthday parade , known as Trooping the Color .
the queen ’s birthday parade , known as Trooping the Color is traditionally held(#included June) in June and draws(#included June) thousands of spectators to the wide avenue in front of Buckingham Palace , as fighter jets roar(#included Tuesday) overhead .
Queen Elizabeth II has managed(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) to be at once conspicuously absent(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) and reassuringly visible(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) during the pandemic .
Queen Elizabeth II left(#included March 19) London abruptly on March 19 , four days before Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed(#included March 19) a lockdown(#included April 5) on the country , and has been living(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) in isolation at Windsor Castle since then .
But Queen Elizabeth II delivered(#included April 5) a rare televised address on April 5 to rally(#included April 5) Britons for the national struggle(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) against the pandemic .
Drawing(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) on Queen Elizabeth II own experience as a young princess during World War II , Queen Elizabeth II appealed(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) to the country to show(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) solidarity and stoicism — not by drawing(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) together but by staying(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) apart .
“ We should take(#included June) comfort that while we may have(#after 2020-04-18 12:31:18) more still to endure(#after 2020-04-18 12:31:18) , better days will return(#after 2020-04-18 12:31:18) , ” Queen Elizabeth II said(#included Tuesday) .
“ We will be with We friends again ; We will be with We families again ; We will meet(#included June) again . ”
That last line alluded(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) to “ We ’ll Meet(#after 2020-04-18 12:31:18) Again , ” a 1939 song popularized(#included 1939) by Vera Lynn that became(#included 1939) a wartime favorite in Britain .
a rare televised address carried(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) a distinct echo of the famous speech(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) Queen Elizabeth II ’s father , George VI , gave(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) on the brink of the war(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) , lending(#included Tuesday) a rare televised address emotional resonance in the country .
Less than an hour after Queen Elizabeth II spoke(#included earlier this month) earlier this month , the country announced(#included earlier this month) that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been hospitalized(#included earlier this month) with the pandemic .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) three nights in intensive care and is now recuperating(#included June) at Chequers , the country residence of British prime ministers .
Several of Mr. Johnson ’s senior aides were also infected(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) .
Fears(#included Tuesday) for the queen ’s health surged(#included Tuesday) after Prince Charles , her eldest son and heir to the throne , announced(#included April 5) on March 25 that Prince Charles , her eldest son and heir to the throne was suffering(#included April 5) symptoms of the pandemic .
Prince Charles , her eldest son and heir to the throne , had met(#included April 5) Prince Charles , her eldest son and heir to the throne mother on March 12 , only a day before Prince Charles , her eldest son and heir to the throne medical advisers assessed(#included April 5) that Prince Charles , her eldest son and heir to the throne could have been infectious .
News outlets reported(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) that one of the queen ’s footmen , who is responsible for walking(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) her dogs , had also contracted(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) the pandemic .
Buckingham Palace took(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) extraordinary measures to protect(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) her during the taping(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) of a rare televised address , allowing(#included Tuesday) only a single camera operator , wearing(#included Tuesday) a mask and gloves , to be in the room .
Queen Elizabeth II looked(#included Tuesday) at ease and alert during a rare televised address , and Buckingham Palace has offered(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) no updates(#before 2020-04-18 12:31:18) on Queen Elizabeth II condition .
