Pelosi aims(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to move(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) fast on next rescue(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) package .
2020-03-31 00:40:32 +00:00 .
“ It is clear that we need(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to do more , and that is particularly true when it comes(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to protecting(#included earlier Monday) the health and safety of frontline health workers , ” House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott ( D - Va. ) told(#included earlier Monday) reporters earlier Monday .
The bill could see(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) a vote(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) on the floor within weeks .
The House is scheduled(#included Easter) to be out until April 20 , and lawmakers are eager(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to avoid(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) a return(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to the Capitol until absolutely necessary amid the fast - spreading coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Pelosi said(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) The House would likely vote(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) on The bill after The House return(#included late April) from the Easter and Passover holidays in late April , though there ’s always the possibility lawmakers return(#included Easter) sooner if Congress is needed(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to act(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Alternatively , if lawmakers are far from a deal , lawmakers may stay(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) away for longer .
“ I do think(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) that it is really important that as soon as we are here , we are ready to pass(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) legislation , ” Pelosi said(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Three days after Trump signed(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) The bill , it ’s not immediately clear(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) how much more help might be needed(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
But top Democrats have been vocal about pushing(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) for another rescue measure — with even bigger cash payments(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to Americans — as the virus continues(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to ravage(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) the U.S. economy and more are infected(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Initial jobless claims have soared(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) past 3 million and public health officials are predicting(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Many Democrats are also eager(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to make(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) another fight(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) for policies — like robust family and medical leave programs(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) and stronger worker protections for first responders — that were turned(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) down by GOP negotiators in previous bills .
Democrats have also said(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) the federal government will likely need(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to send(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) more cash to state and local governments , as well as cover(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) the costs associated(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) with coronavirus treatments and food assistance .
Even as he battles(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) with some governors , Trump has also acknowledged(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) the need to deliver(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) more emergency funds to states .
“ States are bleeding(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) out , ” Rep. Josh Gottheimer ( D - N.J. ) , whose district has 1,800 cases , said(#included Monday) in an interview(#included Monday) Monday .
“ There ’s no revenue coming(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) in , then you add(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to that , the massive costs of care and treatment .
That ’s just a huge hole to dig(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) out of .
We ’re going(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to need(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) more resources . ”
Then , Rep. Josh Gottheimer ( D - N.J. ) , whose district has 1,800 cases added(#included Monday) , there are big questions about how to stimulate(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) the U.S. economy in the weeks and months ahead when normal life begins(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to resume(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) : “ Are people going(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to rush(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) back to a restaurant ?
Are people going(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to rush(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) back to an amusement park ?
There are going(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to be certain things that take(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) longer to come(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) back . ” Republicans , meanwhile , have said(#included Monday) it ’s too early to consider(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) what might be included(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) in a potential “ Phase 4 ” package , noting(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) that a potential “ Phase 4 ” package is in the process of being implemented(#included current) .
“ Let ’s let(#included current) this work(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Let ’s let(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) this work(#after 2020-03-31 00:40:32) inside America , ” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) said(#included earlier Monday) last week .
Senate Republicans in particular are not eager(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to rush(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) into another large stimulus package , particularly with a focus on infrastructure and other spending not directly related to the health crisis(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
And Senate Republicans were quick to dismiss(#included earlier Monday) The bill as nothing more than an ideological wish list .
“ It just seems(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to be a fundamental difference in how we ’re approaching(#included current) this and how The House is approaching(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) this , ” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) said(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) .
Senate Republicans are also wary(#overlap 2020-03-31 00:40:32) of getting(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) forced(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) to pass(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) another The House spending package that Senate Republicans had(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) little input on .
While Senate passed(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) a potential “ Phase 4 ” package overwhelmingly , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) had to urge(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) caucus to “ gag and go(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) for a potential “ Phase 4 ” package ” because of concerns over House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) paid(#before 2020-03-31 00:40:32) sick leave provisions .
