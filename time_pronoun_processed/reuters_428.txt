The diverse opponents of qualified immunity have thrown(#included PRESENT_REF) The diverse opponents of qualified immunity weight behind at least five appeals now awaiting(#included PRESENT_REF) the Supreme Court ’s attention , each considered(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) a potential means of removing(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) or softening(#after 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the doctrine .
One of The diverse opponents of qualified immunity is the case of Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in .
By Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in ’s account , Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in had already put(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) up his hands in surrender(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) when police released(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) a service dog that then rushed Baxter and bit him , resulting in an injury that required hospital treatment .
police said(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) police did not see(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) his hands raised(#included March 30 , 2020) before police released(#included March 30 , 2020) a service dog that then rushed Baxter and bit him , resulting in an injury that required hospital treatment .
While serving(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the 12 - year prison sentence arising(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) from Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in conviction(#included March 30 , 2020) for attempted(#included March 30 , 2020) theft(#included March 30 , 2020) on the night of the alleged attack(#included March 30 , 2020) , Baxter – originally representing himself – sued(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the cops in federal court , alleging(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) that the cops used(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) excessive force by setting(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) a service dog that then rushed Baxter and bit him , resulting in an injury that required hospital treatment on Baxter – originally representing himself – .
A federal district court judge hearing Baxter ’s case allowed(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) Baxter ’s case to move(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) forward .
But in a Nov. 8 , 2018 , ruling , the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati , Ohio , granted(#included Nov. 8 , 2018) police immunity .
Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in then petitioned(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the Supreme Court to overturn(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) federal court .
“ I felt(#included March 30 , 2020) like police were wrongly getting(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) away with spilling(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) I blood , ” Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in told(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) Reuters in a handwritten letter sent(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) from prison in Tennessee .
Now , the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute are providing(#included Now) legal support for Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in .
The Alliance Defending Freedom , a conservative Christian advocacy group , the NAACP Legal Defense Educational Fund , a civil rights group , and a diverse collection of legal scholars are also backing(#overlap 2020-05-08 10:37:20) some of the cases awaiting(#overlap 2020-05-08 10:37:20) federal court ’s attention .
In the Alexander Baxter , a homeless man arrested in Nashville , Tennessee , during a Jan. 8 , 2014 , home break - in petition(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) , one of 11 qualified immunity appeals the Supreme Court plans(#included May 15) to discuss(#included May 15) on May 15 , the liberal American Civil Liberties Union has explicitly asked(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute to consider(#overlap 2020-05-08 10:37:20) whether qualified immunity should be “ narrowed(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) or abolished(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) . ”
the libertarian Cato Institute , meanwhile , has filed(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) friend - of - the - court briefs for Baxter ’s case and others like friend - of - the - court briefs for Baxter ’s case as part of a campaign(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) to end(#included Nov. 8 , 2018) qualified(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) immunity .
If the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute were to take(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) up Baxter ’s case or another like it , the liberal American Civil Liberties Union , the libertarian Cato Institute and other foes of qualified(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) immunity are ready with arguments that the doctrine is improperly and inconsistently applied(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) ; that the doctrine has(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) no basis in civil rights law ; and that the doctrine purported(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) benefits – to avoid second - guessing officers or saddling second - guessing officers with distracting lawsuits – do not justify trampling civil rights .
The critics do not universally agree(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) on what could replace(#after 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the doctrine , or , if the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute refuse(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) to abolish(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) the doctrine , how the doctrine can be improved(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) .
Some suggest(#overlap 2020-05-08 10:37:20) removing(#after 2020-05-08 10:37:20) protections for officers that have been built(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) up over years to avoid(#overlap 2020-05-08 10:37:20) disclosing(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) evidence , for instance , or assessing(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) whether the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute acted(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) in good faith .
Others call(#overlap 2020-05-08 10:37:20) for a rethink(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) of the two - question test for deciding(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) requests(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) for qualified immunity .
“ I do n’t know(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) we know(#included Now) the right answer yet , ” said(#before 2020-05-08 10:37:20) I .
