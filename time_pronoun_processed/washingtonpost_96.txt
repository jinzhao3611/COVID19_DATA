There was nothing that pleased(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) Miller more , said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) his wife Donna Miller , than seeing(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) the people around Miller having(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) a good time .
Last week , however , Miller was alone when Miller was taken(#included Last week) to Southern Maryland Hospital Center in Prince George ’s County .

And on April 15 , Miller was alone when Miller died(#included April 15) , becoming(#included April 15) the first Montgomery County government employee to lose(#included April 15) to Miller life to the disease .

“ We said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) that We loved(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) Miller , that We were praying(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) for Miller , and it was okay to move(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) on , ” his mother Jessye Miller , 93 said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
“ That ’s the one thing that has helped(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) We through this .
That We were able to say(#included Last week) goodbye . ”
Born(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) in Shartlesville , Pa. , Miller was a kind but “ rambunctious ” boy , his mother Jessye Miller , 93 said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) , chuckling(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
Miller split(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) Miller childhood between Maryland and Pennsylvania .
Miller later joined(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) the Army and was stationed(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) in Germany .
In the 1990s , Miller met(#included the 1990s) his wife Donna Miller and settled(#included the 1990s) down with his wife Donna Miller in Prince George ’s County , where they raised(#included 2011) two sons , Joshua and Jonathan , and welcomed(#included 2011) three grandchildren .
In 2011 , Miller joined(#included 2011) the Montgomery County Department of Transportation as a motor pool attendant , which involved(#included 2011) checking(#included 2011) and maintaining(#included 2011) the buses as the buses came(#included 2011) into the depot .
Miller always “ had(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) a joke and a giggle ” while Miller was working(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) , said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) Silver Spring depot chief Andre Lucas , and Silver Spring depot chief Andre Lucas did n’t gripe when the hours were long .
Every year , to prepare(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) for the department ’s “ Give and Ride Week , ” where passengers donate(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) nonperishable food items in exchange for riding(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) for free , Miller would come(#included the week) to the depot the weekend before to personally outfit(#included the weekend) 140 buses with bags for donations(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
Miller made(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) it Miller mission to check(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) the bags throughout the week and diligently(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) collected(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) the donations(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) for area food banks .
“ It was Miller nature , ” Silver Spring depot chief Andre Lucas said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) , “ to go(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) out of Miller way . ”
Outside work , Miller was heavily involved(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) in the fraternal organizations , Prince Hall Masonry and the Shriners , through which Miller volunteered(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) at soup kitchens and helped(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) to host(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) charitable events .
And when Miller needed(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) to rest(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) , Miller would head(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) for the woods — with his wife Donna Miller .
“ That was our time , ” his wife Donna Miller said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) of their camping(#included 2011) trips(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
“ To rest(#included the week) , relax(#included the week) , get(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) away from everything . ”
In late March , Miller started(#included late March) experiencing(#included late March) symptoms consistent with covid-19 and stopped(#included late March) going(#included late March) to work(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
Miller was tested(#included the weekend) on March 31 and received(#included a week later) Miller test(#included a week later) results(#included a week later) a week later , but by that time , Miller condition had significantly deteriorated(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
Miller was coughing(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) continuously and had(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) trouble breathing , his mother Jessye Miller , 93 recalled(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .
“ In 30 years , his mother Jessye Miller , 93 had never seen(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) Miller that sick(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) or that scared , ” his mother Jessye Miller , 93 said(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) .

On April 7 , Miller was admitted(#included April 7) to a critical care unit , where Miller died(#included April 7) eight days later .
Friends and family say(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) Friends and family were taken(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) aback by how rapidly Miller deteriorated(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) and are unsure where Miller might have contracted(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) the disease — Miller had(#included recent) no recent travel history or known contact(#overlap 2020-04-18 21:58:38) with anyone who had tested(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) positive for the disease .
For now , his wife Donna Miller said(#included now) , his wife Donna Miller is trying(#overlap 2020-04-18 21:58:38) to focus(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) on what mattered to her husband and assume(#after 2020-04-18 21:58:38) her husband role as protective dad to Friends and family two sons and three granddaughters .
But in the longer term , his wife Donna Miller is n’t sure(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) how to fill(#overlap 2020-04-18 21:58:38) the space Miller held(#before 2020-04-18 21:58:38) in my entire life .
“ Frankly , my ’m — my ’m a little lost(#included now) right now .
