San Francisco orders(#overlap 2020-03-16 19:33:43) residents(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) to shelter in place .

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced(#included Monday) on Monday that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is recommending(#included Tuesday) moving(#after 2020-03-16 19:33:43) the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus .
“ It is clear that tomorrow ’s in person voting(#included tomorrow) does not conform , and can not conform(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) with these CDC guidelines .
We can not conduct(#included Tuesday) the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus tomorrow , the in person voting(#included tomorrow) for 13 hours tomorrow and conform to these CDC guidelines , ” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said(#included Monday) .
“ We should not be in a situation where the votes(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) of these individuals , who are conflicted(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) , are suppressed(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) .
It is therefore my recommendation(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) after talking(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine , talking(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) with the attorney general , talking(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) with the lieutenant governor , that voting(#included June 2nd) be extended(#before June 2nd) until June 2nd .
That no in person voting(#included Tuesday) occur(#included today) June 2nd , but rather that in person voting occur(#included June 2nd) on June 2nd , but between now and then that absentee ballot voting(#included Tuesday) be permitted(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) . ”
Important to note(#overlap 2020-03-16 19:33:43) : Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine , however , said(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine does not have(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) the power to move(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus unilaterally and will now go(#included tomorrow) to court to move(#after 2020-03-16 19:33:43) the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus .
moving is a complicated one for Ohio officials , as voters have already started(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) voting(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) in Ohio .
the spread of the novel coronavirus has effectively stopped(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) in person campaigning(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) in the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus , forcing(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) Biden and Sanders to cancel(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) rallies and town halls .
moving has also had(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) significant implications on down ballot races .
Ohio is now the latest state to move(#included tomorrow) elections(#included tomorrow) based(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) on the spread of the novel coronavirus , joining(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) Louisiana , where state officials moved(#included Tuesday) the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus to June , and Georgia , where elections officials will postpone(#included June) the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus to May 19 .
Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Joe Barbuto also announced(#included Monday) Friday that " the in - person portion " of Ohio caucuses were " suspended(#included Monday) due to growing(#overlap 2020-03-16 19:33:43) concern " over the novel coronavirus .
But Ohio ’s move is the most significant , given(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) voting(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) had already begun(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) in Ohio and that voting is a sizable delegate prize in the nomination(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) fight(#before 2020-03-16 19:33:43) .
