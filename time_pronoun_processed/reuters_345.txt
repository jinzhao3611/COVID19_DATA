“ I do n’t know(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) if it ’s right to say(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) it
but I ’ve had(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) little fear , ” Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal told(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) Reuters after she and a doctor did home rounds in a taxi with plentiful gear to protect(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) both she and a doctor and she and a doctor patients .
The people she and a doctor attend(#included she) are usually virus - free and require(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) regular injections , blood pressure or other checks .
The medics wear(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) masks , visors and gloves in most cases , but have(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) full protective equipment for some patients with symptoms .
“ In order to avoid(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) the risk to patients ( from going(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) out ) , I ’ve done a lot of daily home visits(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) .
I ’ve saw(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) a lot of gratitude in she and a doctor , ” added(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal alongside doctor Carlos Balsalobre Sanchez as she and a doctor visited(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) middle - class apartments often adorned(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) with figures of Catholic saints .
“ If I ’ve do n’t take(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) care of I ’ve , I ’ve wo n’t be able to take(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) care of she and a doctor .
That ’s one of the things she and a doctor say(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) a lot , ” said(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) Balsalobre Sanchez , with an old - school leather doctor ’s bag .
But it is not all kisses(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) and gratitude for the home care crews .
Many have(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) painful memories from pandemic .
“ Seeing(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) in I ’ve diaries the little red dot next to a name ... that during pandemic meant(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) the death of our patients , has been quite hard , ” recalled(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal .
Balsalobre Sanchez , with an old - school leather doctor ’s bag ’s most poignant moment was seeing(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) an elderly couple embrace(#included she) for the last time before Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal was taken(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) to a hospital , where Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal later died(#included she) .
Another nurse , Maria Jesus Santamaria , who has been doing phone check - ups and visits , recalled(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal saying(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) “ goodbye ” by phone and asking(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal to take(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) care of Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal husband .
“ Many people have overcome(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) the illness , thank(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) God , but you take(#overlap 2020-05-29 18:47:54) overcome with you , ” Another nurse , Maria Jesus Santamaria , who has been doing phone check - ups and visits said(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) .
But her 75 - year - old patient Manuel Sanz Calderon said(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) , after taking(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) her 75 - year - old patient Manuel Sanz Calderon injections , Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal never shows(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) anything but cheeriness : “ Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal is loving , kind and Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal ca n’t say(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) more about Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal . ”
Another nurse , Maria Jesus Santamaria , who has been doing phone check - ups and visits blushes(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) when medics like Comunidad de Madrid home care nurse Ana Arenal are lauded(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) .
“ Heroes have been all of us , those who have stayed(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) at home , us doing us job , ” Another nurse , Maria Jesus Santamaria , who has been doing phone check - ups and visits said(#before 2020-05-29 18:47:54) .
