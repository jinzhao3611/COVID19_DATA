The Rise of Virtual Races .
2020-04-04 12:04:08 +00:00 .
“ Pre - Covid virtual runs tended(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) to market(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) “ Pre - Covid virtual runs on cool swag for a specific , one - time distance , ” she said(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) .
“ Post - Covid , I ’m seeing(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) a lot more longer - term challenges(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) or programs that give(#after 2020-04-04 12:04:08) people something to do over a longer period of time . ”
she cites(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) a 19 - day quarantine(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) virtual challenge(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) and a challenge(#included 2020-04-30) to run(#included 2020-04-30) 50 or 100 miles by April 30 as creative examples of new events .
Jason Hershman never put(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) on a race before but decided(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) to launch(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) a virtual run / walk to benefit(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Coronavirus Emergency Response Fund .
On May 1 , participants pledge(#included 2020-05-01) to run(#included 2020-05-01) or walk(#included 2020-05-01) for one hour and , if participants have(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) social media , share(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) participants experience online .
The cost is $ 20 .
“ During this social distance period , I still have been able to get(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) I daily runs in , which has been nice considering(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) it is spring and I am able to go(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) while the sun is out , ” said(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) Jason Hershman .
After returning(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) from one such run(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) to yet “ more awful news , ” I said(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) , I looked(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) to see(#included 2020-05-01) if there were any virtual events to raise(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) money for coronavirus relief .
When I could n’t find(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) one , I created(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) one .
I ’m seen(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) a lot of these events coming(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) online in the last few weeks , and there ’s just about something for everyone .
Matt Chittim of the Rambling Runner , for example , started(#included 2020-W13-WE) a virtual run series that began last weekend with a 5 K on March 27 to 29 .
a virtual run series that began last weekend with a 5 K on March 27 to 29 builds(#included 2020-W14-WE) to a 10k this weekend , a half marathon April 17 to 19 , and a full marathon May 15 to 17 .
Healthy Kids Running(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) is starting(#included 2020-W14-WE) a spring race series , a five week program , on April 17 for kids .
If you read(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) this in time , you can still jump(#after 2020-04-04 12:04:08) into the Personal Peak Quarantine Backyard Ultra , which starts(#included 2020-SP) today at 9 a.m. Eastern time .
Participants have(#after 2020-04-04 12:04:08) one hour to run(#after 2020-04-04 12:04:08) a 4.167 - mile loop — in Participants neighborhood , on a treadmill , or wherever Participants are .
Then , at the top of the next hour , you repeat(#included 2020-W14-WE) a 4.167 - mile loop again .
And the following(#included 2020-04) hour , again .
And again .
Last man or woman standing(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) wins(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) .
I ’m run(#before 2020-04-04 12:04:08) a race like this in the past ( in Canada , with other people ) .
It starts(#included 2020-W13-WE) out easy , then becomes(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) agony .
It ’s fun(#overlap 2020-04-04 12:04:08) .
