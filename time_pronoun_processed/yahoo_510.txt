( Bloomberg ) --
A vessel laden with Australian barley has swung(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) away from China after China slapped(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) anti - dumping duties on imports of the grain for five years amid escalating(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) bilateral tensions .
A vessel laden with Australian barley has changed(#included this month) A vessel laden with Australian barley destination from Machong port in southern China to Port of Jebel Ali in United Arab Emirates after loading(#included this month) barley from Port Lincoln in southern China this month , according to data from broker and adviser IKON Commodities and Bloomberg ship - tracking information .
A vessel laden with Australian barley was one of five vessels carrying(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) the grain with original destinations in China , data from broker and adviser IKON Commodities and Bloomberg ship - tracking information show(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) .
Australia ’s biggest barley customer is imposing(#included May 19) an anti - dumping duty of 73.6 % and an anti - subsidy duty of 6.9 % , effective from May 19 , according to China ’s Ministry of Commerce .
Industry groups are warning(#overlap 2020-05-20 03:39:04) an anti - dumping duty of 73.6 % and an anti - subsidy duty of 6.9 % will gut(#included 2017) an export market worth A$ 1.4 billion ( $ 916 million ) in 2017 .
Australia has indicated(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) Australia may appeal(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) to the World Trade Organization .
Now China ’s exports of wine , seafood , oatmeal , fruit and dairy are in danger of being targeted(#included Now) if China opts(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) for more escalation(#after 2020-05-20 03:39:04) , according to people familiar with the matter .
The scale of an anti - dumping duty of 73.6 % and an anti - subsidy duty of 6.9 % is n’t a surprise , but the five - year duration was “ longer than I or a number of trade participants would have expected(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) , ” said(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) Andrew Whitelaw , senior market analyst at Mecardo .
The immediate concern(#included Now) is for shipments already heading(#included Now) to China , said(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) I .
“ There ’s unlikely to be a lot of immediate takers so those boats will likely have to be sold(#after 2020-05-20 03:39:04) at large discounts , ” I said(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) .
There ’s a batch of grain sold(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) but not shipped(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) , which will have to be resold(#after 2020-05-20 03:39:04) at a discount .
“ For next year and for the crop we ’re planting(#included next year) at the moment , the risk is also very real , but the market has already dropped(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) to levels that make(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) us competitive in the general feed grains market , ” I said(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) .
Australia should be able to export Australia barley to other markets , as Australia displacement as a supplier to China will be significant to global trade(#after 2020-05-20 03:39:04) , said(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) Tobin Gorey , Commonwealth Bank of Australia agricultural commodities strategist .
China will have to turn(#after 2020-05-20 03:39:04) to other exporters , including(#overlap 2020-05-20 03:39:04) those in the EU and Black Sea , Canada and Argentina , for malting(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) barley used(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) in beer .
“ As China ’s brewers are forced(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) to bid(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) harder for other sources of barley , Australian barley will find(#after 2020-05-20 03:39:04) a home with those out bid(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) by China , ” I said(#before 2020-05-20 03:39:04) .
