On Tuesday , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) corrected(#included Tuesday) the number of cases reported(#included Tuesday) on island after having said(#included Tuesday) there were 13 .
At the time Taiwan had(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) only 10 .
Taiwan said(#included 2020-04-02) on Thursday there were now 13 cases .
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) a news conference that the crux of the problem was China giving(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) the wrong case number details to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
“ This was wrong information that was provided(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) by China which created(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) the mistake(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) , ” Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) .
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) Taiwan had also protested(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for again changing(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) how the World Health Organization ( WHO ) refer(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) to island , having previously called(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) it “ Taiwan , China ” , then “ Taipei ” and then just “ Taipei ” .
“ We beseech(#overlap 2020-02-06 12:23:18) the World Health Organization ( WHO ) not to put(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) Taiwan ’s information under China , creating(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) mistake(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) after mistake(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) after mistake(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) . ”
Taiwan says(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) the main consequence of that so far has been Italy including(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) Taiwan in Taiwan ban(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) on flights(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) from China .
Taiwan is not a the World Health Organization ( WHO ) member because China , says(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) China adequately represents(#overlap 2020-02-06 12:23:18) Taiwan in the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .

“ For the rapidly evolving(#overlap 2020-02-06 12:23:18) coronavirus , it is a technical imperative that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) present(#after 2020-02-06 12:23:18) visible public health data on Taiwan as an affected(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) area and engage(#overlap 2020-02-06 12:23:18) directly with Taiwan public health authorities on actions , ” Andrew Bremberg , U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva , Switzerland , told(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) the the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Executive Board .
Japan supported(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) this stance(#included 2020-04-02) , with Ambassador Ken Okaniwa telling(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) a news conference : “ We should not make(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) a geographical vacuum by creating(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) a situation where a specific region can not join(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) the World Health Organization ( WHO ) even as an observer ” .

“ If there are mistakes(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) , this is the relevant authorities in the Taiwan region deliberately reporting(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) mistakes(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) to us , ” China ’s foreign ministry said(#before 2020-02-06 12:23:18) .
