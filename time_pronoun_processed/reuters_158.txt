But while that decline(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) in market volatility will offer(#after 2020-03-24 16:49:00) some respite(#after 2020-03-24 16:49:00) to battered(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) investors , it is too soon to declare(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) that markets have bottomed(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) out after a 30 % cliff - edge drop from record highs .

Traders typically set(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) limits against potential losses(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) in Traders operations(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) by calculating(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) VaR - a statistical measure used(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) to quantify(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) an expected loss(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) over a specified(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) horizon at a certain confidence level in normal markets .

Based(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) on previous market volatility and return metrics , a lower The Cboe Volatility Index , known as Wall Street ’s fear gauge , reading would encourage(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) traders to raise(#after 2020-03-24 16:49:00) the size of traders trading positions in a low volatility environment , and vice versa .

“ We are moving(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) 4 % a day and 4 % a day is unhealthy .
I think(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) that vol needs(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) to stabilize(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) before the broader market can heal(#after 2020-03-24 16:49:00) , ” Morgan Stanley in London ’s I added(#before 2020-03-24 16:49:00) .
