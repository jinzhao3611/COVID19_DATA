" This moment , let 's be honest , has revealed(#included this week) cracks , shortages .
Like every country in the world , France have lacked(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) gloves , hand gel , France have n't been able to give(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) out as many masks as France wanted(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) to France health professionals . "

But if French hospitals are just about coping(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) , helped(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) by a massive effort to transfer(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) patients by plane , helicopter or even high - speed train from hospitals in the east and Paris to the west , nursing homes have been overwhelmed(#before 2020-04-14 00:15:36) .
