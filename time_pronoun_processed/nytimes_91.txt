Julie Reiner , a partner in Pegu Club , confirmed(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) the closing(#included Thursday) .
When Pegu Club opened(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) , there were few craft cocktail bars around NYC .
The growing(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) movement coalesced(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) around one of the most influential cocktail bars in the world .
Though Pegu Club was opened(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) by a group of partners , Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder emerged(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) as the bar ’s figurehead .

Toby Maloney , Phil Ward , Jim Meehan , Brian Miller , Chad Solomon — all of whom would eventually open(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) their own cocktail bars .
Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder became(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) renowned(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) for the seriousness Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder brought(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) to Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder craft , testing(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) dozens of versions of the same cocktail before finding(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) the one Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder deemed(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) worthy of being the Pegu Club version .
Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder fought(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) to get(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) products then unavailable in New York City that Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder felt(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) were needed(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) to make the best drinks possible , such as Laird ’s bonded apple brandy and Rittenhouse rye whiskey .
The menu was a mix of forgotten(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) classics ( including(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) the Pegu Club , an old gin cocktail named(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) after a British club in Rangoon ) and Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder own modern inventions , such as the Gin - Gin Mule , Old Cuban and Little Italy , which went(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) on to become(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) modern classics in their own right .
The staff was at the front line of a yearslong battle(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) to recalibrate(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) the public ’s taste , steering(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) then away from safe choices like a vodka and soda or rum and Coke , and introducing(#included 2016) The staff to pisco punch and the 50/50 martini ( a vermouth - heavy variation of the martini that was popularized there ) .
As the cocktail boom continued(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) and relaxed(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) the cocktail boom rules and attitudes a bit , Pegu Club remained(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) true to Pegu Club original standards , the menu rarely changing(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) , the bartenders forever in vests , everything just so .

“ Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder wanted(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) to change(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) drinking history .
change is a revolution(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) .
Audrey Saunders , the bar ’s co - founder knew(#before 2020-04-30 14:58:47) that if The staff did n’t do change right then people would be , ‘ Oh , it was n’t all that . ’ ”
