New York Stock Exchange traders hope(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to prove(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) New York Stock Exchange traders are still a big noise .
2020-05-23 23:10:02 +00:00 .
Everyone knows(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) what financial trading(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) looks(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) like , right ?
A large room of blokes ( mainly ) with paunches and worryingly high blood pressure who shout(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) and wave(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) against a backdrop of flashing(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) electronic numbers .
In reality the vast majority of trades(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) are done by computers away from the floor , but that scene remains(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) the enduring image of stock markets – one made(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) familiar by films such as Trading Places .
Which is why a line from that 1983 movie is being used(#included 1983) to trail(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) the partial return(#included this week) to open(#included 1983) outcry(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) trading(#included this week) on the New York Stock Exchange this week , after the physical floor ( but not the electronic market ) was closed(#included March) in March as part of the coronavirus lockdown(#included March) .
“ We ’re back , Mortimer , ” was how veteran floor trader Peter “ Einstein of Wall Street ”
Tuchman put(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) it .
Tuchman is recovering(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) from a nasty bout(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) of the virus Tuchman , so it is difficult to begrudge(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) Tuchman Tuchman enthusiasm .
But is this week ’s return(#included this week) of open outcry(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) trading(#included this week) at the New York Stock Exchange – where safety concerns will only permit(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) about 25 % of the normal numbers of brokers back – really such a big deal ?
In normal times there tend(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to be two views of the NYSE ’s physical trading floor , a feature many other bourses have long abandoned(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) .
To NYSE supporters , NYSE is an important and more sophisticated adjunct to the vast majority of market trades , which are conducted(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) by machines .
If an investor wants(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to buy(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) a stock at $ 10 , the computer will quickly find(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) a seller and make(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) that trade .
But a human on the exchange floor would talk(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to other traders and might discover(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) lots of potential sellers milling(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) around , and use(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) other traders judgment(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to decide(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) whether it is worth waiting(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to see(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) if the price falls(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) .
“ It ’s the difference between [ takeaway ] delivery(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) and going(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to a restaurant , where you can look(#included 1983) at the menu and talk(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to the waiter about the specials , ” floor trader Steve Grasso told(#included last month) the Washington Post last month .
“ You get(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) your food either way .
But you get(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) an inferior experience if you do n’t go(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to the restaurant . ”
floor trader Steve Grasso is a bit of a Wall Street television celebrity , which brings(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) us to the opposing(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) view of the physical trading floor : that the physical trading floor is a shameless marketing ploy , useful only as a backdrop for the network ’s financial news bulletins .
The viewers expect(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) a trading floor , damn a trading floor , so we ’ll give(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) The viewers a trading(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) floor .
This expectation can also get(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) turned(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) up a notch during crises , when Wall Street suddenly morphs(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) into a symbol of the American way of life .
After the 11 September 2001 attacks(#included 11 September 2001) , the exchanges(#included 11 September 2001) closed(#included 11 September 2001) down completely , but the markets swiftly reopened(#included 11 September 2001) ( before , predictably , slumping(#included 11 September 2001) ) and then New York mayor Rudy Giuliani memorably described(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) Wall Street as a “ monument to our liberty” .
It was tricky(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) to argue(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) with New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , and now that New York mayor Rudy Giuliani ’s President Donald Trump ’s lawyer , one wonders(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) if New York mayor Rudy Giuliani will be back this week to mark(#included this week) the rebirth of open outcry(#overlap 2020-05-23 23:10:02) .
If New York mayor Rudy Giuliani does make(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) a trip to the trading floor , New York mayor Rudy Giuliani will need(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) ( depending on where New York mayor Rudy Giuliani gets(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) New York mayor Rudy Giuliani medical advice ) a pen for signing(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) the inevitable document indemnifying(#before 2020-05-23 23:10:02) the New York Stock Exchange against potential lawsuits(#after 2020-05-23 23:10:02) , a hydroxychloroquine bagel and a hip flask of bleach .
