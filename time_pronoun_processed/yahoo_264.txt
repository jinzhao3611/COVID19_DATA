The captain on the Diamond Princess was n't assertive enough in taking(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) steps to prevent(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the coronavirus from spreading(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) on the Diamond Princess , according to cruise - industry expert Ross Klein .
" The captain on the Diamond Princess had(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the ability to segregate(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) crew members who may have been ill from those who were n't ill or to find(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) ways of ensuring(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) that crew members who potentially were ill were not eating(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) at the same crew mess as the people who were n't ill , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) of The captain on the Diamond Princess .
But Princess Cruises did make(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) a smart decision by canceling(#included May 10) all cruises(#before 2020-03-13) through May 10 , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) .
Princess Cruises did not immediately respond(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) to a request(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) for comment(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) .

Before canceling(#included May 10) all of Business Insider 's cruises(#included May 10) through May 10 , Princess Cruises received(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) criticism for its handling of a coronavirus outbreak on its Diamond Princess ship that eventually infected over 700 passengers and crew members .
The biggest mistake(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) made(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) by Princess Cruises came(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) from those running(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the Diamond Princess , like The captain on the Diamond Princess , said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) Ross Klein , a professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland who studies(#overlap 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the cruise industry and runs(#overlap 2020-03-13 17:07:01) a website documenting(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) illness outbreaks(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) on cruise ships .
The captain on the Diamond Princess was n't proactive(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) enough in taking(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) steps to protect(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) passengers and crew members , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) , leaning(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) instead on the Japanese government , which imposed(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) a quarantine(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) over three days after learning(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) that a prior passenger on the ship had tested(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) positive for the coronavirus .
" a prior passenger on the ship had(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the ability to segregate(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) crew members who may have been ill from those who were n't ill or to find(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) ways of ensuring(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) that crew members who potentially were ill were not eating(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) at the same crew mess as the people who were n't ill , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) of The captain on the Diamond Princess .
Princess Cruises did not immediately respond(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) to a request(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) for comment(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) .
Being more decisive may not have stopped(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the coronavirus from spreading(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) on the Diamond Princess , but Being could have at least slowed(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the coronavirus down , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) .
While Princess Cruises mishandled(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the Diamond Princess , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) Princess Cruises did make(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) a smart decision by canceling(#before May 11) all of its cruises until May 10 .
" cruise - industry expert Ross Klein think(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) canceling was a very wise move(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) .
" cruise - industry expert Ross Klein think(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) it 's unfortunate that it took(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) all of its cruises this long and that the remainder of the companies within Carnival Corp. and others have n't seen(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) the value in taking(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) that kind of an approach . "
Ultimately , Princess Cruises is n't likely to suffer(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) long - term reputational damage from its handling of a coronavirus outbreak on its Diamond Princess ship that eventually infected over 700 passengers and crew members , cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) , pointing(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) to Holland America Line , which recovered(#included 2002) after multiple norovirus outbreaks(#included 2002) in 2002 .
" Within a year , people pretty much forgot(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) , " cruise - industry expert Ross Klein said(#before 2020-03-13 17:07:01) .
