The highest volatility in a decade has trounced(#included this year) carry traders and is pushing(#overlap 2020-03-11 06:15:01) a momentum - based approach to the fore .
Amid the coronavirus shock , an oil - price war(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) and turmoil in equities , turbulence in Japan ’s currency reached(#included this year) levels unseen since 2008 this week .
Even after a resurgence(#included Tuesday) of risk appetite Tuesday , there ’s little doubt about what ’s worked(#included this year) for investors this week : The trend - following strategy is up 9.5 % , while carry trades(#included this year) have lost(#included this year) 7.4 % , according to Deutsche Bank AG data .

In the past few weeks , investors have exited(#included the past few weeks) riskier , higher - yielding currencies and piled(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) into the yen , a favored oasis for investors in times of stress .

“ The carry trade is lost(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) in the uncertainty surrounding(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) the virus , collapse(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) in oil prices and global growth(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) , ” said(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) Paresh Upadhyaya , a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management .

Carry has been the “ stark underperformer ” as thinner liquidity means “ position unwinds have been able to impact(#before 2020-03-11 06:15:01) price action to a greater degree , ” Meera Chandan , a strategist at JPMorgan Chase Co. , wrote(#included Tuesday) in a note to clients emailed(#included Tuesday) Tuesday .
