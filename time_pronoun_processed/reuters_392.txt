The United Kingdom on Tuesday announced(#included Tuesday) a new post - Brexit tariff regime to replace(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) the European Union ’s external tariff , maintaining(#included Tuesday) a 10 % tariff on cars but cutting(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) levies on tens of billions of dollars of supply chain imports .
After decades outsourcing(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) The United Kingdom trade policy to EU , The United Kingdom is embarking(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) on negotiating(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) free trade agreements(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) with countries around the world and aims(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) to have(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) deals in place covering(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) 80 % of British trade within three years .

new post-Brexit global tariff regime will apply(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) to countries with which The United Kingdom has(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) no agreement and will remove(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) all tariffs below 2 % .
“ the EU ’s Common External Tariff will benefit(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) UK consumers and households by cutting(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) red tape and reducing(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) the cost of thousands of everyday products , ” International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) .
the EU ’s Common External Tariff will be set(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) in pounds and will be legislated(#included January 2021) for later in the year and will come(#included January 2021) into force from January 2021 .
Under the new regime tariffs would be eliminated(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) on a wide range of products : 60 % of trade will come(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) into the European Union ’s external tariff free on WTO terms or through existing(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) preferential access , The United Kingdom said(#included Tuesday) .
UK will maintain(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) tariffs on a number of products backing(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) UK industries such as agriculture , automotive and fishing .
UK will remove(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) tariffs on 30 billion pounds ( $ 37 billion ) worth of imports entering(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) UK supply chains such as screws and bolts .
The United Kingdom said(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) The United Kingdom would also remove(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) tariffs on products which support(#overlap 2020-05-19 06:53:14) energy efficiency such as thermostats and LED lamps , and will introduce(#after 2020-05-19 06:53:14) a temporary zero tariff rate on products being use(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) to fight(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) the COVID-19 outbreak(#before 2020-05-19 06:53:14) such as personal protective equipment .
