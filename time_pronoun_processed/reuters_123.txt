LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain has placed(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) an emergency order of 10,000 ventilators designed at breakneck speed by bagless vacuum cleaner company Dyson , the first fruits of an industry - wide call(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) to arms to prepare(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) for the looming(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) peak of the coronavirus outbreak(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) .

In another industry effort , a consortium of companies in the aerospace and engineering sectors are working(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) with seven Formula One racing teams to ramp up production(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) of existing(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) ventilator models , with a manufacturing launch date penned(#included March 30) in for March 30 .
Ahead of an expected surge(#included early next month) of cases that could overwhelm(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) Britain ’s publicly funded health service , Prime Minister Boris Johnson made(#included 10 days ago) an urgent appeal to manufacturers 10 days ago to build(#included March 23 , 2020) ventilators to help(#included 10 days ago) keep(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) patients alive .
Production of Dyson ’s new CoVent ventilator could start(#included early next month) early next month but the government made(#included Wednesday evening) clear an emergency order of 10,000 ventilators designed at breakneck speed by bagless vacuum cleaner company Dyson was dependent(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) on Dyson ’s new CoVent ventilator passing(#included March 30) safety and regulatory tests(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) .
“ The core challenge(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) was how to design(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) and deliver(#included March 23 , 2020) a new , sophisticated medical product in volume and in an extremely short space of time , ” vacuum-maker Dyson said(#included Wednesday evening) on Wednesday evening in an email to staff seen(#included Wednesday evening) by Reuters .
“ The race is now on to get(#included now) a new , sophisticated medical product into production(#included now) . ”
vacuum-maker Dyson is able(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) to draw(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) on the company ’s expertise in air movement , motors , power systems , manufacturing and supply chains to design(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) and build(#after 2020-03-26 14:24:03) an entirely new ventilator .
vacuum-maker Dyson revolutionised(#included the 1990s) the vacuum cleaner market with vacuum-maker Dyson bagless cyclonic device in the 1990s and has since gone(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) on to build(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) air purifiers , hand dryers and fans from vacuum-maker Dyson base in southwest England and manufacturing(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) plants in Malaysia , Singapore and the Philippines .

a consortium of companies in the aerospace and engineering sectors , meanwhile , includes(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) such names as Rolls - Royce ( RR.L ) , BAE ( BAES.L ) , Airbus ( AIR.PA ) and Siemens UK which will help(#after 2020-03-26 14:24:03) existing(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) medical device makers such as Penlon and Smiths Group to ramp up production .
a consortium of companies in the aerospace and engineering sectors is waiting(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) for the green light from government .
British engineer Babcock ( BAB.L ) has also joined(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) forces with a leading medical equipment company and experts from London ’s Royal Brompton Hospital .
a leading medical equipment company and experts from London ’s Royal Brompton Hospital have all sprung(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) into action after the government said(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) the government needed(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) another 30,000 ventilators to save(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) the lives of patients who develop(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) complications with COVID-19 .
the government is also acquiring(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) the life - saving devices from private hospitals and international producers .
Britain currently has(#included currently) about 8,000 ventilators with another 8,000 on order to come(#included currently) into the health system in about a week
By 0900 GMT on Wednesday some 9,529 people had tested(#included Wednesday) positive for the virus in the United Kingdom while 463 patients had died(#included Wednesday) .
Britain has also bought(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) 3.5 million antibody testing kits - largely used(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) to determine(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) if someone has already had(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) the virus - and is currently making(#included currently) sure someone work(#included currently) before distributing(#included currently) someone .
Prototypes of an antibody test which could be a game - changer in the fight(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) against the pandemic(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) are being assessed(#overlap 2020-03-26 14:24:03) and are ready to be optimised(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) , the developer of the technology said(#included Thursday) on Thursday .
Many staff within the National Health Service ( NHS ) have not been tested(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) , a major concern for health workers and a cause of mounting(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) criticism(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) of the government ’s response(#before 2020-03-26 14:24:03) .
