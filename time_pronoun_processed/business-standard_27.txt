" Business Standard are ensuring(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) that milk procurement(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) from farmers continues(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) with safety measures(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) being taken(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) .

But reach should be gradually sorted(#after 2020-03-25 06:01:51) out as Business Standard have(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) all the permissions in place and are in touch with the relevant authorities , " said(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi .
In inter - state transport , Gujarat Co - operative Milk Marketing Federation ( GCMMF ) , popularly known as Amul is facing(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) delay(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) in empty trucks coming(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) back from other states to Gujarat after delivering(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) milk .
While trucks full with milk and milk products are being allowed(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) to pass(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) inter - state borders , returning(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) empty trucks are facing(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) delayed(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) re - entry due to lockdown(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) .
Along with other states , Gujarat had also begun(#included 2020-03-22) sealing(#included 2020-03-22) inter - state borders by March 22 .
" Business Standard saw(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) that trucks that go(#included daily) full are allowed(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) at state borders but empty trucks coming(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) back face(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) problem at entry(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) , " GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi added(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) .
In terms of transport , is also facing(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) issues in supply of ingredients for cattle feed .
While some of ingredients for cattle feed are available within Gujarat , Amul 's cattle feed(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) plants source raw materials like rice bran , corn , millet , and molasses from other states like Punjab , Haryana and Rajasthan .
" ingredients for cattle feed are crucial so that we can supply(#after 2020-03-25 06:01:51) cattle feed to farmers so that milk procurement is not hampered(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) , " GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi said(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) .
Another issue that could hamper(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) Amul 's supplies is packaging(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) material .
" No factory gives(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) more than a fortnight of packaging material .
ingredients for cattle feed should also be allowed(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) to operate(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) and there workers should be provided(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) free movement so that milk and food items ' packaging supplies do not take(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) a hit . "
According to GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi , while so far these issues have not had(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) any major impact on Amul 's supplies , Gujarat Co - operative Milk Marketing Federation ( GCMMF ) , popularly known as Amul has made(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) representations to relevant authorities to ensure(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) smooth supplies of milk and milk products .
Meanwhile , in a video message being circulated(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) on social media , GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi is also urging(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) consumers to not resort(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) to panic(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) buying(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) amidst 21-day lockdown .
" GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi want(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) to reassure(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) our Amul consumers that GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi have read(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) the Ministry of Home Affairs ' notification(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) in detail in which milk and other food items and grocery stores are allowed(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) to remain(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) open .
And in Gujarat we see(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) roughly 30 million litres per day of milk production(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) which if you divide(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) by a population of 60 million in Gujarat then 500 ml per person milk is available .
So there is going(#after 2020-03-25 06:01:51) to be no shortage of milk .
Milk parlours will remain(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) open .
So GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi request(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) our Amul consumers to not get(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) into panic buying(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) and buy(#overlap 2020-03-25 06:01:51) only as much is required(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) each day , " GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi urged(#before 2020-03-25 06:01:51) consumers .
