an unprecedented rout as investors flee for havens assets amid the global market meltdown exceeds(#overlap 2020-03-26 21:16:07) the prior record of $ 35.6 billion set(#included last week) just last week as the selloff(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) from the spreading(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) coronavirus intensified(#included last week) .
Fund outflows had been expected(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) to ease(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) after credit markets rallied(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) in line with equities as a $ 2 trillion relief bill moved(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) a $ 2 trillion relief bill way through Congress , following(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) news that the Federal Reserve would buy(#after 2020-03-26 21:16:07) corporate bonds .

“ Liquidity preservation was the goal(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) , hence its biggest losses in at least four decades . ”

“ There ’s a lot of momentum around the the Federal Reserve facilities and the stimulus bill , but ’s does n’t take(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) away all of the negative numbers that are yet to come(#after 2020-03-26 21:16:07) , ” said(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) Erin Lyons , U.S. credit strategist at CreditSights in a telephone interview(#before 2020-03-26 21:16:07) .
