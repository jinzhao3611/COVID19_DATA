No more loans, what the consumer is really looking(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) for is a tax holiday .

At a time when the economy is likely to see(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) a severe contraction(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) , we continue(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) to apply(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) band - aid .
There was hope after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) a Rs 20 - trillion package , roughly translating(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) into 10 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product .
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's Rs 21 trillion largesse does n’t translate(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) into more cash - in - hand for most .
For example , the Rs 3 - trillion central government guaranteed(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) credit line for micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSME ) sounds(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) great .
After all , there will be a moratorium(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) of one year .
But the interest will accumulate(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) for one year and will have to be paid(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) later .
Yes , MSMEs are facing(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) severe problems due to cash crunch , but will MSMEs borrow(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) more , produce(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) goods and pay(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) salaries in these uncertain times ?
Let ’s see(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) .
Similarly , the two per cent reduction in Employee Provident Fund benefit for employers and employees will not give(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) too much benefit to either .
Anyway , the two per cent reduction in Employee Provident Fund benefit for employers and employees is only for three months .
The Indian economy was already suffering(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) from a downturn(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) before the Covid crisis(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) hit(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) us .
Last September , the government gave(#included 2019-09) hefty tax sops to India Inc.
Result : Due to the reduction(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) in tax liabilities , the price - to - earnings ratio improved(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) .
The markets cheered(#included 2019-09) for a few days .
But as days went(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) by , there was a clear realisation(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) that no fresh investments(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) will happen(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) because there was no demand .
At the same time , non - banking financial companies went(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) into deeper stress as people stopped(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) borrowing(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) and there was a general fear about lending money to non - banking financial companies .
When the skeletons came(#included 2019-09) out of the cupboards , the realisation(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) dawned(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) that many of the skeletons were riding(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) tigers .
For example , the monthly interest liability of a non - banking financial company was Rs 1,500 crore on a loan book of around Rs 1 lakh crore .
This NBFC was clearly raising(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) money at an unaffordable rate during a falling interest rate regime .
Then , Covid-19 happened(#included 2019-09) .
And the lockdown began(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) .
Now , after 50 days of the lockdown , a grand stimulus package has been announced(#included PRESENT_REF) .
But a grand stimulus package again focusses(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) mostly on the supply side , and reforms that will give(#included 2020-05-19) results in months or years later .
Meanwhile , demand has suffered(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) badly .
Most companies , barring(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) an odd Asian Paints , have announced(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) salary or job cuts(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) … some of Most companies severe ones .
Even the central and state governments have cut(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) salaries so one can not blame(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) the private sector only .
So , in terms of income , an upper middle class family will most likely going(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) to be downgraded(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) to middle class , middle class to lower middle class and so on .
So car companies can make(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) cars , builders may build(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) houses , banks may lower(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) interest rates , malls may open(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) and there could be grand discounts at the best hotels , but few would be able to or interested(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) in spending(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) on such luxuries .
The ones who do are n’t dependent on salaries but dividend incomes .
Instead , there will be downtrading(#after 2020-05-19 11:38:33) .
A Pears soap user may go(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) for Lux .
And a Lux user may seek(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) comfort in Lifebuoy .
Managing(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) such times is an ‘ out of syllabus exercise(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) ’ for any government .
But this could be a good time for free lunches and tax holidays .
A one - year tax income holiday for everyone or up to a certain salary level is likely to ensure(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) that people do n’t down trade(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) or defer(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) basic expenses(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) .
Yes , a car or home buying(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) may not happen(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) immediately , but even being able to maintain(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) the existing(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) lifestyle will help(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) growth(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) and India Inc.
Few would want(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) a loan currently , but most need(#included PRESENT_REF) a free lunch .
Since the nineties , successive governments have sold(#after 199) the ‘ middle - class spending power ’ dream to attract(#before 2020-05-19 11:38:33) investments(#included 199) from global companies .
It ’s time to protect(#overlap 2020-05-19 11:38:33) the ‘ middle - class spending power ’ dream .
