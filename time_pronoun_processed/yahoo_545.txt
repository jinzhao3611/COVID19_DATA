China has published(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) a second batch of products to be exempt from US trade war(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) tariffs , effective from May 19 for one year .
There are 79 products in total on the list published(#included Tuesday) on Tuesday by the Ministry of Finance , including(#included Tuesday) rare earth mineral ores , aircraft radar equipment , semiconductor parts , medical disinfectants , and a range of precious metals , chemical and petrochemical products .

the announcement comes(#included last week) at a heated moment for the United States and China , with sharpened rhetoric prevalent on the United States and China .
US President Donald Trump last week threatened(#included last week) to tear(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) up the phase one trade deal , signed in January , should China not increase(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) China imports of US goods , as per the purchasing(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) agreement(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) element of the phase one trade deal , signed in January , .

Given that China imported(#included September 2019) much fewer goods from China in 2019 than China did in 2017 – the baseline scenario used(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) to map(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) out the terms of the phase one trade deal , signed in January , – China is nowhere near meeting(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) the targets .
An editorial in the state - run Global Times on Monday suggested(#included Tuesday) that dissenting voices within and advising(#overlap 2020-05-12 06:54:37) China were pushing(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) for renegotiation(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) of the phase one trade deal , signed in January , , a suggestion(#included Tuesday) that was swiftly shot(#included Tuesday) down by US President Donald Trump at a press conference(#included Tuesday) in Washington on Monday .
Among the other US goods to be offered(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) exemptions from trade(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) war(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) tariffs are recombinant human insulin , halogen light bulbs for trains , ships and aircraft , electricity generators , flight data recorders , certain digital cameras , and gold ore .
Top negotiators including China ’s Vice - Premier Liu He and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held(#included Tuesday) a telephone call on Friday , the first since the phase one trade deal , signed in January , was signed(#included January) in January .
A Chinese statement(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) carried(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) by state media said(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) Top negotiators including China ’s Vice - Premier Liu He and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would “ create(#after 2020-05-12 06:54:37) favourable conditions to implement(#after 2020-05-12 06:54:37) the phase one trade deal , signed in January , , at a time when superpower tensions have been running(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) high over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak .
In a statement(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) posted(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) to the state - run Global Times website , the Office of the US Trade Representative added(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) that “ the United States and China agreed(#before 2020-05-12 06:54:37) that good progress is being made(#overlap 2020-05-12 06:54:37) on creating(#overlap 2020-05-12 06:54:37) the governmental infrastructures necessary to make(#after 2020-05-12 06:54:37) the phase one trade deal , signed in January , a success . ”
