The 'zoom parliament' could inspire(#after 2020-04-26 16:12:54) a more democratic Commons | Richard Power Sayeed .
2020-04-26 16:12:54 +00:00 .
Émile Durkheim argued(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) that traditions , along with other social institutions , exist(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) because traditions , along with other social institutions do some kind of job for society as a whole .
Accordingly , in parliament , the dress codes for MPs , the ermine , the gilded this and that , the bobbing(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) and the bowing(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) , are all said(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) to encourage(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) both lawmakers and citizens to take(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) what happens(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) in Westminster seriously .
If you watch(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) a standard prime minister ’s questions , which for centuries has been dominated(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) by a baying(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) mob of former public school boys , you might get(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the feeling that traditions are n’t always collectively beneficial .
But our new and decidedly untraditional “ Zoom parliament ” has transformed(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the Commons .
While MPs are still required(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) to wear(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) appropriate clothing and some politicians have decorated(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) some politicians webcam backdrops with MPs own fancy accessories , remote working has largely stripped(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) parliament of remote working customs and costumes .
our have been confronted(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) with the bare bones of our representative system , and the result has been overwhelmingly positive .
Wednesday ’s PMQs was like never before .
No facile insults were screamed(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) .
There was no sonic wall of jeering(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) .
There were only a handful of MPs in the chamber , and those joining online were muted(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) by the clerks until it was those joining online turn to ask(#included Wednesday) a question .
Consequently , with the exception of some quiet “ Hear hears ” , almost no one spoke(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) until those joining online were invited(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) to by the Speaker , Lindsay Hoyle .
This week the Commons looked(#included This week) , for the first time in a long while , like the epicentre of a grownup democracy , sensible and pleasingly boring .
As for the rest of parliamentary business : select committees , ministerial statements , debates(#included PRESENT_REF) and questions from MPs are now all taking(#included PRESENT_REF) place online .
Votes have been postponed(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) for the moment , and plans for a digital system are being developed(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) , so that the whips wo n’t have to force(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) hundreds of MPs and peers , some of hundreds of MPs and peers potentially infectious with Covid-19 , into the lobbies .
parliament ’s old guard are n’t wrong(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) to worry(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) that a working - from - home parliament will lack(#after 2020-04-26 16:12:54) some creative spontaneity as MPs are unable to take(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) ministers to task(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) with off - the - cuff questions .
But look at these reforms(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) from the perspective of people for whom evenings and days spent(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) away from home are unrealistic .
The ability to work(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) remotely may open(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) up a career in politics to a more diverse cohort of MPs .
We ’ll need(#after 2020-04-26 16:12:54) more reform than this – allowing(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) MPs to take(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) parental leave is particularly key – but more remote working(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) is a start(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) .
We want(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) MPs to be able to see(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) MPs families , sending(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) a signal that a better work / life balance is key to a happier society .
And We want(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) MPs to spend(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) time in MPs communities , because We need(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) MPs to represent(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the interests of people who have too often been ignored(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) by politics .
In that case , the benefits of making(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) parliament accessible surely outweigh(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the costs .
These changes have civilised(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the Commons and have(#included PRESENT_REF) the potential to make(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) British politics more democratic and representative .
But if all this is not to be swept(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) away when lockdown(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) eventually ends(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) , then modernising(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) MPs and the Speaker , Lindsay Hoyle must make(#after 2020-04-26 16:12:54) many aspects of our new and decidedly untraditional “ Zoom parliament ” permanent .
We ’ll be waiting(#after 2020-04-26 16:12:54) a long time for some reforms(#after 2020-04-26 16:12:54) , like an elected(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) second chamber and a more egalitarian party system that suppresses(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) Westminster ’s bullying(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) culture .
But there ’s plenty to do in the meantime .
Émile Durkheim was wrong(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) .
Traditions exist(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) not because Traditions benefit society , but because Traditions benefit(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) those who hold(#overlap 2020-04-26 16:12:54) power .
So move(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the ermine to a museum and leave(#before 2020-04-26 16:12:54) the gilding in a gallery .
