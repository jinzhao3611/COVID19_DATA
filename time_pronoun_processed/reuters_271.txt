- Japan will unveil(#included 2020-03-31) on Tuesday a second package of measures to offset the impact of a coronavirus outbreak , focusing on support for small businesses , Finance Minister Taro Aso said(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) , as concerns mount(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) about risks to the fragile economy .
However , Finance Minister Taro Aso said(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) there was no need yet for a bigger extra budget , since the fallout was not so widespread as that of the 2009 financial crisis(#included 2009) , despite politicians ’ growing(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) calls for large fiscal spending .
To help(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) fund(#after 2020-03-10 08:17:59) a second package of measures to offset the impact of a coronavirus outbreak , focusing on support for small businesses , Japan will tap(#included this fiscal year) the rest of this fiscal year ’s budget reserve of about 270 billion yen , two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) Reuters .
a second package of measures to offset the impact of a coronavirus outbreak , focusing on support for small businesses underscores(#included March 18) the pressure(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) on policymakers to shore(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) up fragile growth(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) and stem(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) the risk of corporate bankruptcies , as event cancellations(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) and a tourism slump threaten(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) to hit(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) the fragile economy hard .
tap is likely to affect(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) the Bank of Japan ’s decision(#included March 10) on steps to underpin(#included March 18) the fragile economy at the Bank of Japan ’s March 18 - 19 policy review .

“ There ’s no saying(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) ” whether Japan needs(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) an extra budget .
FINANCIAL SUPPORT
As well as support for businesses , a second package of measures to offset the impact of a coronavirus outbreak , focusing on support for small businesses will beef(#after 2020-03-10 08:17:59) up medical facilities and provide(#after 2020-03-10 08:17:59) subsidies to parents who must take(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) leave because of closed schools , Finance Minister Taro Aso said(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) .
a second package of measures to offset the impact of a coronavirus outbreak , focusing on support for small businesses will focus(#after 2020-03-10 08:17:59) on small and tiny businesses which face(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) the need of financing over the next two to three weeks , ” Finance Minister Taro Aso said(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) .
The financial watchdog has urged(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) credit associations and regional banks to hold(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) hearings with small businesses about small businesses financial situation , Finance Minister Taro Aso added(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) .

As part of a second package of measures to offset the impact of a coronavirus outbreak , focusing on support for small businesses , Finance Minister Taro Aso has said(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) a government - affiliated lender would offer(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) funds effectively at no interest and without collateral to small firms whose sales(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) slumped(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) in a coronavirus outbreak .
a coronavirus outbreak has infected(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) more than 111,000 people and killed(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) more than 3,800 globally , with the accompanying(#included 2014) economic disruption(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) undermining(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) Japan ’s export - led economy .

a coronavirus outbreak has prompted(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) heavy selling(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) of riskier assets and a scramble(#overlap 2020-03-10 08:17:59) into assets such as the yen , perceived(#before 2020-03-10 08:17:59) as safe havens during times of financial distress .
