Terrible week for financial markets , 11,000 last ray of hope
It ’s been a week(#Depend-on 2020-03-02 03:09:42) of distress , intimidation(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) and a lot of uncertainties for all equity across the globe .
Until last week , probably no one had sensed(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) how massive the overall adverse effect of Coronavirus would be .
The moment Coronavirus started(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) spreading(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) rapidly outside China , things became(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) worse and started eventually resulted(#included 2020-04-02) into a complete meltdown in global For us , we saw(#included 2020-04-02) some hope of revival(#included 2020-04-02) on Thursday but Friday ’s huge gap down followed(#included 2020-04-02) by sustained selling(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) poured(#included 2020-04-02) water on Coronavirus .
Eventually , we concluded(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) by registering(#after 2008) the biggest weekly cut(#after 2008) after 2008 .
There was no respect(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) shown(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) for any major support as we saw(#included 2020-04-02) breaching(#included 2020-04-02) of crucial points one after another .
Honestly speaking(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) , no analysis(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) works(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) in such kind of fearsome environment .
Although , the next path of action is solely dependent(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) on further developments(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) with respect to coronavirus ; but still , let(#included PRESENT_REF) us see(#included PRESENT_REF) where we stand(#included PRESENT_REF) now and what are the next key levels to watch(#included PRESENT_REF) .
At present , we are placed(#included PRESENT_REF) precisely at the 161 per cent retracement of the recent up move(#included PRESENT_REF) from 11,614.50 to 12,246.70 .
In case(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) if the Nifty slides further , then the last ray of hope would be the lower end of multi - year ‘ Upward Sloping Channel ’ placed(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) at 11,000 .
On the upside(#included 2020-W14) , Friday ’s huge gap area of 11,384.80 – 11,536.70 remains(#included 2020-04-03) to be an immediate hurdle .
In our sense , if any sustainable recovery has to happen(#included 2020-W14) this week , any sustainable recovery should be V - shaped or steep in nature .
If be does n’t happen(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) and if the recovery is gradual , happen would be an ominous sign(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) for the bulls .
Momentum traders are advised(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) to stay(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) light and should avoid(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) leveraged positions in such kind of global uncertainty .
But having said(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) that , historically it ’s been proven(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) that such panics(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) generally offer(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) very good opportunity for investors who are willing to build their portfolio .
Hence , one should start(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) nibbling(#overlap 2020-03-02 03:09:42) into quality propositions(#before 2020-03-02 03:09:42) .
