( Bloomberg ) --
New Jersey has sent(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) guidance to hospitals on how to allocate(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) scarce ventilators among gravely ill patients stricken(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) with the new coronavirus .
Medical professionals should take(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) into account patients ’ likelihood of surviving(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) until discharge(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) and any other conditions that may limit(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) life expectancy .
Those medical objectives , rather than factors such as age and race , should determine(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) the need to assign(#after 2020-04-14 11:52:55) ventilators to patients , according to Governor Phil Murphy .
“ No discrimination(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) of any kind , ” Governor Phil Murphy said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
Triage may occur(#after 2020-04-14 11:52:55) only during a “ crisis standard of care ” at 72 hospitals that treat(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) acute patients , Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) at a Trenton news conference(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
New Jersey has received(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) 1,550 ventilators and needs(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) 950 more from the federal stockpile , administration officials said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
Medical ethicists have wrestled(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) with similar choices as pandemic spread .
The New England Journal of Medicine published(#included last month) guidance last month by a group of medical experts who suggested(#included last month) prioritizing(#included last month) medical workers and patients with the best chance of recovery .
New Jersey officials are girding(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) medical workers even as New Jersey ’s rate of new cases and deaths(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) have slowed(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
Persichilli and Murphy said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) Persichilli and Murphy do n’t believe(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) guidance will be necessary .
Ventilator Demand
guidance require(#included April 11) staffs not to triage(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) ventilators until staffs exhaust(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) staffs supplies of any machines capable of mechanically delivering(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) oxygen , including(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) anesthesia machines and continuous positive air - pressure machines of the kind used(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) by sleep - apnea sufferers , Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said .
Thousands of such machines are available(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
As of Sunday night , 7,781 residents were hospitalized(#included Sunday night) in New Jersey in relation to Covid-19 .
About 55 % of New Jersey ’s traditional ventilators are in use by 1,611 Covid-19 patients , according to state data .
Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) one of the most dire case models predicted(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) that 36,000 people would be hospitalized(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) , with more than one - sixth on ventilators .
The discharge(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) rate , meanwhile , was about 14 % , up from 11 % the day before , showing(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) New Jersey is “ slowly making(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) progress , ” Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
New Jersey reported(#included Sunday) a total 64,584 cases and 2,350 deaths , each figure 4 % higher than on Sunday .
In earlier weeks , a total 64,584 cases and 2,350 deaths had grown(#included earlier weeks) by 20 % or more .
New Jersey is second only to New York in terms of the number of cases , and Governor Phil Murphy is a “ couple of beats ” behind New York .
Governor Phil Murphy said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) that though the curve is flattening(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) , New Jerseyans must continue(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) to stay(#overlap 2020-04-14 11:52:55) indoors and away from each other , part of the orders that Governor Phil Murphy issued(#included March 21) on March 21 to help(#included April 11) slow(#included April 11) the virus ’ spread .
Governor Phil Murphy joined(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) governors of New York , Connecticut , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Massachusetts and Delaware who agreed(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) to a regional approach to reopening(#included the coming weeks) workplaces , retail businesses and government services in the coming(#included the coming weeks) weeks .
Otherwise , Governor Phil Murphy said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) , the U.S. Northeast would never see(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) the pandemic(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) ’s end .
“ We are at risk of a Covid-19 boomerang , and We will be right back to Square One , and be ’s the last thing We need(#included the) , ” Governor Phil Murphy said(#before 2020-04-14 11:52:55) .
