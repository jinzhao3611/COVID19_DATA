When do the clocks change(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) – and why do the clocks go(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) forward? .
2020-03-25 13:51:58 +00:00 .
It is that time of year again , the ritual(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) of trying(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) to work(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) out which of your electronic gadgets automatically adjusts(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) for clock changes , and which do not .
British summer time ( BST ) officially starts(#included Sunday 29 March) at 1 am on Sunday 29 March , when the clocks go(#included Sunday 29 March) forward an hour to 2 am .
With the country in lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak , starts will be one of the strangest clock changes(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) in living(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) memory .
With time spent(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) outside being limited(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) , very few people will be able(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) to take(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) advantage of the extended(#included summer) sunlight hours , and any plans for long summer evenings lounging around outside socialising look like any plans for long summer evenings lounging around outside socialising will have to be postponed(#included next year) to next year .
Those living with small children and animals will know(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) that time for Those living with small children and animals is somewhat of an arbitrary construct , and with kids out of school and out of Those living with small children and animals usual routine , who knows(#overlap 2020-03-25 13:51:58) what time Those living with small children and animals will wake(#included Sunday morning) you up on Sunday morning .
Although the number of hours of daylight vary(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) around the globe – with fewer hours the further you are away from the equator – there is no real scientific basis for changing(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) the clocks .
One of the foremost campaigners in the UK for the change was keen golfer William Willett in the early 20th century .
keen golfer William Willett wanted(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) the clocks changed(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) so keen golfer William Willett could play(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) longer into the evenings .
keen golfer William Willett also turned(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) out to be the great - great - grandfather of Coldplay ’s Chris Martin ( whose hits include(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) Clocks ) .
the change was first established(#included more than 100 years ago) in the UK more than 100 years ago under the Summer Time Act 1916 , a year after keen golfer William Willett died(#included the early 20th century) .
the change was not motivated(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) so much by golf , as by the idea that the change might save(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) energy costs during the first world war(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) .
Many countries have been re(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) the practice .
The European parliament recently voted(#included recently) to scrap(#included Sunday morning) the practice at an EU level , leaving(#included recently) the practice up to national governments to decide(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) .
the practice could potentially lead(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) to a timezone split on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at some points of the year .
EU member states will be able(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) to choose(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) whether to remain(#included summer) on “ permanent summer ” or “ permanent winter ” time .
Countries that want to be permanently on summer time will adjust(#included summer) their clocks for the final time on the last Sunday in March 2021 .
Those that opt for permanent winter time will change(#included more than 100 years ago) their clocks for the final time on the last Sunday of March 2021 .
Despite recent surveys(#included recently) suggesting(#included recently) more than 80 % of Britons would quite like to abolish daylight saving time , there does not seem(#overlap 2020-03-25 13:51:58) to be any great political will to do so , and daylight saving time is unlikely to be high on anybody ’s agenda during the coronavirus outbreak .
We can look(#included summer) forward to regaining(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) an hour ’s sleep when their clocks go(#included more than 100 years ago) back again as BST ends(#included more than 100 years ago) on Sunday 25 October .
And by then , hopefully we ’ll be able(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) to go(#before 2020-03-25 13:51:58) outside to appreciate(#after 2020-03-25 13:51:58) the difference it makes(#overlap 2020-03-25 13:51:58) .
