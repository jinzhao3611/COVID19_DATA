By Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton BEIJING , March 31 ( Reuters ) - China has agreed(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) to allow(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) imports of Canadian canola to resume(#after 2020-03-31 13:17:21) , two sources briefed on the matter told(#included Tuesday) Reuters on Tuesday , lifting(#included March 31) a ban in place since March 2019 that had halted $ 2 billion worth of trade .
agreed was reached(#included Tuesday) during a call(#included Tuesday) held(#included Tuesday) by China ’s customs administration and Canada ’s farm ministry on Tuesday , said(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) two sources briefed on the matter .
China ’s General Administration of Customs could not be reached(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) for comment(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) after office hours .
The office of Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie - Claude Bibeau did not immediately respond(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) to a request(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) for comment(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) .
agreed comes(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) as China ’s oilseed processors struggle(#after 2010) with the lowest soybean stocks since at least 2010 , and as the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) disrupts(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) the global supply chain of farm produce .
Canola , like soybeans , is crushed(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) into protein - rich meal for animal feed and Canada is the world ’s top supplier .
China had said(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) a ban in place since March 2019 that had halted $ 2 billion worth of trade was due to quality issues but a ban in place since March 2019 that had halted $ 2 billion worth of trade came(#included last year) amid tense relations with Ottawa , triggered(#included last year) by Canada ’s detention(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) of a top Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive .
The two sides also agreed(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) that the percentage of foreign materials in the canola shipments must be below 1 % , two sources briefed on the matter added(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) .
“ The market is worried(#overlap 2020-03-31 13:17:21) about oilseed supplies .
And there is no energy left for any ( trade(#included PRESENT_REF) ) fights(#included PRESENT_REF) now , ” said(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) another source with a major agriculture products importer .
In 2018 , Canada exported(#included 2018) C$ 2.7 billion ( $ 2.1 billion ) worth of canola seed to China , a market that accounted(#included 2018) for approximately 40 % of all Canadian canola exports .
Canadian canola inventories surged(#included 2019) to an all - time high in March 2019 following(#included 2019) Beijing ’s ban .
Chinese traders engulfed(#included 2018) in on - and - off trade(#included 2018) friction(#included 2018) over the past two years between China and China major grain suppliers were hesitant about resuming(#after 2010) canola imports , however .
“ Even though Chinese traders had(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) a conference call , I am not sure(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) whether the trade channel has really become(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) smooth again .
We will need(#after 2020-03-31 13:17:21) to try(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) and see(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) , ” said(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) another source with an importer in southern China .
A standard on foreign materials had been in place prior to Beijing ’s ban but not strictly implemented(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) in the past , buyers said(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) .
“ If A standard on foreign materials is implemented(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) strictly , it will surely take(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) longer to offload(#after 2020-03-31 13:17:21) the canola cargoes that arrive(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) , ” said(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) a manager with a Chinese crusher that used to crush Canadian rapeseed before the ban .
a manager with a Chinese crusher that used to crush Canadian rapeseed before the ban added(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) that a manager with a Chinese crusher that used to crush Canadian rapeseed before the ban believed(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) it would be hard for shipments to meet(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) A standard on foreign materials unless Canada significantly tightened(#before 2020-03-31 13:17:21) up inspections .
