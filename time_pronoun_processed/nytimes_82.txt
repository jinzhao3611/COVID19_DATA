Curtains for Broadway: No Shows(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) Until Labor Day, at Least .
2020-05-12 15:36:55 +00:00 .
The Broadway League canceled(#included this summer) performances through Sept. 6 and said(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) The Broadway League did not know(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) when performances might resume(#included this summer) .
It ’s official(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) : There will be no Broadway shows(#included this summer) in New York this summer .
The Broadway League said(#included Tuesday) Tuesday that Broadway ’s 41 theaters would remain(#Depend-on 2020-05-12 15:36:55) shuttered(#before Labor Day,) at least through Labor Day .
canceled is not a surprise(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) ; the coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) is continuing(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) to kill(#after 2020-05-12 15:36:55) more than 150 people a day in New York ( down from the peak of 800 ) , and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has put(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) arts and entertainment in the last phase of his reopening plan .
It remains(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) unclear when The Broadway League might reopen(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) .
Many industry officials believe(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) put will be considerably later than Labor Day .
The practical effect of canceled is that box offices and authorized(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) ticket sellers should now refund(#included now) or exchange(#after 2020-05-12 15:36:55) tickets for shows through Sept. 6 .
Industry leaders have been extending(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) shuttered incrementally as a way of managing(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) cash flow , as well as managing(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) expectations(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) .
“ As Broadway ’s been put(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) in phase four of his reopening plan , we felt(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) that Sept. 6 was a reasonable distance of time for refunds(#included Tuesday) and exchanges(#included Sept. 6) , while we fully understand(#included Tuesday) that we may not be back at that time , ” said(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) Charlotte St. Martin , the The Broadway League ’s president .
“ The Broadway League will be back when governor tells(#included this summer) we it ’s safe to be back — Broadway ’s working(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) closely with governor office and with experts to know(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) when that will be . ”
Theaters have been closed(#before Sept. 6) since March 12 , when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo barred(#before Sept. 6) gatherings of more than 500 people .
closed has disappointed(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) legions of fans , cost thousands of people thousands of people jobs and prompted(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) the jettisoning(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) of two productions(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) that were in previews(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) but had not yet opened(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) : the new Martin McDonaghtplay “ Hangmen , ” and a revival(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) of Edward Albee ’s “ Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? ”
The Broadway League is expected(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) to be among the last sectors of the economy to reopen(#after 2020-05-12 15:36:55) because The Broadway League finances depend(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) on assembling(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) large crowds in confined(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) spaces and The Broadway League workplaces , onstage and backstage , place cast and crew in proximity to one another .
The industry has(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) other challenges , too .
In recent years , The industry audiences have included(#included recent years) large numbers of tourists and seniors , two groups that seem(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) likely to return(#included recent years) to Times Square more slowly than others .
And The industry ticket prices are high(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) , which could be a deterrent if the economy stays(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) weak and unemployment remains(#overlap 2020-05-12 15:36:55) high .
In Britain , the Society of London Theater last week announced(#included last week) that shows in the West End have been canceled(#before June 28) until June 28 .
“ canceled does not mean(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) theaters will reopen(#included 29 June) on 29 June , ” canceled said(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) .
“ If further cancellations are necessary further cancellations will continue(#after 2020-05-12 15:36:55) to be announced(#before 2020-05-12 15:36:55) on a rolling basis . ”
