But since a strict nationwide lockdown was imposed(#included March 20) on March 20 to slow(#included March 20) the spread of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) , the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) is having to adapt(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:15:24) .
Don Julio has converted(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) into a high - end butcher shop , with plans to roll(#after 2020-05-12 11:15:24) out street food .
Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the aim was to keep(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) alive the atmosphere and feeling of the corner grill , or ‘ parrilla ’ - a concept that is a key part of Argentine culture and as ubiquitous and emblematic of Buenos Aires as a cafe in Paris or local London pub .
“ We are not going(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) to lose(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) it , so it is a question of finding(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) a way of getting(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) through it , ” Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) .
Argentines have been told(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) to stay(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:15:24) at home , unless Argentines are a key worker or are buying(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) groceries or other essentials .
stay has meant(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) restaurants and cafes have been closed(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) , while small local bakeries , grocers and butchers remain(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:15:24) open .
“ Certainly the idea of ​​the butcher shop is to give(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) people a shade of Don Julio , ” said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio .
Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) people would not do cooked(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) food delivery(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) because it was hard to maintain(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) quality , though people are accelerating(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:15:24) a plan to sell(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) street food .
“ This way we can engage(#after 2020-05-12 11:15:24) people in something that can represent(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) an income until activity restarts(#after 2020-05-12 11:15:24) , ” Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) , adding(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) that Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio 100 employees were still working(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) during the lockdown(#included March 20) in ​​the butcher shop or helping(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) remodel(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the restaurant .
Gaston Riveira , the head of another of the capital city ’s top parrillas , La Cabrera , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the sector was going(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:15:24) through a tough time under a strict nationwide lockdown .
“ We are in a difficult moment because there is no tourism and Argentines are not going(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) out because of the quarantine(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) , ” Gaston Riveira , the head of another of the capital city ’s top parrillas , La Cabrera , told(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) Reuters .
Gaston Riveira , the head of another of the capital city ’s top parrillas , La Cabrera , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the restaurant had “ transformed(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) into a food factory ” doing deliveries on a reduced(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) menu .
Deliveries in aluminum trays and covered(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) pots come(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) with instructions(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) on how to ensure(#overlap 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the food is as close to restaurant quality as the food can be .
“ We try(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) to make(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the food as similar as possible , ” Gaston Riveira , the head of another of the capital city ’s top parrillas , La Cabrera , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) , adding(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) that a lot of the cuts offered(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) come(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) on the bone , which helps(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) maintain(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) the temperature and “ juiciness . ”
The global coronavirus pandemic(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) has hit(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) international demand for Argentine beef more broadly , with many restaurants shuttered(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) from Asia to Europe , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) Mario Ravettino , president of Argentina ’s meat exporters group .

Francisco Palazzo , a 28 - year - old who lives with his girlfriend in Buenos Aires , said(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) it was important for people to be able to get(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) a taste of normality .
Before a strict nationwide lockdown , Francisco Palazzo , a 28 - year - old who lives with his girlfriend in Buenos Aires usually ate(#before 2020-05-12 11:15:24) an ‘ asado ’ mixed grill three times a week .
