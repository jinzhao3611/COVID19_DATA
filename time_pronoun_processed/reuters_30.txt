the U.S. government is expected(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to distribute(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) 60 million payments(#included the) of up to $ 1,200 per individual during the week of April 13 using(#included the) bank deposit information from 2018 and 2019 federal income tax filings , according to a memo from Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee .
the U.S. government will not begin(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to send(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) out paper checks to those who have(#overlap 2020-04-02 20:51:00) no bank deposit information on file until around May 4 , according to a memo from Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee .
The Internal Revenue Service expects(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to issue(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) about 5 million checks per week , meaning(#overlap 2020-04-02 20:51:00) some Americans may wait(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) 20 weeks , a memo from Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee said(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) .
about 5 million checks will be issued(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) in “ reverse adjusted gross income order , ” starting(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) with people with the lowest income .
Under that schedule , about 5 million checks would arrive(#included 2020-09-21) around Sept. 21 , potentially blunting(#included 2020-04-13) the effectiveness of the direct payments , which economists call one of the quickest and most effective ways to stimulate the economy .
An The Internal Revenue Service spokesman did not respond(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to a request(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) for comment(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) .
the direct payments , which economists call one of the quickest and most effective ways to stimulate the economy are authorized(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) by a $ 2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill passed(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) by Congress and signed(#included mid - April) into law by President Donald Trump last week .
People earning(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) up to $ 75,000 a year can expect(#included 2018) payments(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) of up to $ 1,200 , with an additional $ 500 per child .
Those earning(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) more than $ 99,000 are not eligible(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) .
an additional $ 500 per child will flow(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to Americans sooner than under past initiatives .
In 2001 , The Internal Revenue Service needed(#Depend-on 2020-04-02 20:51:00) over six weeks to issue(#included the) rebates authorized(#Depend-on 2020-04-02 20:51:00) by President George W. Bush ’s tax cut(#Depend-on 2020-04-02 20:51:00) .
Seven years later , it took(#included 2001) nearly three months to issue(#included 2001) the first payments to fight(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) the Great Recession .
But the summer - long timeline for checks is too slow to help(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) people beset(#overlap 2020-04-02 20:51:00) by the coronavirus pandemic , analysts said(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) .
“ Not very effective , ” said(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center .
“ I ’ve got(#overlap 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to buy(#included summer) food today .
I ’ve got(#included PRESENT_REF) to pay(#included PRESENT_REF) bills now .
Giving(#included mid - April) I money in mid - September ?
I ’ve take(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) it , but it ’s not helping(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) with I immediate problems . ”
The President Donald Trump administration initially said(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) people who do not file(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) tax returns would have to fill(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) out a simplified(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) form to get(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) a payment .
Under pressure from Democrats who said(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) senior citizens and others would be penalized(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) , the Treasury Department later announced(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) that Social Security beneficiaries would not have to complete(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) additional paperwork .
Others who do not file(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) tax returns still need(#overlap 2020-04-02 20:51:00) to file a simplified(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) form to get(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) the money .
The Internal Revenue Service expects(#included late) to create(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) an online portal by late April or early May through which taxpayers can learn(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) the status of taxpayers payment(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) and update(#after 2020-04-02 20:51:00) direct deposit information , a memo from Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee said(#before 2020-04-02 20:51:00) .
The Internal Revenue Service is also looking(#overlap 2020-04-02 20:51:00) for information on about 90 million to 110 million taxpayers who are either filers or non - filers , a memo from Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee said(#included 2020-04-05) .
