Nick Oxford China started(#included March) processing in March applications from its companies to waive(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) import tariffs on U.S. energy goods as part of the Sino - U.S. Phase 1 trade(#included March) deal and its companies have since bought(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) liquefied(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) natural gas ( LNG ) and liquefied(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) petroleum gas ( LPG ) from the United States .
Nick Oxford China is boosting(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) U.S. energy imports at a time when the world is swamped(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) with excess supply after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and Russia failed(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to extend(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) production(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) cuts(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) and as measures(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to curb(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) the spread of the coronavirus undermined demand .
Cheap U.S. energy supplies will help(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) China lower(#after 2020-04-01 09:22:57) China import costs , but the deep discounts(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) will add(#after 2020-04-01 09:22:57) further pressure on U.S. producers to shut(#after 2002) in production(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) after U.S. crude futures CLc1 slumped(#after 2002) to U.S. crude futures CLc1 lowest since 2002 .
U.S. Mars Sour crude has been sold(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to Chinese buyers at discounts between $ 7 and $ 9 a barrel to September ICE Brent futures for July arrival while the discounts for West Texas Intermediate crude ( WTI ) in Midland , Texas were between $ 6 and $ 7 a barrel , six trade sources told Reuters .
BP ( BP.L ) and Equinor ( EQNR.OL ) may have sold(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) some of these cargoes , six trade sources said(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) , while the buyers were not immediately known .
BP ( BP.L ) declined(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to comment(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) while Equinor ( EQNR.OL ) could not be immediately reached(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) for comment(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) outside office hours .
“ Only the Chinese are buying(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) and the rest of the world are selling(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) , ” a Singapore - based trader said(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) , leading(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to some “ very aggressive offers(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) ” for U.S. crude into that market even though the oil ’s benchmark is already at the lowest in 18 years .
In early March , independent refinery Panjin Haoye Chemical Co bought(#included early March) Mars crude from PetroChina in one of the first signs of Chinese refiners resuming(#included early March) U.S. crude purchases(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) .
Mars and WTI were then offered(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) at spot premiums to benchmarks .
U.S. crude is mired(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) in deep discount as producers , forced(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to clear(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) pipelines stuck(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) with unsold oil , are now flooding(#included PRESENT_REF) the U.S. gulf coast with cheap crude .
Strong demand to ship(#Depend-on 2020-04-01 09:22:57) out excess U.S. crude to China has also caused(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) freight rates to surge(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) , with costs jumping(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to $ 8-$10 per barrel , two of six trade sources said(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) .

Chinese refiners are gradually ramping(#included February) up output after sharp cuts(#included February) in February although Chinese refiners have yet to return(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) to levels before the outbreak(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) as demand recovery is still slow , six trade sources said(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) .
“ Demand is bad globally .
China seems(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) relatively OK , ” said(#before 2020-04-01 09:22:57) a source at a Shandong - based refinery .
“ China are steadily increasing(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) operation(#overlap 2020-04-01 09:22:57) rates . ”
