2020-05-25 15:02:27 +00:00 .
For some lobster fishermen in Val Comeau , in northeastern New Brunswick , the loss(#included 2020-04-02) of the processing plant in a fire Thursday was just the latest blow(#included 2020-04-02) in an already stressful lobster fishing season .
Steve Ferguson said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) Steve Ferguson wonders(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) what will happen(#included this week) next as some lobster fishermen in Val Comeau , in northeastern New Brunswick , wait(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to see(#included Today) if the buyer they deal with at Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous factory will be able to help(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the buyer they deal with at Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous factory out .
" Today and tomorrow , some lobster fishermen in Val Comeau , in northeastern New Brunswick , do n't even know(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) if some lobster fishermen in Val Comeau , in northeastern New Brunswick , have(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) buyers to buy(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) some lobster fishermen in Val Comeau , in northeastern New Brunswick , catch . "
While a large part of the processing plant was destroyed(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) in a fire , a portion of the processing plant not damaged(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) is set(#included this week) to resume(#included this week) processing(#included this week) lobster this week with about a third of the staff .
Val Comeau said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) 331 people were working(#included 2020-04-02) at the processing plant at the time of a fire , and 100 lobster fishermen sold(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) 100 lobster fishermen catch to the processing plant .
Local fishermen want(#Depend-on 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to make(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) sure Local fishermen catch will take(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) priority over lobster being brought(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) in from Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island .
" At the end of the day , if Local fishermen ca n't produce(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) our lobster from here , why are Local fishermen bringing(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) so much from other provinces .
our want(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) Local fishermen to buy(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) local first before buying(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) from somewhere else . "
Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous has moved(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) some employees to other plants , but Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous is still evaluating(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the impact(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) of a fire and considering(#included Today) the next steps .
" Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous are exploring(#included Today) every option to address(#included Today) the current situation for Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous workers and the local fishermen , " Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous said(#included 2020-04-02) in a statement .
Trying(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to find(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) a buyer and a plant to process(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) their lobster has been stressful(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) for about two - thirds of the fleet that fish from the wharf in Val Comeau and some that fish from Tracadie - Sheila since a fire .
Fishermen were trying(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to meet(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) with the buyer they deal with at Les Pêcheries de Chez - Nous factory to see(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) if something could be worked(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) out .
But it 's not all Fishermen 've been dealing(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) with said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) Steve Ferguson .
First , COVID-19 delayed(#included spring) the opening of the spring lobster season in Zone 23 by two weeks from COVID-19 start date of May 1 to May 15 .
Then Premier Blaine Higgs said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the temporary foreign workers on their way to work in fish processing plants and on farms across the province were banned(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) from entering(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the province .
Processing plants scrambled(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to find(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) enough staff to help(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) process(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) their lobster .
But two days into the spring lobster season , some buyers set(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) a quota and limited(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the amount of lobster some buyers would buy(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) .
But with high catches , Steve Ferguson said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) , having(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) a 500 - pound quota is hurting(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the bottom line , especially with the low price some buyers are expecting(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to be paid(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) .
" Anything under five bucks is not a good price .
" Even trying(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to sell(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the remainder of the catch left(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) after a 500 - pound quota is proving(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) difficult with so many others trying(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to do the same thing .
Steve Ferguson said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) Steve Ferguson wishes(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the spring lobster season would have been cancelled(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) altogether as things like this continue(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to happen(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) .
" It 's not just Val Comeau wharf , It 's all along the Acadian Peninsula , up north , we have(#overlap 2020-05-25 15:02:27) all the same issue with every wharf . "
Keith Chaisson , the MLA for Tracadie - Sheila joined(#included Sunday morning) the fishermen at the processing plant Sunday morning to listen(#included Sunday morning) to their concerns .
" Every day the fishermen do n't go(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) out fishing is another day the fishermen do n't get(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) any money . "
Describing(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) the situation the fishermen are in as a " perfect storm , " Premier Blaine Higgs said(#before 2020-05-25 15:02:27) Premier Blaine Higgs was going(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) to take(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) their concerns to the minister of agriculture , aquaculture and fisheries to see(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) if anything can be done to help(#after 2020-05-25 15:02:27) .
