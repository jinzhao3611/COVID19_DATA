{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2431323, "name": "Brett Martel"}, "body": "Mr. Dempsey’s game-winning field goal against Detroit on Nov. 8, 1970, stood as an NFL record for 43 years until the Broncos’ Matt Prater broke it with a 64-yarder in Denver in 2013.\n\nMr. Dempsey spent 11 years in the NFL. His first two seasons were with New Orleans (1969-70), the next four with Philadelphia, then two with the Los Angeles Rams, one with the Houston Oilers and the final two with Buffalo. He retired after the 1979 season.\n\nMr. Dempsey was born in Milwaukee without four fingers on his right hand and without toes on his right foot. He kicked straight on with a flat-front shoe that drew protests from some who saw the specially made kicking shoe as an unfair advantage. Former Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm compared the shoe to “the head of a golf club.”\n\nBut Mr. Dempsey would counter that by saying he was merely doing the best he could to use the foot with which he was born. For the most part, NFL officials — including then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle — agreed.\n\nStill, in 1977, the NFL passed what is widely known as the Dempsey Rule, mandating that shoes worn by players with “an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.”\n\nMr. Dempsey returned to New Orleans after retiring from the league. His kick has remained part of Saints lore, standing as one of the greatest moments in the history of a franchise that didn’t make the playoffs until 1987, its 21st season, and didn’t win a playoff game until the 2000 season.\n\nAt the time of the kick, the Superdome had yet to be built, and the Saints played home games in the old Tulane Stadium, which was demolished in 1979.\n\nThe Lions led 17-16 after a short field goal with 11 seconds left.\n\nWith no timeouts, the Saints managed to move the ball to their own 45 with 2 seconds left after Billy Kilmer completed a pass to Al Dodd along the sideline.\n\nAccording to media reports, special teams coach Don Heinrich was heard barking, “Tell Stumpy to get ready to go in and kick a long one.”\n\nAt that time, goal posts were on the goal line, not behind the end zone. The spot of the kick was the Saints 37.\n\n“I was more concerned about kicking it straight because I felt I could handle the distance,” Mr. Dempsey told the Times-Picayune newspaper. “I knew I was going to get a perfect snap from Jackie Burkett and a perfect hold from Joe Scarpati. It was all up to me. I hit it sweet.”\n\nKilmer told the Times-Picayune he remembers standing on the sideline seeing Lions players across the field laughing as Mr. Dempsey lined up for the momentous kick.\n\n“They thought Tom had no chance,” Kilmer said.\n\nBut Mr. Dempsey ended up carried off the field on the shoulders of teammates and recalled spending all night celebrating at a Bourbon Street bar.\n\n“We were there, with all the guys, until the wee hours,” he said. “From what I can recall, I had a great time.”\n\nBoth the shoe with which Mr. Dempsey kicked the 63-yarder and the ball are in the Saints Hall of Fame in New Orleans, into which Mr. Dempsey was inducted in 1989. The Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, has another of Mr. Dempsey’s specially made kicking shoes, but Mr. Dempsey wanted the mementos of the record-breaking kick to remain in New Orleans.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Carlene; three children; a sister; and a number of grandchildren.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2430257, "name": "Mckenna Oxenden"}, "body": "“I’m used to rats, not bison,” Broxton said.\n\nThe 27-year-old TV reporter had been assigned to go to Yellowstone National Park to interview the park superintendent after the protected area had been ordered closed on March 24 to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nSince starting at the Montana TV station almost two years ago, Broxton said he’s been sent to Yellowstone at least 25 times and almost always sees bison. But they’ve never gotten close, let alone made direct eye contact with him.\n\n“They always say, ‘Stay at least 25 yards away from mammals,’” Broxton said in an interview with The Baltimore Sun. “But that damn bison broke the 25-yard barrier and I was like, ‘Uhhh, I’m not dealing with this!’”\n\nIn an 18-second video Broxton tweeted, he’s standing near the park sign trying to record a video to “tease” his story for the evening newscast when his eyes dart off camera.\n\n“Oh, my god. Oh, my god,” he says in the video.\n\nHis eyes dart whizz back to the camera, signaling that, for a second, he’s debating about starting the recording over again. Broxton quickly decides against it.\n\n“Oh, no, I ain’t messing with you,” he says. “Oh, no. Oh, no.”\n\nThere was a group of seven bison grazing in the area, Broxton said, when all of a sudden one looked up at him and wouldn’t stop staring. Then, the bison stared him down and started to trot toward him.\n\nBroxton was hoping the animal might stop and go back to eating grass, but he didn’t want to risk anything. So, he threw the tripod and camera into his car as quickly as he could.\n\n“I don’t know if he was actually going to come at me, but I knew I didn’t want to stick around to find out,” he said. “I wasn’t trying to be on CNN for being killed by a bison.”\n\nEventually, Broxton said, he was able to safely record himself by backing his car in the opposite direction of the trotting bison.\n\nBefore moving to Montana to work as a general assignment reporter, Broxton grew up in Baltimore City’s Oliver neighborhood and graduated from Archbishop Curley High School. After studying journalism at Towson University, Broxton worked at Channel 13 CBS-WJZ as a web producer for almost two years.\n\nBroxton said that although he is learning to enjoy the outdoors and embrace life outside the city, he still has an affinity for his hometown.\n\n“I will rep Baltimore until the day I die,” he said. “I still have my Maryland license plate and ID, and I’ll never get rid of it.”\n\nBroxton said he never expected the video to become such a sensation. By 11:45 p.m. on March 25, it had 4.2 million views and almost 195,000 favorites on Twitter.\n\nBut the reporter said he is happy he can put a smile on people’s faces, especially given the increased stress of the coronavirus. One person told him seeing the video made them smile for the first time in days.\n\n“I’ve posted funny videos before, but never gotten a response like this,” Broxton said. “When you’re out in the field sometimes you just get some gems.”\n\nAlmost a week after the viral video, the park service tweeted a new “commemorative” safety poster in honor of Broxton. The poster features a bison and one of the phrases Broxton said in the video: “Oh no, not messing with you.”\n\nFor copyright information, check with the distributor of this item, The Baltimore Sun.",

Last season, Guy was selected the most outstanding player in the Final Four after the Cavaliers won the first national championship in program history.\n\nThen a junior, Guy sparked the top-seeded Cavaliers (35-3) with 24 points in the national championship game, an 85-77 overtime win against No. 3 seed Texas Tech in Minneapolis. He made 8 of 15 field goal attempts, including 4 of 9 from three-point range, and added three rebounds and a steal.\n\nIn the national semifinals against No. 5 seed Auburn, Guy scored 15 points, none more important than three free throws with sixth-tenths of a second remaining, and Virginia rallied for a 63-62 win. He also made a three-pointer with 7.4 seconds to play that cut Virginiaâ€™s deficit to one point.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Guy announced on social media he was declaring for the NBA draft, where the Sacramento Kings selected him in the second round with the 55th overall pick.\n\nâ€œWhen I was 7 or 8 my grandpa had me sign a piece of paper saying heâ€™d be my manager (jokingly) if I ever made it to the NBA,â€� Guy wrote Saturday in an Instagram post. â€œSomething as small as that was always on my mind while I tried to make that dream come true. I know heâ€™s up there waiting for his cut â€¦ and one day, Iâ€™ll give it to him.â€�\n\nGuy played in two January games before the NBA suspended its season March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn his Instragram post, Guy said of the pandemic: â€œI urge and beg you all to take this seriously.â€� As of Saturday evening, there have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases and 8,000 deaths from the coronavirus in the United States.\n\nGuy was one of three players on the Cavaliers last season to leave early, joining point guard Ty Jerome and swingman Deâ€™Andre Hunter, who was the fourth overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-26", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB17-26",

All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]\n The ship appeared to be following the playbook of Zaandam and Rotterdam, two Holland America Line ships that arrived in Port Everglades on Thursday after four passengers on Zaandam died. Princess said guests who are deemed “fit to fly” are expected to start disembarking Sunday and will transfer straight to Miami International Airport to catch flights home.\n Anyone with respiratory symptoms who is not too sick to need hospitalization on land — or who is recovering from being sick previously — will stay on the ship until they are cleared by doctors on board.\n The ship is carrying 1,898 people, including 1,020 guests.\n Coral Princess left San Antonio, Chile on March 5. A week later, Princess Cruises announced it was suspending operations, a move the rest of the industry followed. But only some passengers were able to disembark on March 19 in Buenos Aires, and ports in Uruguay and Brazil denied requests to let passengers off.\n Everyone had free run of the ship until Tuesday, when the operator said a “higher-than-normal number” of people reported flu-like symptoms and ordered passengers to stay in their rooms.\n Read more:\n Fort Lauderdale-bound Coral Princess confirms 12

In the week tracked by Friday’s jobs numbers, the week ending March 14, there were 282,000 claims. The following week? It was 3.3 million. By last week, it was at 6.6 million. (These numbers are adjusted for seasonal variation, so that we can make historical comparisons).\n\nJobless claims are the only government data that comes close to keeping pace with the speed of the crisis. The unemployment-insurance system is at the heart of the government’s response to the pandemic, so it’s fitting that it’s also the leading edge of its data.\n\nBut, like the system itself, the data has been flooded beyond recognition. It no longer makes sense to look at it in the context of previous unemployment-claims filings. We need to bring in other labor market numbers. In the chart below, we compare it with a few touchstones.\n\nGreater than the Great Recession\n\nFrom January 2008 to February 2010, the economy lost 8,705,000 jobs. The losses in that two-year period, among the most dismal in U.S. history, were likely eclipsed in the two weeks at the end of March.\n\nGreater than the Trump boom\n\nFrom November 2016 to February 2020, the economy added about 7,275,000 jobs. It’s a job-creation record that Trump highlighted early and often, despite it being at roughly the same pace as his predecessor’s second term. Unemployment claims numbers indicate job creation is likely already in negative territory.\n\nGreater than New York \n\nBut it’s hard to grasp abstract milestones like those above, so we also compared the late-March losses to local labor markets.\n\nIf laid-off Americans were their own state right now, they’d be the third-largest, behind California (17.61 million) and Texas (13.02 million) and right ahead of New York (9.85 million). They outnumber workers in the sixteen least-populated states combined.\n\nYes, but\n\nUnemployment claims at this level are an enormous strain on the system and an unprecedented disruption for millions of U.S. businesses and households, but it’s also the system working as intended.\n\nThe new stimulus package signed into law last week, the CARES Act, made more people eligible for unemployment insurance and dramatically ramped up benefits to help workers and businesses survive a prolonged period of distancing. The goal of the bailout should be to keep as many workers whole as possible for as long as they’re home and stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, as University of Massachusetts at Amherst economist Arindrajit Dube  points out on Twitter.\n\nIn normal times, an elevated unemployment claims number could be an early sign of trouble. This time, an excruciatingly high number means the system is beginning to help millions of people. But it nevertheless means pain and disruption for millions of Americans and their employers.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB4-9", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1032903, "name": "Dana Hedgpeth"}, "body": "The U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday suspended trials and grand juries until June 11 and closed public access to the clerk of the court’s office, broadening and extending by one month a previously announced partial shutdown in response to the coronavirus emergency.\n\nThe move comes as federal district courts in neighboring Maryland and eastern Virginia implemented contingency plans, closing courthouses in Greenbelt, Md., and Newport News, Va., respectively, to serve as emergency courthouses as needed if other federal courthouses in the states become unusable. That is not an option for the U.S. District Court in Washington, which operates out of one facility, the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, that is also home to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the national security-focused Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nNeither of the latter two courts announced changes Thursday. However, in a seven-page order, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District cited stay-at-home orders issued Monday by the mayor of the District and governors of Maryland and Virginia and related closures of nonessential businesses, “reflecting the seriousness of the need to combat the community spread of the virus.” Maryland and D.C. officials did not give an end date for their measures, while Virginia's remains in effect until June 10 or until further order.\n\nThe federal court in Washington earlier limited access to the courthouse only to judges, staff members and people with official business. As initially ordered March 17, limited operations in criminal, civil and bankruptcy matters will continue to ensure the public’s safety, including newly arrested criminal defendants’ initial appearances and detention hearings, which will proceed by video conference when feasible.\n\nIn a new restriction, however, the district court cut off public access to the clerk of the court's intake counters and computer terminals, and permitted emergency and sealed filings to be made by email instead of in-person. No reason for the change was stated.\n\nSeparately Thursday, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark S. Davis of the eastern district of Virginia announced the closure of one of the district’s four courthouses, in Newport News, and its designation as the “Emergency Judicial Center.” Davis said in an order that the courthouse “will be sanitized and preserved for safe use, in order to serve as a ‘last resort’ location for Court proceedings” if the district’s three other courthouses in Alexandria, Norfolk and Richmond are “rendered unusable.” \n\nChief U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar of Maryland on March 18 closed that state’s federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Md., while consolidating proceedings at its Baltimore courthouse, in part to reduce the number of staff needed and to improve the focus and efficiency of health screening. In an order, Bredar stated that the Greenbelt facility would remain sufficiently staffed “to retain the capacity to hear emergency proceedings at short notice when unique circumstances make that necessary and appropriate.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-2", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1054167, "name": "Lisa Rein"}, "body": "The speed with which the money is disbursed will depend largely on people’s method of filing taxes. Electronic payments can be distributed quickly, whereas the IRS must print paper checks and mail them separately. About eight in 10 taxpayers have signed up for direct deposit payments for their past tax refunds, a number that has grown in recent years. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that these Americans would receive the money within two weeks.\n\nAn IRS spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe IRS plan would distribute paper checks to the lowest-income Americans first, prioritizing payments for individual taxpayers with incomes of $10,000 or less on April 24.\n\nChecks for earners of $20,000 or less would be in the mail May 1, followed by those with incomes of $30,000 on May 8, $40,000 on May 15, and continuing in income increments of $10,000 each week, according to the plan. The IRS plans to issue about 5 million checks each week.\n\nStimulus checks would be issued on Sept. 4 to joint taxpayers earning around $200,000, the maximum allowed under the stimulus. All others would be sent on Sept. 11, in most cases because the IRS did not have prior tax information for them and they need to apply for the checks.\n\nThe tax agency is racing to set up payment systems as millions of Americans have been forced out of the labor force by the pandemic, with jobless claims soaring to a staggering 6.6 million last week.\n\nThe plan is to generate electronic checks on April 9, according to the payment schedule  reviewed by The Washington Post. Depending on how quickly banks process the payments, they would be deposited by April 14 at the latest.\n\n“If we know where to put the money, we’re going to press the button and put it there next week,” said an IRS official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAmerican adults who earned less than $75,000 will receive a $1,200 payment, with children receiving $500. The payment will be phased out for Americans who receive more than that, and adults that earned more than $99,000 will not receive the benefit, under the law.\n\nAbout 145 million Americans are eligible for stimulus checks, depending on their income.   Mnuchin had said he expected most Americans to get their payments by April 17. The IRS still has not said publicly how long it would take the agency to issue paper checks, or how it plans to decide who should get them first.\n\nAnother 64 million Americans receiving Social Security and disability income will also receive checks, many of them electronically, after the Treasury Department announced  Wednesday that they can get payments even if they typically do not file a tax return.\n\nMost  taxpayers will not have to file a separate claim with the IRS to receive their checks. The new law directs the Treasury to look at Americans’ 2019 or 2018 tax returns to determine if they are eligible for a payment.\n\nThe agency had strongly considered spacing payments out based on $25,000 income brackets, but concluded in recent days that it needed to send the checks in smaller batches because its networks do not have the  bandwidth to issue so many checks in one week, the IRS official said. A slower ramp seemed more manageable, the official said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Now we have an identification-card mentality. It’s not quite as free.”\n\nAfter one defendant complained that prison guards had not given him prayer beads and rugs, Duffy replied: “You’re a convicted felon. ... You’re not some guy on vacation.”\n\n“You talk about the Koran,” he told another defendant. “You have shamed it. ... You violated the laws not only of man, but God.”\n\nAt a sentencing years later, he called Yousef, the 1993 bombing’s mastermind, an “apostle of evil.’’\n\nBesides the terror trials, Duffy had other high-profile proceedings, including the trial of Paul Castellano, who allegedly headed the Gambino organized crime family before he was assassinated outside a Manhattan steak house after the trial had started.\n\nHe also presided over a 1983 trial resulting from the 1981 armed robbery of a Brinks truck in Rockland County that led to a shootout between Black Liberation Army members and the police. A guard and two Nyack officers were killed in the robbery. The trial ended with several convictions.\n\nDuffy was at times bombastic.\n\nIt took an appeals court only weeks after the trade center bombing to reverse as a violation of free speech a gag order barring all prosecutors, investigators, defense attorneys and others from discussing the case. Duffy had threatened to impose fines that would start at $200 for a first offense and increase exponentially to $1.6 billion by a third offense.\n\nYet, he used a folksy demeanor with jurors, making them feel at ease with plain talk.\n\nAfter a jury was chosen for the 1993 trade center trial and opening arguments were about to begin, he offered them the chance to quit the jury for no reason at all if they didn’t want to be there. No one quit.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Branford toured with Sting, led the Tonight Show band and is one of the leading saxophonists of his generation.\n\nTwo of Mr. Marsalis’s other sons, trombonist Delfeayo and drummer Jason Marsalis, also became musicians, and jazz fans flocked to hear the family on the rare occasions when they performed together, whether in New Orleans or on nationwide tours.\n\nExcept for a period in the 1980s, when he taught at Virginia Commonwealth University, Mr. Marsalis spent virtually all his life in New Orleans. He was in the band of popular trumpeter Al Hirt, but he did not compromise his musical standards, even when he was barely scraping by, raising six sons while pursuing his art in obscurity.\n\nHe found a measure stability in his 40s, when he taught at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, a high school whose students included trumpeters Terence Blanchard and Nicholas Payton and singer-pianist Harry Connick Jr.\n\nMr. Marsalis taught at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond in the 1980s before returning to his hometown to lead the jazz studies program  studies program at the University of New Orleans. His sons said he never pushed them into music, but his dedication to his art, and his deep-seated knowledge of New Orleans’s musical traditions, had an inescapble influence on their lives.\n\n“My father’s contribution to my career is of no importance,” Branford Marsalis told the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2001. “My father’s contribution to my life is that he taught me by example to question the accepted norms of society. He taught me to embrace new adventures rather than shy away from them. He taught me the vast difference between knowing what you like and liking what you know. These things have led me to be the person that I am, which subsequently makes me the musician I am.”\n\nMr. Marsalis and his four sons were named National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters in 2011, and he continued to perform regularly at the Snug Harbor jazz club in New Orleans until this year.\n\nHis wife of 59 years, the former Dolores Ferdinand, died in 2017.\n\nThis is a developing story.

His health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday, he went back to St. Francis by ambulance. He was admitted and tested positive for the virus.\n\nAlice Matthews and other family members were not allowed to visit him in the hospital. She talked to him twice before he died.\n\n“I haven’t seen him since Friday,” she said. “They would just call me and give me updates. They really are not letting anyone in, no matter what.”\n\nNow she is grieving in physical isolation, given her likely exposure to the virus.\n\n“I wanted to go down there and see her, but if I did that, then my 15 days [of isolation] start,” said their son, Jammal Matthews, 38, who lives in Prince William County. “My mom’s tough, she’s very tough. But, obviously, this hurts. . . . I’m checking on her, making sure she’s eating. I call her every three hours. I know she hates being in the house.”\n\nSterling Matthews, who would have turned 61 on April 13, grew up in Richmond, the son of a Philip Morris factory worker and a hairdresser, both of whom survive him. He met his future wife at Armstrong High School, then located in the city’s Church Hill neighborhood.\n\n“I liked everything about him,” Alice Matthews said. “He was just kind and not one of these guys that you think you can date, and you can try and go figure out, is he playing you? If you was his girl, you was his girl. He didn’t stray away from that. He treated me like a queen.”\n\nThey would have celebrated their 40th anniversary in June.\n\nA veteran of both the U.S. Air Force and Army, Sterling Matthews was working in support services at Fort Belvoir, an Army installation in Fairfax County, when he became ill. He was relatively  healthy, after beating prostate cancer a few years ago, his son said. His wife fiercely monitored his blood sugar to control his diabetes.\n\n“She was a tiger lady on that,” Jammal Matthews said. “He never had a complication from his diabetic status.”\n\nSterling Matthews and his wife, an administrative assistant for the Virginia Department of Education, had been looking forward to retiring in two years. Their plan, Alice said, was to “be with our grandbabies.”\n\nJammal and his wife have a daughter, Devyn, 3. Michell Lyons, the cousin his parents raised as their daughter, has two children, Aaliyah, 12, and Caleb, 7.\n\nMatthews was a deacon at Moore Street Missionary Baptist Church, assistant superintendent of its Sunday school program and a Sunday school teacher. He also mentored at-risk boys through the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, which included taking the boys to etiquette classes to prepare them for the fraternity’s annual scholarship ball.\n\n“They would teach them where to put the napkins, which fork to use, which glass to use, stuff like that,” his wife said. “He thought it was important for . . .  the young boys to become men.”\n\nJammal Matthews said his father always gave “100 percent” to anyone who needed his help.\n\n“He took an interest in people, and he always used to say, ‘You just can’t throw people away,’ ” the son said. “He always thought there was something redeeming about the human spirit and that encouragement in a positive way would bring out the best in people.”\n\nJulie Tate contributed to this report.", "categories":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2409318, "name": "David J"}, "body": "For Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the novel coronavirus outbreak has emerged at an opportune time. After many false starts and embarrassing court defeats, the administration has moved on from its efforts to put off regulatory deadlines or not enforce existing rules. Now, agencies are racing to roll back environmental standards and privatize public lands before the election-year clock runs out. Their strategy is to plow forward regardless of the public health threat, working at a breakneck pace, undistracted by careful scientific deliberation or feedback from the public, which has been largely sidelined by the virus.\n\nThe coronavirus emergency exposes this cynical strategy. While using the virus as an excuse to scale back their already-light pollution enforcement activities, the EPA and the Interior Department insist on pushing forward their special interest agenda. They are doing so with the White House’s cooperation, even as courts, businesses, and other federal, state and local agencies push back nonessential deadlines.\n\nOn March 18, as social distancing measures were implemented across the country, the EPA released a proposal that would give agency scientists license to discount or ignore well-designed, peer-reviewed human health studies. These studies provide the basis for many of our most important air pollution limits, requirements for toxic protection and cleanup, and standards for drinking water. No public hearing on the proposal has been scheduled (nor could it be amid the covid-19 threat). The EPA set a short, 30-day comment period — with no public hearing — that will preclude meaningful input from many in the scientific community. A particularly notable absence would be feedback from the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering, who criticized an earlier, more narrow version of this proposal, and who are almost certainly consumed by our national health emergency.\n\nMeanwhile, the Interior Department refused to extend a March 19 comment deadline on a rule favored by the oil and gas industry that lifts migratory bird protections under a 100-year-old law, insulating companies from liability for reckless practices that they know would needlessly kill birds. Also in March, ignoring the global collapse in oil prices amid the coronavirus outbreak, the Interior Department held five poorly subscribed oil and gas sales in four Western states and the Gulf of Mexico. Concerned citizens had only 10 days to file protests before leases are consummated under draconian procedures that largely shut out public review and input. Already, one federal court has ruled illegal these constraints on public participation in connection with earlier oil and gas sales that were contested.\n\nThe anti-environment efforts continue on other fronts. The administration is shelving auto mileage improvements and preparing to terminate obligations for oil and gas companies to control methane emissions — outcomes that are bad for the climate, asthma sufferers and other consumers. Also lurking is the Interior Department’s opening of the iconic Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a boneheaded move in any era but particularly now, when the agency cannot meet Congress’s prerequisites for opening the refuge — and when privatizing priceless public-owned lands for oil and gas development makes zero moral or economic sense.\n\nStanding alone, the administration’s anti-environment, anti-conservation and anti-science agenda is an outrage. Continuing to aggressively prosecute the agenda when our country is consumed by a major health emergency is inexcusable.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-2", "level": 2, "links":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1718595, "name": "Tara Lachapelle"}, "body": "Kilar, 48, is replacing John Stankey, the longtime ATT executive who has been juggling two titles: head of WarnerMedia and chief operating officer of the Dallas-based wireless parent company. Killar will report to Stankey, who began his career at one of the Baby Bells and is now considered a top candidate to become ATT’s next CEO  when Randall Stephenson retires. The leadership of the new ATT is taking shape, though the WarnerMedia gig wasn’t necessarily an easy sell for industry veterans watching the messy integration from afar.\n\nKilar is an interesting choice. Nine years ago, he infamously wrote a memo that read like an obituary for traditional TV, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst for LightShed Partners, who found a digital copy. “History has shown that incumbents tend to fight trends that challenge established ways and, in the process, lose focus on” customers, Kilar wrote, needling Hulu’s partners at the time (it’s now  controlled by Walt Disney Co.). That means HBO, after being led for two years by a wireless executive who knew little about traditional media, will now be led by someone who cares nothing for it. After the Jerry Maguire-like manifesto, one news headline asked if Kilar was trying to get fired; now that kind of thinking has gotten him the top job at a Hollywood giant.\n\nFollowing his time at Hulu, Kilar went on to create a $3-a-month subscription-video service  called Vessel. He sold it in 2016 to Verizon Communications Inc., which shut doMn the service days later and put the Vessel team to work on its own go90 mobile-video product. It was part of Verizon’s failed expansion into media, with go90 now also long gone. \n\nKilar’s arrival marks another step on ATT’s stormy path to become an entertainment juggernaut that can compete with Disney and Netflix Inc. That journey began when ATT acquired Time Warner in June 2018, after initially facing government resistance and later, skepticism from ATT’s own shareholders that the megamerger would work. (The company’s last major deal, for the DirecTV satellite service, was already creating  enough headaches.) Since then, Stankey has reshuffled the Warner ranks, occasionally creating controversy among employees who weren’t on board with the changes. He told me in an interview last year that he was working to have Warner’s sub-brands work closer together toward a common mission of making HBO Max a success.\n\nWith most everyone stuck home because of the coronavirus pandemic and binge-watching TV, some have wondered why Stankey hasn’t pushed up the release of HBO Max. Doing so might help it capture more subscribers faster. Although, more time spent watching doesn’t necessarily translate into more money for streaming services, since viewers pay a monthly rate to access an all-you-can-stream buffet of content. The CEO transition may be yet another reason that WarnerMedia is being patient. There’s also tremendous pressure on ATT to prove it can get this right, not least because it’s saddled with about $180 billion of debt as the U.S. economy hurtles toward a recession.\n\nLast fall, I wrote  a piece asking, “Is ATT’s Hollywood plot too far-fetched?” In the coming months, Kilar will help provide the answer. \n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

The dispute led to the suspension of European Union-mediated talks to normalize ties between Pristina and Belgrade.\n\nMost Serb goods stopped arriving in Kosovo after the import taxes were introduced, except for products that were mainly smuggled into Kosovo’s Serb-dominated Mitrovica.\n\nAnnual trade between Serbia and Kosovo was valued at about 400 million euros ($440 million) before the tariffs were adopted, and inflation in Kosovo rose to about 3% in 2019 after the import taxes took effect compared to 1.1% the previous year.\n\nKosovo was formerly a part of Serbia and won independence after a 1999 NATO bombing campaign that ended a bloody Serb crackdown on an armed uprising by members of Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority. Serbia refuses to accept Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence.\n\nSince the start of the Pristina-Belgrade talks in 2011, 33 deals have been signed to ensure the country’s recognition each other in areas such as education and professional degrees.\n\nKosovo claims Serbia has not fulfilled its side of the agreements. Kosovo recognizes diplomas from Serbian universities, but Serbia does not accept the degrees of Kosovar university graduates. It’s the same with drivers’ licenses.\n\nKurti said the government would monitor whether Serbia moves toward reciprocity until June 15 and if not, the tariffs will be restored.\n\nThe junior partner in Kurti’s coalition government, the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, initiated a successful parliamentary vote of no-confidence vote in his Cabinet last week. His government now is acting in a caretaker capacity.\n\nThe motion came after an LDK minister was fired for not supporting the restrictions on movement the government imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe LDK also wanted Kurti to fully revoke the 100% tariff and not damage ties with the Kosovo’s most important ally, the United States.\n\nThe United States argued that Kurti’s actions would strangle Kosovo’s economy.\n\n“We remain opposed to the latest move to implement reciprocal measures on the movement of goods from Serbia.” the U.S.Embassy in Kosovo said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nJosep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, hailed Kosovo’s move as “an important decision.”\n\nAssociated Press witers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec contributed from Belgrade.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

At the time Republicans argued that it was too large and not focused enough on creating jobs.\n\nIn his new ad, McConnell says the $2.2 trillion bill provides “urgent help” for families, small businesses and “our health care heroes” and specifically mentions a provision extending unemployment benefits.\n\nThe legislation, which passed the Senate after intense negotiations between the White House and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), aims to deliver a tidal wave of cash to individual Americans, businesses and health-care facilities all reeling from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nJust two weeks ago, McConnell lashed out at one of his Democratic opponents in Kentucky, Amy McGrath, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and combat pilot, for airing ads critical of him during the crisis. In a statement, McConnell’s campaign manager called McGrath’s decision to continue airing ads “tasteless and shameful,” adding that “the last thing [Kentuckians] need to see on TV is negative political advertising.”\n\nMore recently, McConnell has aired an ad attacking McGrath for what he characterized as “spreading lies” about his early response to the pandemic at a time when he was working in Washington to craft a response.\n\nAmong other things, McGrath has criticized McConnell for attending a judge’s swearing-in ceremony in Louisville on March 13 with Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanugh while the Senate was waiting for an earlier relief bill to be acted upon by the House.\n\nIn one of her recent ads airing in Kentucky, titled “Cooped Up,” McGrath is shown in her living room as her husband and three young children play in the background. She says that her campaign is now focused on the coronavirus response and makes no mention of McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the Senate since 1985.\n\nThe well-funded McGrath still faces a Democratic primary. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) moved the contest back from May 19 to June 23.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1095303, "name": "Emily Yahr"}, "body": "Diffie, though always modest, loved it — last fall, he released a limited-edition vinyl called “Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie!” and started to record new music. So it was especially shocking to the Nashville community on Sunday when Diffie, 61, died due to complications from covid-19. He had revealed his positive diagnosis only a few days before. Almost immediately, social media was flooded with remembrances from his fellow singers, who praised his “pure” voice (Trisha Yearwood) and called him “one of the nicest stars on the planet” (Chris Janson).\n\n“Oh my God. One of the all-time GREAT vocalists. Joe Diffie was my friend. RIP buddy,” Trace Adkins wrote.\n\n“The soundtrack of every bonfire, parking lot, tailgate, jukebox, and cassette player back in high school. We’ll miss you Joe Diffie,” Jessi Alexander tweeted.\n\n“Joe Diffie was one of the reasons I wanted to sing country music,” Caylee Hammack wrote on Instagram.\n\nScrolling through the dozens upon dozens of tributes, it was clear: Diffie meant something different to everyone. There were common themes, as many celebrated him as one of the best voices in country music. Others talked about which songs they loved the most. Artists credited him as an inspiration for their careers.\n\nHe had a huge impact on newer artists, who name-checked him in songs (“Got my honky-tonk attitude from Joe Diffie,” Chris Young sang last year on “Raised on Country”) and appreciated his old-school country look (“Joe Diffie man. … Our love for mullets made me feel connected to you in a special way,” Morgan Wallen tweeted.) Everyone from Luke Bryan to Dustin Lynch to Locash covered “Pickup Man” in concert. Thomas Rhett, a co-writer of Aldean’s “1994,” was four years old at the time of the song’s title, but he still idolized Joe Diffie, and he and co-writers Barry Dean and Luke Laird wrote a whole song about him.\n\n“I was a junior in high school in ’94. Joe Diffie was huge,” Aldean told Billboard about why he decided to record the track. He and his producer thought it was one of the “funniest, coolest” things they had ever heard. “There may be some younger fans that have to do some research and figure out who Joe Diffie is, but obviously people in the business know he’s a great singer and one of the best vocalists we’ve had in this town in years.”\n\nDiffie was beyond flattered by the attention and credited the song with helping him make a comeback after he took a nearly decade-long break from releasing music in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Jason’s great. And I tell you what, I tip my hat to him, because he’s kind of revived my own career,” Diffie told a country radio station after the song was released.\n\nOther words commonly used to describe Diffie on Sunday were “underrated” and “underappreciated.” It may have been true: While Diffie had plenty of huge country hits, he never crossed over to the mainstream audience — partly because the ’90s country music explosion meant there was tons of competition.\n\nBut with ’90s nostalgia all the rage these days, it’s not surprising Nashville singers and fans connect to his classic country ways (that mullet, that honky-tonk twang) more than ever.\n\nSinger Adam Sanders summed it up succinctly in a tribute Sunday: “When you think of ’90s country, you think Joe Diffie. His music will continue to impact generations to come in ways that only a few can.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB1-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1684712, "name": "Edith M"}, "body": "The U.N.’s most powerful body has been meeting by video because of COVID-19, which has hit New York City, where the U.N. has its headquarters, exceedingly hard. The last council meeting in the headquarters complex was on March 12, when a resolution was adopted extending the mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan and welcoming “encouraging developments” toward peace.\n\nA resolution sponsored by the United Kingdom and Germany extends the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur known as UNAMID until May 31 when the council said it will decide on “the responsible draw-down and exit” of UNAMID. The council said it also intends to establish “a follow-on presence to UNAMID” at the same time.\n\nThe Darfur conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. The government in Khartoum was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and unleashing them on civilian populations — a charge it denies. In recent years, as the result of a successful government military campaign, the rebellion has been reduced to a single rebel faction.\n\nThere has been pressure, including from the Trump administration, to scale down the UNAMID force in response to reduced fighting and security conditions. It was established in 2007 and was one of the U.N.’s most expensive operations, with a ceiling of 15,845 military personnel and 3,403 police in June 2016.\n\nIn July 2018, the Security Council voted to dramatically cut the force, with a target to end the mission on June 30, 2020, but the mass street protests by a pro-democracy movement which began in late 2018 and led to last year’s ouster of Al-Bashir and a military-civilian transitional government caused a delay.\n\nAs of January, UNAMID had over 4,300 military personnel, more than 2,100 international police, and about 1,500 civilian staff. The resolution adopted Monday will maintain that force for two months.\n\nA proposed U.N. Security Council resolution obtained by AP earlier this month would replace UNAMID with a U.N. political and peace-building mission whose primary aim would be to support Sudan’s fragile transition to democracy including in drafting a new constitution and preparing for elections. But that proposal could be changed before the council makes a final decision on UNAMID and a follow-on mission at the end of May.\n\nChina, which holds the rotating council presidency in March, sponsored a resolution adopted unanimously stressing “the crucial role” that U.N. peacekeepers play “in achieving conditions for stability and a lasting peace,” and urging countries where they are deployed to ensure their freedom of movement.\n\nU.N. peacekeeping currently has over 100,000 field personnel including military, police and civilians from over 120 countries deployed in 13 active missions across three continents.\n\nThe resolution expresses “grave concern about security threats and targeted attacks” against peacekeepers in many missions, condemns “in the strongest terms” all violence and killings of peacekeeping personnel, and calls for prompt investigation and prosecution of those responsible for attacks against them.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 947391, "name": "Philip Bump"}, "body": "For weeks, those regions defined the outbreak. The spread of the virus at a nursing home in Washington led to dozens of deaths, pushing early mortality figures upward. California took strong measures to halt the spread of the virus earlier than other places, including issuing a shelter-in-place order for a number of counties near San Francisco before such orders were commonplace.\n\nBut a surge in New York quickly pushed the total number of confirmed cases in that state past both Washington and California.\n\nThe number of cases in New York, most of them in New York City, quickly dwarfed the case totals in California and Washington. There have been more confirmed cases in New York than anywhere in the world except China, Italy and Spain. (It’s likely that China is underreporting its case totals, as are countries such as Iran.)\n\nIf we adjust those figures for population, California’s trend stands out. Over the weekend, Santa Clara County, once a potential hotspot of coronavirus infections, announced that it had gone a day without any covid-19-related deaths.\n\nWhat’s interesting to consider is how the three states diverged. California consistently saw slower growth than New York or Washington relative to the point at which each state passed the 1-case-per-1-million-residents mark. New York and Washington saw increases at about the same rate for the first week after passing that point — but then diverged.\n\nWhy? The New York Times explored Washington’s success Sunday. While the state introduced restrictions on large groups and travel later than New York or California relative to the spread each state had seen, state officials drew attention to the problem relatively quickly and made recommendations for preventing the virus’s spread soon after the first death in the state.\n\nOne thing Washington did do was begin testing broadly more quickly. Until less than two weeks ago, Washington was conducting more tests each day than New York state, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project. As a function of population, Washington was completing more tests per million residents than New York as recently as a week ago. Twelve days after each state passed the 1-case-per-million residents mark, Washington was completing 1.7 times as many tests per resident as New York.\n\nThese numbers only tell part of the story. New York’s numbers are also a function of the density of the population in New York City. Statewide testing numbers don’t explain how focused testing can guide efforts to limit the spread of the virus. Case confirmation totals, meanwhile, depend on the number of tests conducted, meaning that all of these figures carry an asterisk of uncertainty.\n\nThe implications of those differences are significant. As of Monday, New Yorkers with the virus might be cared for at the New York City convention center or in pop-up tents in Central Park. Those in medical distress unrelated to coronavirus might end up being cared for on a naval hospital ship in New York Harbor, part of an effort to reduce strain on the city’s hospitals. \n\nOne bit of good news did emerge on Monday, though: emergency room visits are trending downward, suggesting that the measures to curb new infections put into place 10 days ago may be having the desired effect. But the number of cases in the state isn’t expected to peak for several weeks.\n\nExplore the data\n\nThe tool below allows you to display daily case and death data for a variety of regions and

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1113330, "name": "James Mcauley"}, "body": "The painting — a relatively unknown canvas entitled “The Spring Garden,” completed in 1884 — had been loaned to the Singer Laren for a temporary exhibition from the Groninger Museum in Groningen, a city in the northern Netherlands.\n\nThe Singer Laren, which houses the collection of the American artist William Singer and his wife, Anna Singer, had been closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Police are investigating the case and have not identified a suspect.\n\n“I am extremely outraged that this happened,” said Jan Rudolph de Lorm, the museum’s director, at a news conference Monday. Evert van Os, the general manager of the Singer Laren, said that  museum personnel were “angry, shocked, and sad.”\n\nAndreas Blühm,  director of the Groninger, said his museum had lent “The Spring Garden,” its only painting by Van Gogh, to the Singer Laren two months ago. He declined to provide the painting’s value but said that the canvas provided a rare glimpse into the artist’s early development.\n\n“People often tend not to recognize the earlier paintings from this Dutch period, before he moved to Paris,” Blühm said, noting that the parish the painting depicts was where Van Gogh’s father had worked as a pastor. The garden the viewer sees is his father’s garden.\n\n“It has a certain documentary and emotional value,” Blühm said. “It’s quite intimate.”\n\nAlthough authorities have yet to provide many details about the case, the expert Dutch art investigator Arthur Brand, whose research has led to the recovery of hundreds of art works, said that the case would seem to fit with a specific type of art theft that has become a pattern in the Netherlands in recent years.\n\nIn June 1990, Brand said, three Van Gogh paintings — “The Sitting Farmer’s Wife,” “The Digging Farmer’s Wife” and “Wheels of the Water Mill in Gennep,” all from 1884 — were stolen from a similarly small Dutch museum, the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch, a small city in the central Netherlands.\n\nThose canvases ultimately turned up in the possession of the Dutch drug lord Kees Houtman, who later attempted to use them, Brand said, as a bargaining chip to negotiate a shortened sentence with prosecutors. Houtman was killed in 2005.\n\nIn 1991, there was also a major failed heist at Amsterdam’s Van Gogh National Museum, when gunmen stole 20 paintings early in the morning but then abandoned them at a nearby train station some 35 minutes later.\n\nThe same museum was targeted in 2002, when two other Van Gogh canvases — “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” (1882) and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Neunen” (1882-1884) — were stolen. They turned up later in the possession of  Italian mobster Raffaele Imperiale, who  resides in Dubai, from which Italian authorities are seeking his extradition. Like Houtman, Imperiale ultimately attempted to use the return of the Van Gogh paintings in exchange for a shortened sentence for drug trafficking, to which he had confessed, albeit in absentia.\n\nAfter Imperiale provided their whereabouts to authorities, the two stolen paintings were recovered in 2016 and later returned to the Van Gogh museum.\n\nBoth Brand and Blühm doubted that the Singer Laren museum’s coronavirus closure somehow facilitated the crime: The theft occurred early in the morning when the museum would have been closed even during a normal week, and all normal security protocols were  in place.\n\n“These guys were professionals. They did it four or five minutes,” Brand said, referring to Monday’s heist. “They knew exactly what they were looking for — they went straight to this painting. It rang a bell.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB10-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB10-4", "parent":

Up until last week, he had been training at American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose before flying home to Russia.\n\n“Currently I am in Dagestan and I am training and preparing every day. Although I don’t know what am I preparing for,” Nurmagomedov said, per RT’s translation. “Because after we came to Russia we also learned that the borders are going to be locked. Same like in the States, same like in Europe, Emirates, everywhere. The whole world is in quarantine right now.”\n\nWhite declined to say where UFC 249 would take place last week, though he had said previously that it would not take place in the United States. On Monday, Nurmagomedov said UFC had given him “99 percent” assurance that the card would go on in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, though that country also has restricted travel because of coronavirus.\n\nNow, according to Nurmagomedov, UFC might be looking to stage UFC 249 without him.\n\n“So now I am hearing that they are looking to organize it with or without me. Okay, go ahead,” he said.\n\n“Everyone should follow the laws. I am not against it, I know that fighters need to feed their families and pay their bills. I know how hard it is for the fighter. Unless they fight they aren't getting any money.\n\n“I am even hearing that they are looking for an opponent for Tony, because he is in the States and I am here in Russia. But I am here not on my own will.”\n\nEarly Monday morning on Twitter, Ferguson accused Nurmagomedov of “hiding in Russia” and said he was using the pandemic “as an excuse to back out.”\n\n“You Have Been Sent Many Locations, Send Us 1,” he wrote.\n\nUFC has canceled the three cards that were scheduled to take place before UFC 249, but White has been adamant that UFC 249 will go on with a full card of bouts but without fans present. Should the Nurmagomedov-Ferguson match be postponed, it will be the fifth time their scheduled meeting has not taken place over the years.\n\nESPN’s Ariel Helwani reported Monday morning that UFC has offered Ferguson a fight against top contender Justin Gaethje, though the fight and the location of the fight have yet to be finalized.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-20", "level":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1541878, "name": "Liz Clarke"}, "body": "“Wimbledon will decide to cancel on Wednesday,” German Tennis Federation vice president Dirk Hordorff told Sky Sports Germany, alluding to an emergency All England Club board meeting scheduled that day. “There is no doubt about it. This is necessary in the current situation.\n\n“It is completely unrealistic to imagine that with the travel restrictions that we currently have an international tennis tournament where hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world would travel. That is unthinkable.”\n\nOther options have been considered for Wimbledon, including postponement, as French Open officials previously announced they intend to do with the season’s second major, shifting the clay-court classic from its late-May start to late-September.\n\nBecause Wimbledon is contested on grass, which is extremely costly and labor-intensive to maintain, it can’t be easily postponed. The window for competing on the All England Club’s grass doesn’t extend past late summer.\n\nMoreover, the international tennis calendar is extremely crowded and now further complicated by the French Open’s decision to shift its start to Sept. 20, just one week after the U.S. Open and in conflict with the Laver Cup, an all-star event co-founded by Roger Federer that is scheduled Sept. 25-27 in Boston. The move, made without consultation of the other Grand Slams or players’ organizations, has drawn sharp criticism for its perceived arrogance.\n\nMore significantly, an alternate date for Wimbledon has been complicated by the plain fact that the duration of the coronavirus is unknowable. Any notion of shoehorning it into the July 23-Aug. 8 original window of the now-postponed 2020 Tokyo Olympics would represent a considerable leap of faith.\n\nIt will mark the first time since 1945 that Wimbledon has not been contested. It will also be the first time in history that the tournament hasn’t been contested for reasons other than world wars. The tournament wasn’t held in 1915-18 because of World War I; it was suspended again from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II.\n\nAssuming the U.S. Open is held as scheduled, Aug. 24-Sept. 13, Wimbledon’s cancellation will reduce the number of Grand Slams held in 2020 from four to three at a time when the game’s greatest players are fighting age and younger rivals to add to their career tally of major championships.\n\nRoger Federer, who’ll turns 39 in August, leads all men with 20 Grand Slam titles. Rafael Nadal, who will turn 34 in June, has 19. And Novak Djokovic, 32, claimed in 17th in winning the Australian Open, the first major of 2020.\n\nOn the women’s side, Serena Williams is without peer in the modern era, with 23 Grand Slam singles titles. Yet at 38, she is chasing the one goal to elude her: tying and surpassing Margaret Court’s record 24 majors.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-40", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 963743, "name": "Matt Bonesteel"}, "body": "Nurmagomedov was scheduled to fight Tony Ferguson at UFC 249, which originally was to take place in Brooklyn, N.Y., on April 18 before New York banned large gatherings. Up until last week, he had been training at American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose before flying home to Russia.\n\n“Currently I am in Dagestan and I am training and preparing every day. Although I don’t know what am I preparing for,” Nurmagomedov said, per RT’s translation. “Because after we came to Russia we also learned that the borders are going to be locked. Same like in the States, same like in Europe, Emirates, everywhere. The whole world is in quarantine right now.”\n\nWhite declined to say where UFC 249 would take place last week, though he had said previously that it would not take place in the United States. On Monday, Nurmagomedov said UFC had given him “99 percent” assurance that the card would go on in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, though that country also has restricted travel because of coronavirus.\n\nNow, according to Nurmagomedov, UFC might be looking to stage UFC 249 without him.\n\n“So now I am hearing that they are looking to organize it with or without me. Okay, go ahead,” he said.\n\n“Everyone should follow the laws. I am not against it, I know that fighters need to feed their families and pay their bills. I know how hard it is for the fighter. Unless they fight they aren't getting any money.\n\n“I am even hearing that they are looking for an opponent for Tony, because he is in the States and I am here in Russia. But I am here not on my own will.”\n\nEarly Monday morning on Twitter, Ferguson accused Nurmagomedov of “hiding in Russia” and said he was using the pandemic “as an excuse to back out.”\n\n“You Have Been Sent Many Locations, Send Us 1,” he wrote.\n\nUFC has canceled the three cards that were scheduled to take place before UFC 249, but White has been adamant that UFC 249 will go on with a full card of bouts but without fans present. Should the Nurmagomedov-Ferguson match be postponed, it will be the fifth time their scheduled meeting has not taken place over the years.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-20",

He was hospitalized on March 20 after developing a fever and breathing troubles, and was put on on a ventilator.\n\nThe news of his death comes as new cases have spiked in Tokyo, with the city’s governor warning of an explosive spread of the virus in the region. The news topped Japanese television news and talk shows on Monday, and fans and media gathered outside the hospital where he had been treated.\n\nTokyo had 68 new cases of the virus on Sunday, bringing its prefectural total to 430. Nationwide, Japan has confirmed 2,578 cases, including 712 from a cruise ship.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nShimura was a former member of the comedy rock band the Drifters, a household name in the 1970s and 1980s, and gained fame while starring in the group’s prime-time comedy show “It’s 8 o’clock, Gather Everyone!”\n\nBorn Yasunori Shimura, he recently was known for his popular character Baka Tonosama (Stupid Warlord) on TV comedy shows. He also led his comedy theater, Shimurakon (Shimura Spirit), since 2006.\n\nHe also was known as a fan of the late American comedian Jerry Lewis and had drawn inspiration from him.\n\nShimura’s death came as he was preparing for a new film. He was also to run in the Olympic torch relay to represent Higashimurayama, a town in Tokyo’s suburbs, his agency said.\n\n“I don’t think Shimura himself expected to have to go this way,” an Izawa Office staff member told reporters, adding that his comedy shows were still upcoming on TV.\n\n“I hope you will remember him and laugh,” he said. “Until the end, he was committed to present laughter to the people.”\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2392860, "name": "Rosana Pinheiro-machado"}, "body": "Brazilians are feeling a lot of anxiety and can no longer bear this lack of leadership. For weeks, they have protested from their homes by banging saucepans and shouting “Bolsonaro out” from their windows. Support for his impeachment has risen drastically, according to Atlas Politico, with almost half of the population backing his removal.\n\nIn recent days, Bolsonaro has contradicted his own health experts, calling self-isolation “mass confinement” and covid-19 a “little cold.” He attended a rally and shook hands with supporters on March 15, drawing criticism for encouraging large gatherings. He also told his followers, via social media and official channels, to attend a demonstration on March 25 in support of his administration. And he has been ignoring recommendations to practice social distancing after members of his own staff tested positive for the virus.\n\nIt’s clear Bolsonaro has abandoned his duty to protect the population. He thinks the deadly virus is a media trick. “They spread the sensation of dread,\" he said on March 24. \"The perfect scenario to be used by the media to spread hysteria.”\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus could collapse the public health system in Brazil. Thankfully, health-care professionals and local and state governments are mobilizing to respond to cases and asking people to stay home, openly defying a president already calling for a return to “normality” and to work.\n\nMembers of the National Congress from different parties have started calling for impeachment. But there is no consensus among the opposition. Some, citing the constitution, argue in favor of mental health interdiction of the president; others say Congress should invoke the social protection provision. Some simply want Bolsonaro to implode, letting him “bleed” until the next election, in 2022.\n\nOn March 17, some members of Congress formally introduced an impeachment request signed by scientists, artists, activists and public intellectuals. Citizens and organized civil society have gotten behind the petition to impeach. Since then, close to 1 million people have signed it. It’s clear that, beyond any political calculation, allowing Bolsonaro to stay in power is unsustainable.\n\nSince his election, Bolsonaro has led Brazil by following a fascist playbook, attacking the press and indigenous peoples, eroding human rights protections, and offering apologies for dictatorship and torture. He has gone from breach of decorum to abuse of power to attacks against the constitution. His mismanagement of the coronavirus has only intensified his crimes of irresponsibility.\n\nImpeachment can be a difficult political and legal process. (Brazilians not long ago lived through a politicized and unfair process against Dilma Rousseff that amounted to a coup.) But the case against Bolsonaro is bulletproof. Today he represents an existential threat. There must be both deep political articulation and social legitimacy to carry out his removal, and a transition must be carefully planned.\n\nBrazilians are now rejecting Bolsonaro’s legitimacy. Our political leaders must move forward and vote to impeach him.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2389960, "name": "Peggy Mcglone;michael Andor Brodeur"}, "body": "In a conference call Friday night, Rutter told orchestra leaders that the 96 musicians would receive their last paycheck on April 3 and that they will not be paid until the arts center reopens. In addition, she said their health care benefits would stop at the end of May if the arts center is still closed at that time. The announcement was characterized by several NSO members as a shock.\n\nEd Malaga, president of Local 161-710 of the American Federation of Musicians, described the decision as outrageous and said the union has filed a grievance challenging what it believes is an illegal action.\n\n“This decision, from an organization with an endowment of nearly $100 million, is not only outrageous — coming after the musicians had expressed their willingness to discuss ways to accommodate the Kennedy Center during this challenging time — it is also blatantly illegal under the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. That agreement specifically requires that the Center provide six weeks’ notice before it can stop paying musicians for economic reasons,” Malaga said in a statement.\n\nThe musicians' contract does not include what is known as a force majeure clause, a typical provision in contracts that allows one side to renege on the agreement if there is a situation beyond its control. Most of the arts center's other union contracts, with stagehands and box office workers, for example, include this clause. Many of those employees were laid off in mid-March.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Rutter said the $25 million from the $2.2 trillion federal stimulus package was intended to support the arts center's mission as a presidential memorial. A two-month closure, representing the most optimistic scenario, would result in income losses of $20 million, she said.\n\nWith no money coming in, the arts center needed help to pay its estimated $6 million monthly costs, she said,\n\n“It’s not a bailout,” Rutter said. “It will hopefully allow us to keep the personnel together, to keep the organization going.”\n\nRutter told her staff earlier in the week that she was suspending her $1.2 million salary until the crisis ended, saying she needed to be the first, and that more cuts were coming.\n\nCellist Steven Honigberg, a member of the orchestra since 1984, posted the news on Facebook. “This is of course shocking news to the 96 symphony musicians under union contract — and this despite a $25 million boost earmarked specifically for the Kennedy Center in today’s passed historic stimulus bill that is designed to help employees maintain footing during this pandemic war,” Honigberg wrote. “This edict from Kennedy Center’s President Deborah Rutter, out of the blue, is illegal in various forms and will certainly be contested by expensive lawyers. Thanks (NOT) Deborah for your compassion for the musicians of your National Symphony Orchestra in this time of unprecedented peril. This is not OUR fault.”\n\nWhen reached Saturday, the orchestra’s spokeswoman said she had just learned of the decision. Rutter could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn February, the coronavirus forced the orchestra to cancel a trip to Japan and China that would have taken place this month — its first international tour under the baton of Gianandrea Noseda. Another highlight of the season, “Beethoven at 250,” featuring the orchestra performing and recording all nine symphonies between May 28 and June 14, has not been canceled.", "categories":

The Mall route is suspended for the duration of the coronavirus emergency.\n\nThe city last week suspended fares on all Circulator routes and asked passengers to board the bus through the rear door. The all-door entry policy enables better social distancing. Riders with wheelchairs can still use the front door to board using the lift.\n\nSuperior Court judge limits  bench warrants\n\nIn an effort to reduce arrests and court appearances, D.C. Superior Court Chief Judge Robert E. Morin on Friday suspended the issuance of bench warrants for failure to appear in court in all misdemeanor cases except for domestic violence, sex abuse and indecent exposure.\n\nThe suspensions are in effect until May 15. Morin wrote the decision was in collaboration with D.C. police and the U.S. attorney’s office in the District.\n\n“In light of the current public health and judicial emergencies declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Morin wrote, “and recognizing arresting a person wanted on most misdemeanor bench warrants during the public health emergency presents a health risk to the person, law enforcement, and others that outweigh the interest of the public in the speedy resolution of these case,” he ordered the temporary suspensions of the bench warrants.\n\nMorin also suspended weekend jail orders until June 5. Individuals convicted of various misdemeanor offenses such as DUI are often sentenced to weekends in jails, especially if the defendant is employed during the week.\n\nJudges order release of at least 10 defendants\n\nFederal judges in the District have ordered the release of at least 10 defendants in the past week after defense attorneys cited the coronavirus outbreak and jail conditions.\n\nThe federal defenders office of the District said that judges are releasing some inmates from jail for two reasons: they have health issues, or their lawyers had not been able to communicate with them. The D.C. Jail had required that meetings with defense counsel occur in person; it is now allowing such meetings to occur by video conference, but there can be long waits.\n\nProsecutors joined the defense motions in several cases, while other joint motions remain pending. However, the U.S. attorney’s office is opposing many others. Defendants who have been ordered released typically suffer from medical conditions such as leukemia, asthma, kidney disease or other unspecified ailments that put them at heightened risk for infections and serious medical complications, according to court filings.\n\nMost were released to high-intensity supervision or home confinement or were to complete sentences under supervision or less restrictive conditions.\n\nCourt extends state of emergency three weeks\n\nVirginia’s court system will remain under a state of emergency for at least another month, the state Supreme Court declared Friday, meaning all civil, traffic and criminal cases will be postponed, except for emergencies and urgent matters, through April 26. The courthouses, however, remain open.\n\nChief Justice Donald W. Lemons originally issued an order March 16, in response to a request from Gov. Ralph Northam (D), declaring a state of emergency for the state’s courts through April 6. Lemons’s order Friday extends that for three more weeks.\n\nLemons said judges should “exercise their discretion as necessary in determining whether the matter is urgent.”", "categories":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 965487, "name": "Alex Horton"}, "body": "The coronavirus pandemic has produced analogies to the conflict that, while imperfect, have provided symmetry to a message that the United States drilled into the public in the 1940s — everyone has a role to play in a collective struggle, and individual choices that feel small can later snowball into grim consequences.\n\nArmy Capt. Victoria Kositz watched the comparisons hum on social media and, in apparent exasperation of what the analogies had left out, created a stylized poster for the pandemic age.\n\nIt didn’t take long for others to chime in, creating more than a dozen vintage poster spinoffs that highlighted the work and dangers that doctors and nurses have faced.\n\n“If anyone else wants to make WW2 propaganda posters but with health care workers and other essential labor, please add to the thread,” Kositz wrote Tuesday. “Not like we’ve got anywhere else to be.”\n\nBrian Wilson, 35, a former firefighter-EMT who deployed to Iraq with the National Guard as a combat medic, ran with the idea while social distancing at his home in Houston.\n\n“The World War II mentality was that everybody had to come together,” he told The Washington Post on Thursday. “The fact that I can swap these out and have the same message is fascinating.”\n\nCoronavirus is a nearly invisible enemy without a banner, a barely alive, spiky orb one-thousandth the width of an eyelash wide. There is no treaty on the horizon. Its drive, if you can call a deadly infection that, is purely biological, not ideological.\n\nBut some other comparisons to conflict make sense, Wilson said.\n\nIt has become clear that the virus, which has killed at least 1,000 people in the United States and ground civil society to a halt, has forced Americans to settle in for a long bout of uncertainty — giving rise to how everyone can be part of some solution.\n\nOther posters Wilson and others made, like those from World War II before them, force a feeling of guilt and selfishness after individual choices.\n\nWasting food and not donating scrap metal harmed the war effort, posters in the 1940s scolded. Now it’s not washing your stands and going outside, Wilson said.\n\nThe pandemic has also given rise to new champions of public service. Doctors and nurses have been heralded for their dangerous and unforgiving work in a way that has been mostly reserved for combat troops and veterans.\n\n“Are our health care professionals going to be the new soldiers?” Wilson asked.\n\nWatching health workers rise to the challenge from home has been difficult for Wilson, whose EMT and medic service spurred him into community building with veterans.\n\nBut he found another way to contribute. He is wrapping up the first year at the South Texas College of Law and is among the oldest in his class. Many younger students are new to Houston and struggling with how to adjust in a new place under extraordinary circumstances.\n\n“I’m the adopted uncle,” he said. “So I’m keeping tabs on them, more or less figuring out what the new normal is.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB25-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB25-5",

A record-shattering 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits in a single week.\n\nMeanwhile, all child care programs in the state are to be closed by the end of the day Friday, Karen Salmon announced on the state board of education’s website. Salmon noted that the state has established child care programs to serve only designated essential personnel. The announcement comes a day after she announced that Maryland was extending school closings for four weeks through April 24.\n\nMaryland announced the state has confirmed at least 580 cases of the virus. That’s 157 more cases than the day before, the highest one-day total increase yet. Maryland has had at least four deaths due to the virus.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more serve illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Maryland Board of Elections announced it is planning to do away with polling stations for the state’s already delayed primary. Voters would instead be required to mail in or drop off their ballots in an effort to limit coronavirus infections.\n\nIf approved, the move would eliminate any need for Maryland’s more than 4 million registered voters to cast their ballots in person on June 2, according to a draft presented by elections officials at their Wednesday meeting, held by teleconference.\n\nThe state’s primary was originally scheduled for April 28. Gov. Larry Hogan postponed it by executive order on March 17.\n\nBallots, with clear instructions explaining how to return them, would likely need to be mailed to all registered voters by the end of April, Nikki Charlson, deputy administrator for the Board of Elections, said during Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and

Canada relies on cross border trade for essential goods like food and medicine.\n\nFreeland said people who have already returned should be self-isolating at home already, noting it is critical to protect the health of Canadians and ultimately to ensure that the country’s economic rebound comes more quickly.\n\n“If we can flatten the curve then we can go back to normal life more quickly,” she said.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced his government will offer $2,000 Canadian (US$1,395) a month, for the next four months, for workers who lose their income as a result of the pandemic.\n\nTrudeau said Canada is facing a once in a generation challenge and noted a million Canadians applied for employment insurance in a week.\n\n“Help is on the way,” Trudeau said.\n\nTrudeau said if a Canadian loses their job because of COVID-19 — whether they are full-time, contract or self-employed — the new benefit is available. He said it also covers a person who is sick or quarantined, or looking after someone sick. Workers still employed but not receiving income because of the crisis are eligible.\n\nHis government also it would implemented long-promised tax credits for newspapers where they can can claim on up to 25% of wages.\n\nTrudeau made the remarks outside his residence, where he is in isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus. He says his wife is doing “much much better” and he and his kids have no symptoms.\n\nCanada is now testing 10,000 people a day and has tested more than 142,000 people. Canada has more than 3,336 confirmed cases and at least 35 deaths.\n\nIn the Atlantic Coast province of Newfoundland, 44 of the province’s 67 cases are linked to a funeral home in St. John’s, where an individual who tested positive attended visitations at some point between March 15 and 17.\n\nThe Pacific Coast province of British Columbia government, meanwhile, is suspending evictions and offering a $500 monthly rebate to help renters and landlords during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The Canadian Olympic committee said before the decision it would not send a team to Tokyo in 2020.\n\nEven Trump said on March 12 at the White House that the Olympics should be postponed for a year.\n\nThe IOC board’s eventual decision on Tuesday, with Japanese government agreement, to delay until 2021 came a day after the World Health Organization said the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating.\n\nBach was also asked by a reporter from his native Germany if he had thought of resigning because of the athletes’ criticism.\n\nThe postponement calls for the Tokyo Games to take place no later than the summer 2021, and Bach was asked about options if the pandemic continued into next year.\n\n“We want, and we will, organize the games only in a safe environment,” he said.\n\nAlthough an exact one-year postponement to July 23-Aug. 8 is possible, the Tokyo Games don’t have to open in July.\n\n“All the options are on the table,” Bach said, adding that a task force of IOC and Japanese officials named “Here We Go” is looking at new dates.\n\n“This task force can consider the broader picture. This is not just restricted to the summer months,” Bach said.\n\nThe IOC president called for compromise on all sides as the biggest sports event of 2020 now lands in the already congested calendar of 2021. Both track and swimming have their world championships scheduled for next year in July and August.\n\n“This postponed Olympic Game will need sacrifices,” Bach said.\n\nOne issue for Tokyo organizers is retaining control of the village set to house most of the 11,000 athletes. The sprawling site on Tokyo Bay of more than 5,600 apartments is to be sold off after the Olympics. About 25% have reportedly been sold, with some costing more than $1 million.\n\n“It is one of the many thousands of questions this task force will have to address,” Bach said.\n\nOne potential problem looks easily resolved. Sponsors whose IOC deals expire this year will continue through the rescheduled games, which will still be called the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They include Dow, General Electric and PG.\n\n“We see their full support for this,” Bach said. “For me, it’s a logical consequence that the sponsors ... keep their rights even if the games are organized in ’21.”\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

McGregor declared that much more was needed, including closing airports and deploying military units as necessary to enforce a lockdown before Ireland suffers the same fate as neighbors such as Italy.\n\nâ€œWe have the advantage here in that we can see this coming. We can see this coming!â€� exclaimed the 31-year old McGregor. â€œBut if we do not act on our advantage, we cannot expect different results. We are not adhering to social distancing, at least not to the extent required to halt exponential growth. A lockdown would facilitate this.\"\n\nThe video marked a dramatic shift in tone from some of McGregorâ€™s previous public comments regarding the pandemic, including an Instagram post on March 13 in which he wrote, â€œI believe we have this virus contained,â€� and, â€œTo the people of the world.

Congratulations!â€�\n\nOn Saturday, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion used another Instagram post to remind his compatriots to â€œstay vigilant with our quarantine efforts.â€� Noting a drop at the time in daily cases of covid-19, McGregor warned against a temptation to â€œget out and back to living our normal lives again,â€� lest people â€œrun the risk of going around in circles with these numbers until they hit a spike we then canâ€™t contain.â€�\n\nMcGregorâ€™s plea Tuesday came a day after British heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury posted his own Instagram video exhorting his countrymen to â€œstay indoors.â€�\n\nâ€œLetâ€™s fight this virus together as a nation, as a family, as a team and do the best we can to help others donâ€™t get the virus,â€� Fury said.\n\nThe torrent of sports-event postponements related to the coronavirus, which grew Tuesday with the Tokyo Summer Olympics, also includes Furyâ€™s trilogy showdown against Deontay Wilder. Originally set for July 18 after Wilder exercised a rematch clause following his loss to Fury last month, the pairâ€™s third title bout will likely take place sometime in the fall (per ESPN).\n\nWhile UFC President Dana White searches for a place to stage an April 18 card featuring a much-anticipated lightweight title bout between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson, McGregor doesnâ€™t have a fight lined up. The Dublin native, who knocked out welterweight Donald Cerrone in just 40 seconds in January, said recently he expects to â€œbe in the Octagon again soon,â€� but for now he has his eye on domestic and global events far beyond the world of combat sports.\n\nRegarding his call for a â€œtrue lockdown,â€� McGregor said Tuesday, â€œThese methods are stringent but necessary and have worked in China and Hong Kong.\"\n\nâ€œIreland, weâ€™ve got this,â€� he continued. â€œNot only do we have the formula, we have it ahead of time. Letâ€™s go, Ireland. Letâ€™s go, rest of the world. Lock down united. Together we stand. God bless us all.â€�", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB17-5", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1938175, "name": "Jon Herskovitz"}, "body": "1. So when will the games begin?\n\nThat is still unclear. Beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021. That’s what the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers said in a statement announcing the unprecedented postponement on March 24.\n\n2. Is it a straightforward switch?\n\nHardly. It raises numerous logistical headaches, from how to treat athletes who already qualified for the world’s biggest multisports event to the status of tickets and sponsorships already sold. A raft of sponsorship agreements are set to expire in 2020. Then there are possible clashes with other sporting events, such as the 2021 global track-and-field championships in Eugene, Oregon, which may now be moved to 2022. The scale of next year’s Olympics also has yet to be decided, according to the senior Japanese organizer. That implies not all of the 339 events in 33 sports are assured a place.\n\n3. Might the Olympics be canceled?\n\nNot according to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While postponement is a painful blow, it’s far preferable to cancellation for organizers, sponsors, broadcasters and others that have billions of dollars invested in the games. Japan has spent an estimated $26 billion on preparations and calling the games off could knock about 1.4% from gross domestic product, Nikko Securities Inc. Chief Economist Junichi Makino wrote in a recent research note.\n\n4. What will postponement cost?\n\nA one-year delay would trigger about 641 billion yen ($5.8 billion) in economic losses, according to an estimate by Katsuhiro Miyamoto, an honorary professor at Japan’s Kansai University. A large part of the economic stimulus may have already been delivered by the massive infrastructure spending laid out to get Tokyo ready for the games.\n\n5. Has an Olympics ever been called off?\n\nFive Olympic Games were scrapped, all because of World War: The summer games were canceled in 1916, 1940 and 1944 as were the winter games in 1940 and 1944. The 1940 games were initially postponed, but then canceled.\n\n6. Why not call it Tokyo 2021?\n\nOrganizers said they want the games to stand as a beacon of hope and the Olympic flame to become the ”light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present.” Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan and the event will keep the name Tokyo 2020, according to the March 24 statement.\n\n7. Were there any other options?\n\nThe World Health Organization and sports federations discussed the possibility of staging the event without spectators, the New York Times reported. Keeping fans out in this way has never happened at an Olympics, but multiple major sporting events including Japanese sumo wrestling have in recent weeks gone ahead “behind closed doors.” Given the global spread of the coronavirus, there were no realistic alternative venues. The only time an Olympics got switched was when the 1976 winter games were moved to Innsbruck, Austria, from Denver after locals protested spiraling costs.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":

(Kevin Ambrose) \n  District police have blocked roads to the Tidal Basin to prevent crowds from gathering to view the world-famous cherry blossoms in Washington. It’s an effort to enforce social distancing and stop the spread of the coronavirus. These are unprecedented times, even for blossom viewing.\n Because I can’t visit the Tidal Basin this week to shoot photos, I decided to look back at my photos from past years to remember the splendor of the cherry blossoms. We’ve had some beautiful blooms over the years!\n I’ve photographed cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin every year since 2004, and I’ve included a few of my favorite shots from past years. The dates of the photos are included in the captions, so check out how some years have early-season blooms while other years have blooms that occur later.\n Let’s hope next year returns to normal, and we can go back to the Tidal Basin and walk the trail, enjoying the blossoms in person.\n If you’re itching to see the scene this year, you can, of course, watch the live stream on your screens, and the blossoms still appear to be in peak bloom. And, many neighborhoods around the city and greater region have cherry trees which can be enjoyed on your socially distant walk.\n    An early-season bloom occurred in 2012. The photo was taken on March 16, 2012. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    Late-season blooms occurred in 2014 and 2015. This photo was taken on April 11, 2014. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    Do you remember when the freeze of 2017 seemed to be the worst possible event for cherry blossom viewing? Half of the blossoms were killed by cold temperatures that year. This photo was taken on March 14, 2017. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    A tranquil scene with ducks on the Tidal Basin on March 26, 2016. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial with cherry blossoms nearby, taken on April 5, 2018. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    A particularly beautiful and peaceful sunrise with the cherry blossoms on April 10, 2005. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    Cherry blossoms on the Mall, April 2, 2007. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    The Japanese Lantern with the cherry blossoms approaching peak bloom, taken on April 4, 2018. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    A line of strong thunderstorms blasted the cherry blossoms with gusty wind and heavy rain on April 3, 2006. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    A calm and cloud-free sunrise was perfect for cherry blossom viewing on April 12, 2015. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    A cherry blossom close-up, taken on March 31, 2009. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    A well-dressed pup checks out the cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin on April 5, 2018. (Kevin Ambrose) \n    This cool pup was photographed last year on March 31.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1693759, "name": "Nisha Gopalan"}, "body": "In immediate terms, the HK$7.22 billion ($930 million) offer is attractive, representing a 150% premium to the stock’s closing price before the bid was made public. Long-term shareholders who kept faith in the company’s plans to restructure, digitize its operations and diversify sourcing away from China are unlikely to be impressed. Li  Fung shares had fallen 98% from their 2011 high as of Friday’s close. The offer premium pares that loss to 94%.\n\nAs the world’s biggest supplier of consumer goods, Li  Fung designs, sources and transports products from Asia to retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Nike Inc. There are many factors behind its long decline, from rising factory wages in China to the “retail apocalypse” hollowing out American main streets. The U.S.-China trade war dealt another grievous blow to a business model that depended on linking factories in Asia with American retailers. The coronavirus, which shut down swathes of China’s economy and threatens to drive the world into recession, may have been the final straw.\n\nThe biggest driver of Li  Fung’s downfall, though, may be the rise of e-commerce and, specifically, of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Jack Ma’s internet behemoth connected Chinese producers with overseas buyers directly, finally obviating the need for a comprador-type service to negotiate the pitfalls on behalf of foreign companies. At the same time, the tightening grip of e-commerce retailers in the U.S., principally Amazon.com Inc., has undermined the bricks-and-mortars retailers such as Macy’s Inc. and Kohl’s Corp. on which Li  Fung relied.\n\nChief Executive Officer Spencer Fung, whose great-grandfather founded the company more than a century ago, and GLP, a logistics firm that was taken private in 2018  in a private equity-backed management buyout, will now seek a revival away from the glare of the public markets. It’s not the first time Li  Fung has gone private, having withdrawn in the 1980s before listing again in 1992, as Vinicy Chan and Daniela Wei of Bloomberg News  wrote Monday.\n\nRepeating the trick will be more difficult this time. Unlike the privatization of another storied Hong Kong business, the real estate company Wheelock  Co., this isn’t a purchase of undervalued tangible assets that can (arguably) be expected to revive with a turn in the market cycle. Li  Fung has long prided itself on its “asset light” model. As a result, the company has typically traded at high multiples of its book value — averaging 7.3 times in the decade through 2010. Even in its present depressed state, Li  Fung is being taken private at a premium to book.\n\nLi  Fung’s value lies in intangibles such as its network of relationships with factories and buyers. What are these worth now, after the whole model has been upended? The company has pushed into the higher-margin logistics business. This, though, made up only 10% of revenue last year, insignificant beside the 77% that sourcing contributed. \n\nThe fundamental trouble for Li  Fung is that the world appears to have changed irrevocably. If the company does return to public markets one day, it’s likely to be in a radically different form.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nNisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

The VHSL plans to announce a decision the same day.\n\n“Our Crisis Management team is made up of excellent school representatives and has been vital in all deliberations regarding COVID-19,” Haun said. “In every situation, every decision we make has been, and will be, in the best interest of public health, including that of, most importantly, our student-athletes, coaches, administrators and families.”\n\nThe spring sports in Virginia are baseball, softball, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and outdoor track. All winter sports in the state were able to finish their seasons aside from basketball, which abruptly stopped in mid-March, just before many teams were set to play the state semifinals and championships. The state awarded co-champions in most classes.\n\nThe Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association also announced Monday it won’t sanction its spring championships.\n\nBefore Monday, the VHSL had pushed back the beginning of its spring season to March 30, with no team activities occurring within a two-week span. Still, with most professional and college leagues canceling or postponing their seasons, Monday’s announcement wasn’t a surprise.\n\nLast week, D.C.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1192330, "name": "Lori Rozsa"}, "body": "The emotional meeting on March 19 is an example of a the tug-of-war happening nationwide as politicians at all levels try to figure out the best ways to deal with the threats to health and the economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Palm Beach County has the third-highest number of reported cases in the state, with 22, although none are in the city of Lake Worth Beach.\n\nHardy, 30, elected to the council three years ago, said he had been trying since March 12 to get the city to take some action. It took him a week to get the council to agree to an emergency meeting.\n\nIn the video, filmed by the city and posted online by the Palm Beach Post, Hardy is imploring his fellow council members to stop cutting off the electricity to customers who are late on their bills. The city runs the electric and water utilities. The mayor tries to end the discussion and the meeting, but Hardy isn’t done.\n\n“Are you telling me that you’re going to keep me from talking?” Hardy said. “This gentleman here has turned off people’s lights in the middle of a global pandemic.”\n\nHardy was referring to city manager Michael Bornstein. Mayor Pam Triolo tried to end the meeting, but Hardy wasn’t done.\n\n“We could have banned large public gatherings, we could have closed the beach, we could have put a moratorium on utility cutoffs,” Hardy said. “We should have been talking about this last week. We cut off people’s utilities this week and made them pay what could have been their last paycheck to us to turn their lights on.”\n\nThe mayor got up and walked away.\n\n“You’re done. You’re done,” Triolo said. “Disrespectful.”\n\nThe city did end up taking some action — it closed the city-owned golf course, and agreed to a more generous paid-leave policy for employees. It never closed its popular beach, though, where an average of 3,000 people a day gather. The beach closed only after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered three counties in South Florida to close all beaches.\n\n“It’s not a large beach, but it’s very popular, so people are very concentrated on it,” Hardy said. “The city has done nothing.”\n\nOn the city’s Facebook page, Triolo said that Hardy was bullying the city commission and that the exchange between them “created a lot of undue stress and emotion.”\n\nShe said she did what she needed to do when she tried to cut him off.\n\n“While I took the right action, I apologize for the way it had to be done,” she wrote.\n\nBornstein said the two-minute video from the hour-long meeting portrays the city unfairly. Officials were waiting to see what other utility companies were doing before taking action on late bill payers, he said.\n\nFPL, one of the largest electricity providers in the state, suspended utility cutoffs March 16. Lake Worth Beach issued a similar order two days later.\n\nBornstein said the day after the meeting, he decided to send refund checks to the approximately 100 customers whose electricity had been shut off earlier in the week.\n\n“We’re going to take an extraordinary effort that I can tell you no other cities are making,” Bornstein said.\n\nHardy said the city council needs to declare a state of emergency in Lake Worth Beach so residents will be protected.\n\n“Lake Worth is 10 minutes from Mar-a-Lago, but we’re the second-poorest city in Palm Beach County,” Hardy said, referring to President Trump’s resort. “Our working-class families may have seen their last paycheck for the foreseeable future. It doesn’t seem right to turn off their electricity in the middle of a pandemic.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB21-1", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.”\n\nPaul’s office added that the senator “expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends” and that “virtually no staff” has had contact with him since Paul’s Washington office began operating remotely 10 days ago.\n\nPaul received his test results Sunday morning, according to his deputy chief of staff, Sergio Gor.\n\nPaul, 57, is in his second term in the Senate. Last year, he revealed that part of his lung was surgically removed because of injuries he sustained in 2017 when he was attacked by his neighbor. Paul also traveled to Ontario, Canada, last year to have hernia surgery, which he said was related to the 2017 assault.\n\nThe news of Paul’s coronavirus diagnosis sparked concern Sunday on Capitol Hill, where the Kentucky Republican has been present in recent days as lawmakers have been working on a financial relief package in response to the pandemic.\n\nRoy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, said he was not certain how the Senate should handle lawmakers being in the Capitol complex at the moment. He suggested that members should finish their work on the legislation and then leave the building.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) speaks to a reporter on Capitol Hill on March 16. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n“We are going to need a little better medical advice on this than we have right now,” Blunt told reporters, adding that he has not been given a recent update from the Office of the Attending Physician, which handles lawmakers’ health care. “I think we need more information before we can comment knowledgeably.”\n\nSen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said it was “concerning that we have two House members and one senator already testing positive.”\n\nBut he noted that the Capitol has been closed to the general public and that many congressional staffers have been sent home amid the pandemic.\n\n“There’s virtually no one here in the Capitol except for key and critical senior staff,” Coons told CNN in an interview Sunday afternoon.\n\nPaul took part in Friday’s Senate Republican luncheon at the Capitol. He was the lone senator to vote “no” earlier this month on an $8.3 billion emergency spending measure to fight the outbreak and on Wednesday was among eight senators to vote against a relief package that ensures paid leave to many Americans.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican, who is a frequent critic of federal spending, said in a floor speech Wednesday that he objected to the legislation’s price tag and the impact it would have on the federal debt.\n\n“The history of pandemics indicates a strong likelihood that the peak of infections and mortality could pass in a few weeks to a few months,” Paul said. “Congress should remain calm and try not to explode the debt in our response.”\n\nHe also sought to strike a positive tone in addressing the crisis facing the nation.\n\n“Reports indicate that scientists will likely set a speed record in developing a vaccine,” Paul said. “Now is not the time for malaise. Now is the time for optimism.”\n\nWhile Paul is the first senator to test positive, several other senators have announced in recent weeks that they are self-quarantining after having contact with individuals who tested positive.\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Her statement was carried by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nKim Yo Jong said Trump explained in the letter “his plan to propel the relations between the two countries of the DPRK,” a reference to the country’s formal name of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nThe U.S. president also explained “his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work,” the report said, quoting Trump as saying he was “impressed by the efforts made by the chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic.”\n\nTrump’s letter was “consistent with his efforts to engage global leaders during the ongoing pandemic,” said a senior Trump administration official, who spoke the condition of anonymity. “The President looks forward to continued communications with Chairman Kim.”\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak in neighboring China in January, North Korea has not reported a single case of the virus. The isolated country has adopted stringent quarantine measures against the virus, calling it a matter of “national survival.”\n\nKim’s sister, however, warned against making “hasty conclusions” about the good personal relationship between the two leaders. “I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice is ensured between the two countries, not merely by the personal letter between the two leaders,” Kim Yo Jong said in her statement.\n\nDuyeon Kim, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, said the response is North Korea’s way of saying it still wants a better offer at the negotiating table.\n\n“North Korea is warning that they won’t be fooled by niceties or U.S. tactics and that the U.S. needs to do better,” she said, adding that the North Korean leader’s sister is “making it clear that Pyongyang will continue with nuclear weapons development.”\n\nThis is the second known correspondence this year between Trump and Kim after Trump sent birthday greetings in January.\n\nKim Kye Gwan, adviser to North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, downplayed the diplomatic significance of the letter at the time, saying such personal exchanges between the leaders were not enough to draw Pyongyang back into nuclear talks.\n\nNegotiations between the two countries over denuclearization of North Korea have been stalled since a summit meeting in February 2019 collapsed over the North’s demands of sanctions relief in exchange for partial disarmament steps.\n\nTrump had a brief encounter with Kim at a border town between the South and North in June. The two leaders at the time touted “a very good relationship,” which failed to produce concrete progress in disarmament as North Korea resumed weapons tests within a month.\n\nOn the day the Korean Central News Agency reported on Trump’s letter, the state media outlet also said Kim guided a successful test of “tactical guided missiles” the previous day.\n\n“The timing almost certainly was carefully calibrated, possibly to underscore North Korea’s message that it remains skeptical about the prospects of improved U.S.-DPRK ties,” analyst Rachel Minyoung Lee wrote on the NK Pro website.\n\nJohn Hudson contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-20", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

The federal aid would help Boeing pay suppliers “to maintain the health of the supply chain,” the company said.\n\n“We appreciate the support of the President and the Administration for the 2.5 million jobs and 17,000 suppliers that Boeing relies on to remain the number one US exporter, and we look forward to working with the Administration and Congress as they consider legislation and the appropriate policies,” Gordon Johndroe, vice president of communications at Boeing, said in a statement sent to reporters.\n\nThe aerospace industry was not mentioned in a massive economic stimulus bill introduced by Senate Republicans on Thursday, which includes $50 billion in “loans and loan guarantees” for passenger airlines; $8 billion for “cargo air carriers”; and $150 billion for other “eligible businesses,” a category administration officials have suggested could include the hotel and cruise industries.\n\nBoeing’s request for governmental help comes as  global air traffic is expected to decline and airline customers plan to push off new orders of jets. On March 13, the company drew out the full amount of its $13.8 billion private loan, citing concerns about whether it would have access to cash should the markets worsen. It also halted new hires.\n\nAlthough Boeing’s size has allowed it to absorb historic losses for the time being, some of the company’s suppliers have been forced to lay off employees. Spirit AeroSystems, among Boeing’s most vulnerable suppliers, is relying on Boeing to keep buying fuselages and other raw materials for the Max even though Boeing’s production lines are paused.\n\nThe company’s stock price dropped 36 percent last week, closing at $95 per share Friday. Even with uncertainty created by the grounding of its flagship 737 Max jet, the company’s stock was trading above $340 per share about five weeks ago. \n\nHaley joined Boeing’s board a year ago, just after the second crash of a Max jet sent the company into a crisis. Before joining the board, she had opposed efforts by Boeing employees to unionize in South Carolina when she was governor of the state.\n\nBoeing’s board has been criticized for not providing enough independent oversight of the company’s leadership. Last year, responding to these concerns, the company established an independent board chairman with more authority over Boeing’s chief executive. Two months later, the board pushed out CEO Dennis Muilenburg and replaced him with the chairman, David Calhoun.\n\nJeff Stein and Aaron Gregg contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident":

Fortunately, we are a “free” people and can begin anew on a different path more relevant to the current circumstances. \n\nAn investment-based economy is its own reward, as we are now discovering. The larger the entity, the less flexible it is to the unforeseen. I don’t see the logic in assisting the airlines while we are still woefully behind in addressing our current condition. \n\nDerek T. Havens, Mason Neck\n\nThe Treasury Department extended the deadline for most individuals to pay taxes without penalty or interest by 90 days but just Friday extended the tax filing deadline. This was a good decision.  \n\nMillions of taxpayers have their tax returns prepared for free by Internal Revenue Service-certified volunteers under programs run by AARP, cities, counties and other nonprofit groups. (I have volunteered in two of these programs for the past six years.) Frequently, the clients are low-income taxpayers who can qualify for the earned-income tax credit and other income-support credits if they have competent tax help. AARP’s national program and virtually all other regional and local volunteer tax assistance programs have been shut down because of the coronavirus. Millions of taxpayers who rely on these free services will be unable to file their tax returns competently, if at all, by April 15. At least some of these programs might be able to restart and help otherwise vulnerable taxpayers.\n\nBecause the federal government is waiving interest and penalties on amounts owed by most taxpayers for 90 days beyond April 15, there is no harm to the government to have extended the filing deadline.\n\nJeffrey Komarow, Bethesda\n\nWould someone please explain how giving $1,000 to every American adult would reduce the expected 20 percent unemployment rate in any meaningful fashion [“Proposal to send $1,000 checks gains momentum,” news, March 18]? Giving big wads of cash to those who are employed mostly would go into savings and not cause stores, restaurants and theaters to reopen. Instead, the rescue plan should be targeted to give much more than $1,000 each to the workers and small-business owners who may lose a third of a year’s income or more. We should provide emergency small-business loans at zero percent interest and send out unemployment insurance checks with no waiting periods, in larger amounts and with more flexible qualification guidelines.\n\n  Peter Werwath, Bucifield, Maine\n\nIf hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money are given to airlines, hotels, etc., to help stabilize the economy during the virus pandemic, I hope the industries are required to repay the money before their chief executives and board members pay themselves multimillion-dollar bonuses and pay nice dividends to shareholders. This should not be a taxpayer grant to the wealthy.\n\nSheldon Cheney, Keedysville\n\nCathy Merrill’s March 19 Thursday Opinion essay, “A death sentence for small business,” suggested that mandatory closures because of covid-19 be reexamined every two weeks as new data comes in. That is reasonable — but only after we have widespread testing in place. We are weeks and weeks behind because of the Trump administration’s initial inaction, as well as lying by Chinese officials. We have little control over China’s perfidy, but come November, citizens can render judgment on the administration’s track record.\n\nMartin Lawson, Fort Valley, Va.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13", "parent": null}, "score": 0.17, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": false, "id": "IAB13-10", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13-10", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13"}, "score": 0.14, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "04019000", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/04019000", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/04000000"}, "score": 0.12, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 3520, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[887, 890], [1172, 1175]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/AARP"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "AARP", "types": ["Organisation", "Agent"]}, {"indices": [[2544, 2548]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maine"}, "score": 0.9996913075447083, "text": "Maine", "types": ["State", "AdministrativeRegion", "Location", "PopulatedPlace", "Place", "Region", "Settlement"]}, {"indices": [[3036, 3049]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Small_business"}, "score": 0.9961653351783752, "text": "small business", "types": ["PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[1889, 1900], [2393, 2404]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unemployment"}, "score": 0.999589204788208, "text": "unemployment", "types": ["PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[3393, 3399]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perfidy"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "perfidy", "types": ["Form"]}, {"indices": [[1095, 1104]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tax_credit"}, "score": 0.9995539784431458, "text": "tax credit", "types": ["Incentive"]}, {"indices": [[420, 424]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logic"}, "score": 0.9918774366378784, "text": "logic", "types": ["Branch", "MusicGenre", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[2393, 2414]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unemployment_benefits"}, "score": 0.9972282648086548, "text": "unemployment insurance", "types": ["Payments", "Company"]}, {"indices": [[3277, 3296]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump"}, "score": 0.9938113689422607, "text": "Trump administration", "types": ["Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[920, 928]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nonprofit_organization"}, "score": 0.9978472590446472, "text": "nonprofit", "types": ["MusicGenre", "Organization", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[1771, 1778]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bethesda,_Maryland"}, "score": 0.9175416827201843, "text": "Bethesda", "types": ["Location", "PopulatedPlace", "Place", "City", "Settlement"]}, {"indices": [[3338, 3344]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/China"}, "score": 0.8412725925445557, "text": "Chinese", "types": ["State", "Location", "Country", "PopulatedPlace", "Place"]}, {"indices": [[3385, 3389]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/China"}, "score": 0.9980103373527527, "text": "China", "types": ["State", "Location", "Country", "PopulatedPlace", "Place"]}, {"indices": [[2682, 2686]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virus"}, "score": 0.991032063961029, "text": "virus", "types": ["Agent", "Species", "Animal"]}, {"indices": [[3504, 3514]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fort_Valley,_Georgia"}, "score": 0.9820013642311096, "text": "Fort Valley", "types": ["Location", "PopulatedPlace", "Place", "City", "Settlement"]}, {"indices": [[559, 577]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury"}, "score": 0.999607503414154, "text": "Treasury Department", "types": ["Organisation", "Department", "Agent", "GovernmentAgency", "Settlement"]}, {"indices": [[2688, 2695]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandemic"}, "score": 0.9952334761619568, "text": "pandemic", "types": ["Arachnid", "Epidemic"]}, {"indices": [[1308, 1318]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "coronavirus", "types": ["Eukaryote", "Species"]}, {"indices": [[3517, 3518]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Va", "types": ["Place"]}, {"indices": [[526, 540]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Derek T.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1074056, "name": "Danielle Douglas-gabriel"}, "body": "For at least 60 days, the 42 million Americans holding $1.5 trillion in federal student debt can ask their loan servicer to temporarily postpone their payments. Anyone more than 31 days behind on their bill as of March 13, or who becomes that delinquent, will have their payments automatically suspended.\n\nAll federal student borrowers, regardless of whether they choose to postpone their payments, will automatically have the interest on their loans set at zero for at least 60 days. The new interest rate will be retroactive to March 13. Any payments borrowers make will go strictly to the principal of their loans once all interest accrued before March 13 is paid.\n\nPeople in public service jobs will have to think twice about postponing their payments. Opting out for two months will result in a longer path to debt cancellation for those working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The federal program cancels the remaining balance of a borrower’s debt after 120 on-time monthly payments, but postponing the bill will lengthen the process.\n\n“We do not want COVID-19 disruptions to penalize borrowers who are on a pathway towards [Public Service Loan Forgiveness] or [Income-based] forgiveness. But it’s pretty clear that the administration has gone as far as they can go, or are willing to go,” said Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “So our attention is now turning towards Congress for further student borrower help.”\n\nThe Education Department’s announcement comes a day after congressional Democrats and Republicans issued competing student loan relief proposals.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a stimulus package Thursday that would halt all payments on student loans for three months, with an additional three-month suspension at the secretary’s discretion. The proposal would also ensure that students would not be forced to repay their federal loans if they leave school in the middle of the semester because of the coronavirus.\n\n“This is a smart emergency policy that avoids blanket student loan forgiveness,” said Lindsey Burke, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “Large-scale student loan forgiveness would be inappropriate and would place an additional burden on those who did not take out loans — the vast majority of taxpayers.”\n\nBurke, like other conservative higher education experts, takes a dim view of Senate Democrats’ proposal of at least $10,000 in tax-free debt cancellation for all federal student loan borrowers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) floated the idea Thursday as part of a host of measures to help borrowers. Senate Democrats want the Education Department to assume loan payments for the duration of the national emergency and then institute a three-month grace period during which borrowers can forgo their payments without penalty. Payments made by the agency would still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in public service jobs.\n\nTwenty civil rights, consumer and student groups have touted the Democrats’ proposal as a more forceful response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and one that could deliver a much-needed stimulus. The liberal coalition, which includes the American Federation of Teachers, Demos and Americans for Financial Reform, estimates as many as 1 in 3 student loan borrowers will have their debts canceled under the proposal.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-3", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 952969, "name": "Jacob Bogage"}, "body": "Walmart, which just paid fourth quarter bonuses on Thursday, is issuing the first quarter payouts as though it had reached sales goals for the three-month period ending in April. Employees are set to see heartier pay stubs on April 2, April 30 and May 28, when another regularly scheduled bonus payday is set.\n\n“Walmart associates have gone above and beyond the call of duty in serving our customers during these unprecedented times,” CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. “We want to reward our associates for their hard work and recognize them for the work that is in front of us.”\n\nMany large retailers, including Macy’s, Nordstrom and Apple have closed their brick and mortar locations as consumers follow public health recommendations and “social distancing” protocols to stem the virus’s spread. Walmart has stayed open, though at reduced hours, to allow staff to replenish inventory and do more extensive cleaning. Business has been brisk as shoppers pile cleaning supplies, toilet paper, food and other essentials into their carts. \n\nOn Wednesday, the company announced U.S. stores would open from 7 a.m., to 8:30 p.m. It designated a special shopping hour for customers older than 60 — who are at an elevated risk if they contract the virus — on Tuesday mornings beginning on March 24. They will be allowed to shop an hour before the location’s designated opening time.\n\nIt also set buying limits on paper products, milk, eggs, cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer, water, diapers, wipes, formula and baby food.\n\nThat’s little respite for many employees, though, who in some cases have been working through the night to sanitize the stores and restock shelves. Reinforcements may be on the way with the planned 150,000 new hires. Walmart said it would cut its two-week hiring process down to 24 hours through an online portal. It contacted “industry groups representing restaurants and hospitality,” according to the company’s statement, to offer employment opportunities to workers that lost their jobs because of the covid 19 crisis.\n\nRestaurants all over the country have been forced to close because of public health orders, but in some jurisdictions were allowed to continue running a carryout-only business. Travel and hospitality sectors are beginning to see large-scale job casualties as demand for airfare and lodging craters. Manufacturing has been hit hard, too, with major automakers idling North American plants over fears the virus could spread and a looming recession that will likely soften consumer demand.\n\n“We know millions of Americans who are usually employed at this time are temporarily out of work, and at the same time we’re currently seeing strong demand in our stores,” McMillon said in the statement. “We’re looking for people who see Walmart as a chance to earn some extra money and perform a vital service to their community.”\n\nEarlier this month, Walmart waived its worker attendance policy through the end of April for employees that felt unable or unsafe to come to work. Employees in mandated quarantine zones can receive two weeks of paid leave that will not count against vacation or other leave time. Infected employees will receive two weeks of paid time off, and are eligible for another 26 weeks of fully- or partially-paid leave.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB22-4", "level": 2,

They contributed to championships here at Maryland, and those memories will last a lifetime.”\n\nAustin’s departure is a significant blow to Maryland, which ended its shortened season with a Big Ten tournament championship this month. The sophomore from Virginia gave the Terps a significant height advantage against most Big Ten teams and averaged 12 points and 6.8 rebounds per game, second on the team in both categories. Owens, who played behind Austin, redshirted this year after a bout of mononucleosis in the fall.\n\nJust as meaningful is that Austin’s and Owens’ departures leave Maryland with only eight roster players for the 2020-21 season — just as it finally looked like the Terps had rebounded from a rash of transfers in 2017 that left the roster undermanned.\n\nSophomore guard Taylor Mikesell will be the lone full-time returning starter, although freshman point guard Ashley Owusu started 16 games, most of which were non-conference contests at the start of the season. Junior point guard Channise Lewis, who missed the entire year after tearing the lateral meniscus in her left knee during the preseason, will be the team’s only senior.\n\nFrese adds just one new player next year in 6-foot-3 forward Angel Reese. The Baltimore native is the No. 2 overall player in the Class of 2020, per ESPN, but was the only player to sign with Maryland in an uncharacteristically small recruiting class for Frese.\n\nSophomore forward Mimi Collins, a transfer from Tennessee, and freshman guard Zoe Young will also suit up for the Terps next season after both sat out this year. Collins decided to take a redshirt year to better learn Maryland’s system, and Young suffered a torn ACL before the season began.\n\nThe timing of Austin’s and Owen’s departures makes finding a transfer player this spring to help bolster the roster more difficult than usual. The NCAA froze all in-person recruiting until at least April 15 because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, meaning Frese can contact any potential transfers on the market via text, email or phone call but Maryland can’t host players on campus or make in-home visits.\n\nEven if the in-person recruiting ban lifts after April 15, Frese made the point over the weekend that coaches don’t know what campus visits will look like if students don’t come back to school after spring break.\n\nMaryland announced Thursday that all undergraduate classes will be conducted online through the end of the semester.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB17", "parent": null}, "score": 0.28,

Public Schools and is on spring brake this week, sits by the Tidal Basin and works on a sketch of the cherry blossoms on Thursday. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \n  On an unseasonably warm Friday morning, the National Park Service announced that Washington’s cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin reached an unusually early peak bloom.\n The March 20th peak bloom is the earliest since 2012 (when it also occurred on March 20) and tied for the third earliest on record. In the Park Service’s 99-year record dating to 1921, the only years with earlier bloom dates were 1990 (March 15) and 2000 (March 17).\n Normally, the cherry blossoms attract 1.5 million visitors but much smaller numbers are anticipated this year.\n Because of the coronavirus, local officials are urging Tidal Basin visitors to maintain social distance or avoid the area altogether. A livestream of the Tidal Basin is available to see the blossoms remotely.\n [Can you safely visit the cherry blossoms amid the coronavirus crisis?]\n    The National Park Service displays all of the preventive measures on the sign near the Tidal Basin for the viewing of the cherry blossoms due to the coronavirus on March 19. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \n On Friday morning, as the blossoms hit peak, the livestream showed a steady flow of visitors but much lighter crowds than usual.\n The National Cherry Blossom Festival, which runs March 20 to April 12, cancelled all events including the April 4 parade.\n Abnormally warm weather during late winter and early spring propelled the blossoms to the early bloom, some 11 days ahead of the 30-year average of March and two weeks ahead of the longer-term (1921 to 2019) average of April 3.\n  By definition, peak bloom occurs when 70 percent of the cherry trees are flowering.\n Once peak bloom is reached, the blossom petals can remain for a week or so if it’s dry and winds are light. But in some years, petals have fallen off sooner because of wind, rain or frost.\n This year, the best blossom viewing is likely between Friday and Sunday although breezy conditions into the weekend may result in some loss of petals. On Saturday night, there’s an outside chance of frost, but temperatures should remain above freezing and the risk of damage or significant wilting is small.\n By Sunday night and Monday, steady rain is expected which may end the peak bloom period.\n Due to the unusual warmth, peak bloom occurred on the early side of predictions.\n The Capital Weather Gang had predicted peak bloom to occur between March 20 and 24 (a revision from an initial forecast of March 25 to 29). The National Park Service’s forecast for peak bloom was between March 21 and 24 (a revision from an initial forecast of March 27 to 30).", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB15-10", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB15-10", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB15"}, "score": 0.53, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "IAB15", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB15", "parent": null}, "score": 0.09, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "17003000", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/17003000", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/17000000"}, "score": 0.24, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 2773, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[141, 155], [304, 318], [661, 675], [995, 1009], [1167, 1181]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cherry_blossom"}, "score": 0.8094363212585449, "text": "cherry blossoms", "types": ["Flower", "Plant"]}, {"indices": [[1502, 1507]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parade"}, "score": 0.9747456312179565, "text": "parade", "types": ["Holiday", "Procession", "MusicGenre"]}, {"indices": [[895, 904], [1307, 1316]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Streaming_media"}, "score": 0.6809674501419067, "text": "livestream", "types": ["Multimedia", "MusicGenre", "Work", "Product"]}, {"indices": [[100, 110], [327, 337], [814, 824], [913, 923], [1132, 1142]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tidal_Basin"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "Tidal Basin", "types": ["BodyOfWater", "Lake", "Part", "Location", "NaturalPlace", "Place", "Person"]}, {"indices": [[190, 199], [291, 300], [1239, 1248]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington_(state)"}, "score": 0.731511116027832, "text": "Washington", "types": ["State", "AdministrativeRegion", "Location", "PopulatedPlace", "Place", "Region", "Settlement"]}, {"indices": [[0, 7]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_(Australia)"}, "score": 0.9598995447158813, "text": "Victoria", "types": ["State", "AdministrativeRegion", "Location", "PopulatedPlace", "Place", "Region"]}, {"indices": [[186, 204], [1235, 1253]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Washington_Post"}, "score": 0.999978244304657, "text": "The Washington Post", "types": ["WrittenWork", "Product", "PeriodicalLiterature", "Newspaper", "Work", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[141, 146], [304, 309], [661, 666], [995, 1000], [1167, 1172], [1797, 1802]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cherry"}, "score": 0.9794252514839172, "text": "cherry", "types": ["Fruit", "Plant"]}, {"indices": [[2008, 2012], [2215, 2219]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frost"}, "score": 0.9991041421890259, "text": "frost", "types": ["Company", "Coating"]}, {"indices": [[254, 274], [1049, 1069], [2641, 2661]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Park_Service"}, "score": 0.9999703764915466, "text": "National Park Service", "types": ["Organisation", "Agency", "Agent", "GovernmentAgency"]}, {"indices": [[366, 369], [394, 397], [1297, 1300], [1756, 1759], [1831, 1834], [2395, 2398], [2442, 2445], [2536, 2539], [2678, 2681]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Summit"}, "score": 0.8302974104881287, "text": "peak", "types": ["Point", "Place"]}, {"indices": [[171, 184], [1220, 1233]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McDonnell"}, "score": 0.9702525734901428, "text": "John McDonnell", "types": ["Politician", "Person", "MemberOfParliament", "Agent", "OfficeHolder"]}, {"indices": [[71, 75]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brake"}, "score": 0.996917724609375, "text": "brake", "types": ["Device", "Product"]}, {"indices": [[774, 784], [1020, 1030], [1194, 1204]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "coronavirus", "types": ["Eukaryote", "Species"]}, {"indices": [[1392, 1423]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Cherry_Blossom_Festival"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "National Cherry Blossom Festival", "types": ["Holiday", "Celebration"]}, {"indices": [[0, 17]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Victoria Stevenson", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[647, 654]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Normally", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[34, 52]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "D.C.

However, the World Health Organization said there is no data currently to back that up and has not recommended that people stop using NSAIDs.\n\nBefore this latest surge, demand already was high as consumers stocked up on the drug ahead of potential quarantines.\n\nJJ is not experiencing any shortages of its raw materials for Tylenol, and it has taken steps including adding crews and increasing the use of equipment and capacity in plants in Puerto Rico and Pennsylvania where the drug is produced.\n\nU.S. long-term mortgage rates climbed this week in a whipsawing market amid deepening anxiety over devastation to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. Home loan rates had hit all-time lows two weeks ago. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average rate on the benchmark 30-year loan jumped to 3.65 percent this week from 3.36 percent last week. Freddie Mac said the short-term rise was due to mortgage lenders increasing prices to deal with booming demand for refinancing into loans at historically low rates.\n\nBritain's Burberry said sales in the final weeks of March would plunge by up to 80 percent as the impact of the coronavirus already seen in China spread to Europe and the United States, causing stores to close and luxury shopping to dry up.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2339978, "name": "Cathy Merrill"}, "body": "May 15 is eight weeks away. How many of the officials setting emergency policy have ever run a small business? Very few, I suspect. To be clear: Two months is not a hiatus; it is a death sentence for small business.\n\nHow can the government help? Each emergency-related decision needs to be revisited in shorter and predictable periods of time as the science dictates. Mass testing for coronavirus will become available. We need to calibrate for the facts as they develop.\n\nLet’s all keep social distancing, as the experts say it will reduce spread, but let’s revisit curfews and gathering restrictions in two-week segments. Give us businesses hope that we might reopen before May 15. Give parents hope that their children will go back to school before the end of the academic year. Parents of the 22 million children who receive free and reduced-price lunches could particularly use that hope. It might be illusory, but maybe not. (Remember, social distancing is supposed to work.) Americans can do anything for a week or two, but 60 days is a lifetime. Businesses will go under, and kids will go on unsanctioned play dates. And let’s not even talk about teens and young adults who are supposed to forgo social life and dating for that long.\n\nThe math is simple. There are roughly 30 million small businesses (firms with fewer than 500 employees) in the United States, representing 49 percent of private-sector jobs. Most businesses — big and small — have a profit margin of roughly 10 percent to 20 percent (if they are lucky). A two-month hiatus means their profit is gone for the year. So, say we aim to break even. But to break even, we must rebound fully after the two-month “hiatus.” Who believes that will happen? None of my small-business CEO friends.\n\nSo now we are faced with a loss. What to do? Take a small-business loan? Why would I create more debt in uncertain times? Think about it: For restaurant owners, the biggest expense after employees is rent. Are they going to borrow money so they can just pay the landlord? Why not close shop and declare bankruptcy? Maybe start again with a much lower lease if the economy revs back up a year from now. If you are near retirement or near the end of your lease, this decision is easier: Quit now while you still have a little cash left. Layoffs, which are already happening, will be enormous and widespread by the beginning of next week. Bankruptcies are certain to follow.\n\nAs Elon Musk told Tesla employees, coronavirus panic is worse than the virus itself. Virus infections can at least, eventually, be quantified. But who is going to quantify the number of deaths from unemployment stress, food insecurity, depression or lost health insurance — plus the spike in suicide rates and heart angina from the stress of being laid off or furloughed?\n\nWithout fast action, our country is going to experience record unemployment levels, possibly higher than even those in the Great Depression. Government needs to act quickly, but it also needs to be able to revise quickly. Set policies, and then amend as conditions warrant. The notion that the nation will be able to freeze small business in place for two months and restart it with ease is preposterous.\n\nWhile I believe that the United States has the smartest scientists in the world, I don’t believe anyone can predict where the country will be 60 days from now. Let’s not try. Let’s leave the door open to revise policy and loosen restrictions.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2337689, "name": "Cathy Merrill"}, "body": "May 15 is eight weeks away. How many of the officials setting emergency policy have ever run a small business? Very few, I suspect. To be clear: Two months is not a hiatus; it is a death sentence for small business.\n\nHow can the government help? Each emergency-related decision needs to be revisited in shorter and predictable periods of time as the science dictates. Mass testing for coronavirus will become available. We need to calibrate for the facts as they develop.\n\nLet’s all keep social distancing, as the experts say it will reduce spread, but let’s revisit curfews and gathering restrictions in two-week segments. Give us businesses hope that we might reopen before May 15. Give parents hope that their children will go back to school before the end of the academic year. Parents of the 22 million children who receive free and reduced-price lunches could particularly use that hope. It might be illusory, but maybe not. (Remember, social distancing is supposed to work.) Americans can do anything for a week or two, but 60 days is a lifetime. Businesses will go under, and kids will go on unsanctioned play dates. And let’s not even talk about teens and young adults who are supposed to forgo social life and dating for that long.\n\nThe math is simple. There are roughly 30 million small businesses (firms with fewer than 500 employees) in the United States, representing 49 percent of private-sector jobs. Most businesses — big and small — have a profit margin of roughly 10 percent to 20 percent (if they are lucky). A two-month hiatus means their profit is gone for the year. So, say we aim to break even. But to break even, we must rebound fully after the two-month “hiatus.” Who believes that will happen? None of my small-business CEO friends.\n\nSo now we are faced with a loss. What to do? Take a small-business loan? Why would I create more debt in uncertain times? Think about it: For restaurant owners, the biggest expense after employees is rent. Are they going to borrow money so they can just pay the landlord? Why not close shop and declare bankruptcy? Maybe start again with a much lower lease if the economy revs back up a year from now. If you are near retirement or near the end of your lease, this decision is easier: Quit now while you still have a little cash left. Layoffs, which are already happening, will be enormous and widespread by the beginning of next week. Bankruptcies are certain to follow.\n\nAs Elon Musk told Tesla employees, coronavirus panic is worse than the virus itself. Virus infections can at least, eventually, be quantified. But who is going to quantify the number of deaths from unemployment stress, food insecurity, depression or lost health insurance — plus the spike in suicide rates and heart angina from the stress of being laid off or furloughed?\n\nWithout fast action, our country is going to experience record unemployment levels, possibly higher than even those in the Great Depression. Government needs to act quickly, but it also needs to be able to revise quickly. Set policies, and then amend as conditions warrant. The notion that the nation will be able to freeze small business in place for two months and restart it with ease is preposterous.\n\nWhile I believe that the United States has the smartest scientists in the world, I don’t believe anyone can predict where the country will be 60 days from now. Let’s not try. Let’s leave the door open to revise policy and loosen restrictions.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1689405, "name": "Alex Webb"}, "body": "AMS, which makes laser components for the iPhone’s facial recognition system, is midway through an effort to sell 1.7 billion euros of new shares in a rights offer to pay for Osram. It will be tough to fund the whole deal ultimately with debt. When the terms of the share sale were announced a week ago, the price of the new stock was set at 9.20 Swiss francs.\n\nThat was a 64% discount to the then share price, which had long been anticipating the fundraising. Coronavirus was no secret at the time and markets were already falling, and these wide terms seemed to acknowledge as much.\n\nSince then, however, AMS shares have continued their downward trajectory, and were trading below 9 francs on Wednesday. Investors are now being asked to buy AMS shares above the market price to clinch a risky takeover in challenging times. It’s hard to see them being keen. No wonder Osram shareholders are getting worried AMS will not fulfill its bid – the German firm’s shares have also fallen sharply.\n\nNormally, AMS would be able to count on the banks underwriting the share offer – HSBC Holdings Plc. and UBS Group AG – to buy any stock not taken by investors. The snag is that the underwriting agreement includes a so-called material adverse change clause, which allows the banks to walk away in the case of any “calamity or crisis or development involving a prospective change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions in any country”.\n\nThe markets see that as a get-out. The virus could detrimentally affect demand for the smartphones for which AMS supplies components, and the automotive industry – Munich-based Osram’s key end market.\n\nIt’s a highly uncertain situation. In a worst-case scenario the banks could be left holding roughly 70% of AMS, although they are likely to have passed on some of their commitment to hedge funds. Getting a controlling stake might even necessitate a mandatory takeover bid. The incentives for the banks to try wriggling off the hook are high.\n\nAMS can still fund the deal in the short term because it has bridge financing. But it will have to repay those loans before long. It’s not clear if AMS shareholders wouldn’t mind letting the deal fall apart. What’s not in doubt is that Osram and its shareholders would be furious if that happened, and would almost certainly chase AMS in the courts – there doesn’t seem to be a material adverse change clause in the actual takeover offer. Still, the bidder might prefer a legal battle to turning to the debt markets to pay for the transaction at considerably more cost.\n\nThe takeover battle itself was a drawn-out, messy affair. Its closing risks becoming messier still.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nAlex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe’s technology, media and communications industries.

Which puts the ball in Neumann’s court.\n\nThe $3 billion deal that the Japanese company says it could walk away from, because of the regulatory investigations, is just one part of a package totaling close to $8 billion put together to bail out the startup after its offering plans were scrapped and value massively written down. Among the items in its Oct. 23 funding announcement is the acceleration of an existing $1.5 billion commitment and over $5 billion in debt financing.(1) The tender offer for shares was a big deal because that’s what helped SoftBank boost its stake from 29% to 80%.\n\nIt also allowed SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son to install his own executive team at WeWork — Chairman Marcelo Claure is SoftBank’s chief operating officer —and start calling the shots on everything from  employee layoffs to  unwinding earlier acquisitions. \n\nIf the purchase of those existing shares doesn’t go through, then Neumann gets to hold on to his stake in a company worth pennies to the dollar of where it was a year ago. SoftBank may not even have control, limiting its ability to steer WeWork to profitability.\n\nBut SoftBank has to do something. Last week it announced plans to buy back $4.8 billion shares,  an opportunistic move aimed at propping up the stock and alleviating some of the pressure put on by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. That move spurred SP Global Ratings to put SoftBank on negative outlook, the first step before actually cutting its credit rating. Its stock dropped as much as 12%, taking the decline over the past month to more than 40%.\n\nAt the same time, the global economic meltdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has made the Vision Fund’s portfolio of unprofitable startups look shaky. These companies survive on continuous streams of cash until they can eventually turn a profit, and that lifeline may get cut in a credit crunch.\n\nWalking away from the tender offer is entirely possible. This would be the nuclear option in the sense that doing so amounts to mutually assured destruction.\n\nWithout purchasing that stake, SoftBank would be left sharing control with the same executive team and investors who oversaw WeWork’s early blunders — making it tough to effect the wholesale changes needed for a turnaround. Yet SoftBank has already plowed so much cash into the business that WeWork’s final demise would cause further pain not just to investors, but Son’s own reputation as a savvy and trustworthy investor.\n\nNeumann could hold his ground and insist on the originally agreed price. But these regulatory investigations seem targeted at him, and actions that took place under his watch, including concerns over self-dealings, disclosures and conflicts of interest. That gives SoftBank the opportunity to point the finger not only at Neumann but at existing shareholders who share the responsibility of not exercising enough oversight.\n\nThat means that if the tender offer does fail, SoftBank can put the blame on the counterparty with a reminder that there won’t be a better offer elsewhere. In the current meltdown, Son is in a position to show what it would look like if “We” are not in this together.\n\n(1) According to the statement, this funding is expected to occur after the completion of the tender offer.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Laura Kelly (D) announced at a news conference Tuesday in Topeka she was issuing an executive order to close all state-accredited schools — including public, private and parochial campuses, affecting almost 500,000 students — through the spring semester.\n\n“This was not an easy decision to make,” Kelly said. “It came after close consultation with the education professionals who represent local school boards, school administrators and local teachers. These unprecedented circumstances threaten the safety of our students and the professionals who work with them every day and we must respond accordingly.”\n\nKelly had earlier assigned the state Department of Education to convene experts to develop a comprehensive education plan for students for the rest of the year, but it is not known what it will look like for students who can’t take online classes and for those with special needs.\n\nNearly 41.5 million of the nearly 50.8 million public school students in the country have now seen their schools close in 39 states and the District of Columbia, according to an Education Week tally.\n\nStates around the country are struggling to figure out how they are going to educate students who are at home, many of whom do not have Internet access or technology. Another complexity is that federal law requires that districts ensure equitable education for students with special needs if alternative forms of education are being provided for other students.\n\nSchool closures have been coming fast and furious.\n\nIt was March 12 when Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) became the first state leader to close schools. At the time, it was for three weeks, but he has since said it could be for much longer, even through the end of the school year.\n\nOn Sunday in Texas, where some but not all districts have closed, Education Commissioner Mike Morath told superintendents that some students may not return to school for the rest of the academic year.\n\nThen on Monday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who initially resisted closing campuses, said it was possible schools in his city could be closed the rest of the school year — and maybe longer.\n\nOn Tuesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said at a news conference that nearly all public schools in the state have closed and that they are all likely to stay closed the rest of the school year.\n\n“I would plan and assume it is unlikely that many of these schools, few if any, will open before the summer break,” he said, KPBS reported.\n\nNewsom, a father of four, said when he went home Monday, his 6-year-old daughter, Brooklynn, was crying about schools being closed and being unable to see her friends.\n\n“I told her, ‘Honey, I don’t think the schools are going to open again,’ \" Newsom said. “If I can tell my daughter that and not tell your daughter … then I’m not being honest and true to the people of the state of California. Boy, I hope I’m wrong, but I believe that to be the case.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB5", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

So we’ll be helping Boeing.\"\n\nShortly after the president’s comments, Boeing published a statement saying there should be a minimum of $60 billion in “public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees” for the aerospace manufacturing industry. The details of a potential bailout have not been announced.\n\n“We appreciate the support of the President and the Administration for the 2.5 million jobs and 17,000 suppliers that Boeing relies on to remain the number one US exporter, and we look forward to working with the Administration and Congress as they consider legislation and the appropriate policies,” Gordon Johndroe, vice president of communications at Boeing, said in a statement sent to reporters.\n\n“Until global passenger traffic resumes to normal levels, these measures are needed to manage the pressure on the aviation sector and the economy as a whole,” Johndroe wrote.\n\nThe company confirmed Monday that it had been in discussions with “government leaders” about short-term access to public and private funds.\n\nBoeing’s request for public help underscores the dire financial straits the company finds itself in, as dual crises threaten to severely complicate its return to financial health. On March 13, the company drew out the full amount of its $13.8 billion private loan, citing concerns about whether it would have access to cash should the markets worsen. It also halted new hires.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and its related market volatility came at a time when Boeing’s business was already vulnerable. The company has struggled to convince regulators that the 737 Max ― the newest version of its best-selling jet ― is safe to fly after two deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed hundreds of people. After Boeing leadership admitted that the jet’s flight control systems played a role in both crashes, regulators have continued to find problems with the plane, repeatedly pushing back the jet’s recertification timeline. Boeing shut down its 737 Max production lines late last year after experiencing the toughest year in company history.\n\nBoeing has suffered along with the broader aviation industry as travel bans have slowed new bookings. Last week Goldman Sachs analysts predicted a 7 percent decline in air traffic this year that would prompt many airlines to defer purchases of new planes.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1037410, "name": "Dana Milbank"}, "body": "“We have to get rid of this, we have to win this war, and ideally quickly,” he said in the White House briefing room. “Because the longer it takes — it’s not a good situation. And I’m not even talking about the economy, I’m talking about the lives of a lot of people.”\n\nBut Trump’s late conversion to reality has left behind one group of Americans that will be difficult to convince: his own supporters. Their alternative-facts diet has left them intolerant of anything the government and the media feed them.\n\nAn alarming new poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist shows that the number of Republicans who believe the virus is a real threat has actually fallen over the past month, from 72 percent in February to just 40 percent now. A majority of Republicans now say the threat has been blown out of proportion — more than double the 23 percent who said so last month.\n\nNaturally, they’re not so inclined to cooperate with efforts to slow the virus’s spread. Only 30 percent of Republicans plan to avoid large gatherings (vs. 61 percent of Democrats), a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found just before Trump proposed such limits. Republicans were half as likely to say they were rescheduling travel and a third as likely to stop eating out at restaurants.\n\nKey Trump allies aren’t cooperating, either. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) recommended on Monday: “If you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.”\n\nAlso Monday, Ron Paul, the former presidential candidate and father of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said, “People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus ‘pandemic’ could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated.”\n\nThen there’s Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R), who tweeted (and later deleted) a photo of him and his children at a “packed” food hall (Trump expressed his disagreement); Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), tweeting a photo of a freshly poured Corona beer at a restaurant and the message “Be smart. Don’t Panic”; and former Milwaukee County, Wis., sheriff David Clarke, once considered for a senior Trump administration job, who speculated that George Soros may be behind the virus panic and suggested: “GO INTO THE STREETS FOLKS. Visit bars, restaurants, shopping malls … ”\n\nAfter weeks of false reassurances and disinformation, Trump abruptly shifted this week. At Tuesday’s briefing, he lavishly praised the government scientists and public health experts he had until lately been contradicting, and he celebrated recent bipartisanship. Though he let slip an occasional shot at Democrats and the media, he made the rare admission that “we’ve done a poor job in terms of press relationship.”\n\nFor once, he put his priority where it should be: on the human toll. “For the markets, for everything, it’s a very simple, very simple solution. We want to get rid of it. We want to have as few deaths as possible.”\n\nHe spoke to those inclined toward vacation travel: “I would recommend that they just enjoy their living room.”\n\nAnd he admonished those not following social-distancing guidelines: “I’m not happy with those people.”\n\nThere can be no doubt who “those people” are: Fox-News viewing Trump supporters who, until this week, had been encouraged to believe Trump’s claims that the virus was well under control.\n\nAt one point Tuesday, Fox News’s John Roberts asked Trump to move closer to the microphone so the “people at home” could hear him.\n\nHe’s got that right. After encouraging his Fox fan base for weeks to scoff at the virus, Trump now finds that his presidency, the U.S. economy and countless lives depend on him convincing them otherwise.", "categories":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1274752, "name": "Dave Sheinin"}, "body": "On Sunday, the CDC recommended halting public gatherings of more than 50 people, including sporting events, for eight weeks — which MLB cited in saying, “The opening of the 2020 regular season will be pushed back in accordance with that guidance.” \n\nCardinals pitcher Andrew Miller, a longtime union leader, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “It’s going to be a while, I think. I’ve heard June 1. I’ve heard Memorial Day. Some people think later than that. That discussion is going to be interesting.” \n\nThe new, though nebulous timeline — with the second week of May now representing a best-case scenario — makes it increasingly unlikely baseball can contest an entire, 162-game regular season in 2020.\n\nMLB officials “remain committed to playing as many games as possible when the season begins,” the league statement Monday.\n\nIt was only late last week that the NBA and NHL announced the suspension of their regular seasons, and MLB announced a delay of its own. All three leagues, however, initially took a more optimistic view as to the lengths of the stoppages — a view that appears to no longer apply.\n\nIn a memo sent to NHL players Monday, the league cited the CDC-recommended eight-week ban on large gatherings and proposed a best-case scenario of training camps reopening around late April and games resuming eventually. The NHL’s hope has been to still to play a full regular season, and award the Stanley Cup.\n\nFor now, the league said, all players, including those from foreign countries, can return home and must stay in self-quarantine until March 27. That’s a different directive than players received just days earlier, when the league asked players to remain close to where they play and self-quarantine.\n\nUnlike the NBA or NHL, baseball’s calendar is hemmed in by the winter weather in the northern half of the country, which would make it impossible to extend the postseason schedule deep into November or beyond — barring an unprecedented move to a neutral-site stadium with a dome or in a warmer climate.\n\nIn 1995, the last time Opening Day was delayed — in that case by a players’ strike that pushed the season’s start to late April — teams conducted a condensed, two-week spring training before launching into an abbreviated, 144-game season.\n\nThe main difference this time is that spring training was already well underway when the stoppage came, with pitchers well into their arm-strengthening buildup of innings. Baseball likely would need to conduct an abbreviated, “second” spring training for the sake of pitchers before its rescheduled Opening Day.\n\nOn Monday, players continued to depart MLB spring training camps, after MLB informed teams they were no longer allowed to organize workouts. The facilities will not be closed off to players, but they are being urged to stay away.\n\n“We’re really encouraging players to make a decision where they want to be over an extended period of time and get to that location as soon as possible,” Manfred told the Post-Dispatch.\n\nAccording to a memo union leadership sent to agents Monday, big league players who leave their camps will be eligible to receive a $1,100-per-week living allowance through the MLBPA until at least April 9.\n\nThe latest delay to the season leaves a cascade of issues for the league and the MLB Players Association to iron out, including player salaries for 2020, the accruing of service time, a temporary halting of roster moves and the conditions for the eventual resumption of play.\n\nBut all of those issues are secondary to the primary question for baseball, and for all sports: When will the games return?\n\nSamantha Pell contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17",

The site is capable of serving 500 athletes and coaches with more than 240 dorm rooms on site.\n\nSeveral U.S. Olympic teams utilize the space on a permanent or regular basis, including boxing, cycling, shooting and wrestling, and while the center serves as a permanent training home for many U.S. competitors, it also hosts athletes from other countries. According to the letter sent to athletes, anyone using the facility on a short-term basis can remain on-site for the remainder of their program, but no new athletes will be permitted.\n\n“Despite the ever-changing nature of coronavirus, its global impact, and the hypothetical scenarios that have entered the conversation, the USOPC has not been given any information to suggest that the Tokyo 2020 Games will not go ahead as scheduled and as planned,” USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a separate letter to athletes Friday. “We, like the athletes who are training to compete at their very best in Tokyo, are focused on being prepared to support our Olympic and Paralympic teams in Japan.”\n\nIn other Olympics news Monday, USA Wrestling announced it will discontinue all sanctioned events through April 6, including the Last Chance Olympic Trials Qualifier in Millersville, Pa., on March 27-28, and the 2020 Olympic Team Trials schedule for State College, Pa., April 4-5.\n\nIn addition, USA Wrestling strongly encouraged all chartered clubs and coaches to follow the guidelines and recommendations of their local government or school district in deciding whether to host practices. The organization further urged those clubs to require all participants to have their temperature taken and bar the participation of anyone with a reading of 100.4 or higher. Moreover, it discouraged the participation of anyone showing signs or symptoms of a respiratory illness, regardless of their temperature.\n\nAlso, the International Olympic Committee’s Boxing Task Force on Monday announced it would suspend its “Road to Tokyo” European qualifier in London, which had gotten underway March 14 and was scheduled to run through March 24. \n\nThe decision to halt the event mid-stream was made to enable participating athletes from more than 60 countries to return home amid increasing global travel restrictions and quarantine measures, the federation explained. \n\nWith International Olympic officials insisted that the 2020 Games will be held, the boxing federation task force said it hopes to complete the process for qualifying boxers in May and June.\n\nIn addition, boxing officials canceled the Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament, scheduled to take place in Buenos Aires from March 26-April 3, and the World Olympic Qualifying Tournament scheduled in Paris from May 13-24.\n\nHirshland also announced that all Team USA fan events would be canceled through April, including next month’s “100 day out” celebration in New York. Earlier, the USOPC canceled its media summit, which had been scheduled for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nIn its letter Monday, the training center also asked athletes to take their temperature twice daily and to consult medical staff if their temperate reaches 100.4 degrees.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-23", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

That hiatus, which was set to run through April 11, has been effectively extended to May 15 in light of the CDC’s recommendation.\n\nThat extension has wide-reaching ramifications for individual NBA teams, which were awaiting guidance from the league office on next steps. Before the coronavirus crisis, non-playoff teams anticipated that their seasons would end April 15. The two-month stoppage theoretically would have required teams to keep their players in town for a month past the standard conclusion of the regular season without any guarantee that games would be able to resume, with or without fans in attendance.\n\nMost NBA players had returned to their teams’ home cities but have family and other obligations elsewhere. NBA teams had been advised to hold individual workouts rather than team practices, which had left players in professional limbo and could have kept them away from their families for at least two months. In response to those concerns, the NBA sent a memo Sunday indicating that players could beginning traveling away from their team’s home market Monday as long as they remained in contact with their teams. The Athletic first reported the memo.\n\nThese complexities led two high-ranking team executives, who both spoke on the condition of anonymity, to predict that the NBA would be forced to cancel the balance of the regular season and drastically alter the draft combine, set for May 21-24 in Chicago.\n\nIn a sign of how quickly the coronavirus crisis has evolved, Silver floated a possible four-week shutdown as recently as Thursday.\n\n“Even if we’re out for a month or out for six weeks, we could still restart the season,” Silver said in an interview with TNT. “It might mean that the Finals take place in late-July.”\n\nThat timeline would be rendered impossible by the CDC recommendations, which are meant to help in slowing the spread of the coronavirus by encouraging social distancing. Given these new challenges, multiple high-ranking executives said the league probably would turn its attention to salvaging its postseason.\n\nPotential measures to save the playoffs, some executives said, include pushing back the start date to June, playing games in empty arenas, eliminating extra rest days between games, cutting down the 16-team field or hosting a single-site tournament to reduce travel between multiple markets.\n\n“The playoffs,” one high-ranking team executive said, “are in jeopardy.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Urologists have long seen a spike in appointments for the surgery timed to the tournament’s tip off. Doctors generally prescribe 48 hours of bed rest after patients get snipped, a period a great number of men choose to spend on the couch or in bed watching hoops while hoping their brackets don’t get busted.\n\n“There are some men that specifically come in leading into March Madness because in their mind they say, ‘I’m going to spend the weekend watching basketball anyway. This will be great,’” said Brad Lerner, president of Chesapeake Urology and chief of urology at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. “We probably get more requests to do it around the March Madness weekends than around any other sporting event.”\n\nLerner said vasectomy appointments nearly double in March each year compared to the average month. Some patients instead choose to schedule the procedure around the Masters in April, golf’s first major tournament of the calendar, or to match up with big football weekends in the fall.\n\nOne of Lerner’s patients, Glenn Clark, began discussing a vasectomy with his wife a year ago after the birth of their second son. They went back and forth for a while, thinking about having one more child and hoping for a girl, when his wife made up her mind: She didn’t want to be pregnant again.\n\n“I told her then, 'This is going to sound corny, but a lot of guys have [vasectomies] done around the NCAA tournament, and I’ll do it then,” said Clark, a 36 year-old Baltimore sports radio host.\n\nHe also picked March 20 with the tournament in mind. His mother-in-law agreed to take his boys for the weekend, he said, and he used the upcoming surgery as a running bit on his radio program.\n\nAnd then the coronavirus hit. He said he’s lucky he has movies saved up on his DVR ready to go, and he’s considering binge-watching all 10 seasons of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” instead of the sports he planned to enjoy\n\nLerner said he has five operations scheduled for Friday — each procedure takes about 15 minutes — and none of the patients has yet canceled or rescheduled for next March.\n\n“That’d be a tough sell to your wife to say, ‘Honey, you need to use birth control for another year. I’m postponing my vasectomy for another year for the next NCAA tournament,'” Lerner said.\n\nCody Wills, an elementary special education teacher and basketball coach in Campbellsville, Ky., had his vasectomy set for March 18. He and his wife decided that with three daughters, ages 5, 3 and eight months, they didn’t want any more children.\n\nOther teachers and coaching buddies joked to him that if he had the surgery on the Wednesday before the tournament, he’d be out of school for two days and could take advantage of four straight days of basketball. He scheduled the appointment in February.\n\nBut ever since, said Wills, 28, he and his wife haven’t been so sure they don’t want one more child in a year or two. When NCAA President Mark Emmert canceled the tournament on Thursday, Wills said it felt like a sign that they needed more time to think about it.\n\nHe canceled his surgery that afternoon.",

On Friday, even the acclaimed Rose’s Luxury cast off its long-held no reservations policy to entice more customers through the door.\n\nBars, too, are staying open, though some special events, such as White Ford Bronco’s performance at 3 Stars Brewing on March 13, and the Sovereign’s fourth anniversary party on March 14, have been postponed or canceled.\n\nDC Brau is selling cans to go, but has closed its taproom.\n\nIf you’ve been following our running list of closing and cancellations, you know that just about every major museum, including the Smithsonian, the National Gallery of Art and the Phillips Collection, has closed or will close soon. Some places, however, are still welcoming visitors.\n\nNational Parks, including the memorials on the Mall, Theodore Roosevelt Island and Great Falls Park, are open as usual.\n\nThe Spy Museum is open as usual, though it has canceled all public events through April 1.\n\nThe Hillwood Museum will close to the public on March 16, but its landscaped gardens will remain open during regular hours as “a safe space of respite and rejuvenation for the community.”\n\nTudor Place remains open, though some events have been canceled.

Were they recently held by the sweaty palms of some other unwitting kindergartner whose uncle had a stopover in Wuhan, or perhaps Milan, and then Kirkland, Wash., thus completing a terrible chain to deliver a fatal dose of coronavirus to this dozy retiree in Tampa?\n\nI move back, put up my hands defensively.\n\n“Aww. Is it your back, again, Pops? I can jump up to you.”\n\n“No, it's not my back.” Always implying, this one. “My back is fine, strong as always. It’s like your mommy told you. We just shouldn’t get too huggy. There are germs around now.”\n\nAnd there are. Nobody knows how quickly these viral fleas jump from host to host, but from what I read, by the time I finish writing this, it is expected that several new nations will be in lockdown. My wife and I moved here to be “close to the kids,” the legal term that describes this phase of our generation’s migrant golden years. Being a part of their lives is pretty much what we have going for us now. And now we have to figure out how to extricate ourselves, at least for the time being. Which time could be … a long time.\n\nSo here we are in the spring of 2020, amid a pandemic out of a Stephen King novel that targets the elderly and the infirm, but mysteriously spares the young — who may be silent carriers.\n\nThose of us past our 65 die-by dates are now supposed to decide how much or how little we should quarantine ourselves from our kids’ lives. We oldies are supposed to quarantine ourselves, to sequester from children or the sick, to FaceTime each other, to stay away from families — and pretty much anyone else — until the tsunami recedes. Which could be, I don’t know, three months, six months, a year, more.\n\nBut it’s not because we want to avoid exposing our innocent infants to grown-up poxes but because the little critters could kill us. We're the prey in this streaming movie. The darling kids are the ones standing in a row, eyes glittering in the fields, children of the corona.\n\nThe subtleties of navigating possible self-quarantine depend as well on our conditions. If, in addition to being just old, we also have underlying problems, such as lowered immune systems, or certain cancers, or respiratory ailments, or hypertension — the list goes on and on — we are supposed to be more susceptible to the virus, and should wall ourselves off accordingly.\n\nSo we rely on our old standby, checking the condition of our conditions, asking which couples, parents, and extended family, are most susceptible? Is my autoimmune disease more susceptible than my wife’s hypertension? If so, do I have to stay alone at Easter while she bends the rules to hide the colored eggs? (Of course, she’ll vigorously wash her hands afterward.)\n\nMy wife and I have only a few years left before we become as hopelessly out of it as, say, elderly presidential candidates tend to be. Our granddaughters, ages 6 and 4, have only a few years left before they start to find us hopeless, before the eye-rolling begins.\n\nHow brief a time do we have? What a small crack of light, while they think you are interesting, care what you think, laugh at your granddad jokes. And, it has to be said, how impossibly, ridiculously adorable they are just now, with their ballet moves, and their stick-figure sketches, their lisps, their princess gowns, their one-act plays, their tumbles off the end of the sofa, and their upside-down sunglasses.\n\nWe’re supposed to give all that up, stay away, cue Netflix and chill down to safe, antiseptic isolation? To save our lives?\n\n“Okay, grab my neck, I’ll lift you. Let’s twirl.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6-6", "parent":

As of Thursday afternoon the NCAA had yet to make an announcement about whether the tournament will go on.\n\n“I understand and respect the conference’s decision to cancel this year’s Big Ten tournament,” Coach Mark Turgeon said in a statement. “The health and safety of our student-athletes and entire program is paramount. This is an unprecedented situation that is much bigger than basketball. I remain hopeful that a resolution will be found to provide our student-athletes with the opportunity to complete their season.\" \n\nBig Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said in Indianapolis that the conference will not crown a tournament champion and the tournament will not take place at a later date.\n\n“If I was a student-athlete, I would be irate if someone came and said, ‘You can’t play in a game,'” Warren said on the Big Ten Network. “That’s what makes them special. And that’s what I expect them to be, is that they want to play. That’s what makes competition, that’s what makes intercollegiate athletics so special. But at the end of the day, we have a responsibility to make sure we do the right thing.” \n\nWhen asked about the NCAA tournament, Warren said that decision-makers should “put the student-athletes at the epicenter of your decision.” \n\nLike many universities around the country, Maryland Athletics announced Wednesday that only players, coaches, essential personnel, media and family members of the athletes could attend all home events until at least April 10. Men’s lacrosse, women’s lacrosse, tennis and gymnastics all have events scheduled in College Park this weekend.\n\nThe athletic department also halted all out-of-season practice during the week of March 23, which includes the first week of spring football practice.\n\nUniversity of Maryland students are on spring break next week, but classes have also been canceled for the following week (March 23-27). Until April 10, classes will be online.\n\nThe Terrapins’ men’s basketball team earned a share of the conference title Sunday with their win over Michigan in the season finale. Even though spectators had already been barred from attending Big Ten tournament games beginning Thursday, Maryland parents had planned to attend.\n\nMaryland was supposed to practice at noon Thursday. Turgeon told the players in the locker room. The team will not practice Thursday, and everything beyond that remains uncertain.\n\nAnthony Cowan Jr.’s father said his son, the Terps’ senior point guard, felt dejected and confused upon hearing the news.\n\n“We’re not sure what happens next,” said the elder Anthony Cowan, who had a flight to Indianapolis scheduled for Friday at 6 a.m. The father added that he understood the importance of prioritizing the health of those involved.\n\nSome Maryland players expressed similar shock on social media. A Maryland media availability session scheduled for Thursday afternoon was canceled.\n\nThe NCAA announced Wednesday afternoon that the NCAA tournament would be played without fans and “with only essential staff and limited family attendance,” Mark Emmert, the organization’s president, said in a statement. But that was before announcements of cancellations began rolling out en masse. After Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for coronavirus, the NBA suspended its season and other leagues followed suit.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1,

About one-fifth of airport staff have returned to work.\n\n“We don’t have any concrete dates yet and are still waiting for further instructions from the city and the provincial governments,” he said.\n\nThe earliest flight available is one departing from Wuhan to Qingdao at 10:40 a.m. on March 29, run by low-cost carrier Beijing Capital Airlines — a subsidiary of the government-owned Hainan Airlines, according to a search by The Post on major flight booking sites including Ctrip and Alibaba-owned Fliggy.\n\nPassengers from Wuhan could also take connecting flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and several other cities.\n\n“The airport will make relevant arrangements and make the dates public as soon as we receive a notice from government authorities,” the airport manager said.\n\nBeijing Capital Airlines told Chinese media that March 29 remains a “tentative” date and would be subject to adjustments in accordance with the development of the epidemic.\n\nThe airport in Wuhan and those serving the wider Hubei province have been asked to get ready by next Monday for government assessment. A document issued by the Hubei Airports Group shows that the preparations in Wuhan kicked off on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier this week, a health expert with the country’s top panel on tackling the outbreak told the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily that Wuhan will likely see new infections drop to zero by the end of this month.\n\nThe number of new confirmed cases in China outside Hubei has remained in single digits for two weeks, with eight new infections recorded in Wuhan on Wednesday and seven elsewhere, according to the country’s National Health Commission.", "categories":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 952482, "name": "Editorial Board"}, "body": "The outbreak has produced its share of dubious distinctions, from China’s ham-handed early attempts at coverup to the test-kit fiasco at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fighting the pandemic will take years. There is, so far, no vaccine or antiviral, leaving many people feeling vulnerable. Science is long, hard work, not all moonshots and miracles. Reflecting the public anxiety, President Trump has repeatedly urged that a new vaccine be developed fast, even though it will take a year — and probably longer — to develop, test and manufacture.\n\nThe understandable dread about a spreading virus should not overshadow remarkable developments in the speed and transparency of biomedical science. Next-generation genetic sequencing has produced a sheaf of blueprints of the coronavirus makeup in record time. Over the past decade or so, such sequencing has become far cheaper and faster — a vital tool that wasn’t available, for example, when the HIV/AIDS pandemic began. Even when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus took off in 2002 and peaked in February 2003, the full genome wasn’t sequenced until April of that year. Now, just weeks after the coronavirus outbreak, there are 161 genomes posted in one database, the Global Initiative to Share All Influenza Data, or GISAID. These show where each virus sample came from over time and emerging mutations.\n\nIn another promising technology, researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health, including Jason McLellan at the University of Texas at Austin, used cyro-electron microscopy to create an image of the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to anchor itself on a human cell and penetrate it. Going after that spike in a vaccine or therapy might block the process of infection. Researchers constructed a three-dimensional structural map of the spike in just 12 days.\n\nYet another development has been a boom in “open” science. As Kai Kupferschmidt reported in Science, researchers traditionally kept their findings quiet, angling for publication in a prestigious and peer-reviewed journal, protective of their discovery and the credit for it. This hampered the response to outbreaks. Now, scientists from around the world, including China, are readily sharing their findings on biomedical preprint servers, bioRxiv and medRxiv, where the papers are not peer-reviewed but made available quickly. This has led to more collaboration across national boundaries than ever before, a necessity when fighting a disease that also leaps across national borders.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1183960, "name": "Kathleen Parker"}, "body": "If you’re over 60, which until now was the new 40, you should consider “social distancing.”\n\nFor something so potentially lethal, at least more than the usual flu but not as much as SARS or MERS, two other coronaviruses, hand-washing seems bland advice considering that people really ought to wash their hands frequently under any circumstances. An aunt of mine gave her nieces, nephews and cousins an early jump on obsessive-compulsive disorder with her greeting whenever we entered the house: “Go wash your hands,” she’d sweetly command. As such things go, I’ve become my aunt.\n\nSocial distancing, meanwhile, is my specialty, so I think I’m all set for the duration. I tend to avoid crowds as a personal policy and otherwise have never minded solitude.\n\nOn the other hand, what if I’ve been surrounded by sick people without realizing it? We now know that the incubation period of coronavirus, which can be as much as two weeks, means people can be infected and contagious without being symptomatic. And, without adequate tests, we have no way of knowing how many people are infected. The latest number reported Tuesday — more than 750 cases in the United States — is surely far below the actual number.\n\nSelf-quarantine is the state of nature for an at-home writer in residence. It comes with the job. And there may be to some a certain appeal to the notion. Imagine the quiet, the calm, the serenity, if everyone stayed indoors for a few weeks. Or, alternatively, the domestic disputes, disorder and dysfunction when cabin fever peaks.\n\nMany of my former Georgetown neighbors in Washington are being asked to self-quarantine after discovering that the rector of Christ Church was unknowingly infected as he shook hundreds of parishioners’ hands over the past couple of weeks. Some of those congregants are well within the designated demographic — we’ll call them older — that covid-19 can hit hard.\n\nThe latest entry in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advice column is that people over 60 should “stock up,” in case they’re forced to stay home for a long period, and to avoid crowds. But stocking up means what, exactly? And how much is enough? Naturally, I’ve made my list. For some reason, I thought ramen noodles should be on it, though I’ve never bought them before. Other items not usually in my cart — a gallon jug of Clorox, popsicles and saltines. One might think I was planning to get sick.\n\nBut do I do the shopping myself or order online? Am I being ridiculously paranoid or sensibly cautious? The constant media coverage, for which we are alternately grateful and resentful, begins to feel like an invitation to hysteria. Given that hand sanitizers and masks are out of stock everywhere, I’m buying 190-proof alcohol and glycerin to make my own sanitizer and avoid the busy checkout lines. Down South, of course, pollen coats everything, which is making lots of people cough and sneeze without having the bug.\n\nThe order of the day, then: Wash those hands, per usual. Check on your elderly neighbors, as we should anyway. Be prepared, but don’t panic. But even that message kindles paranoia. Or worse: some eye-rolling. In South Carolina, where I’m holed up at an undisclosed location, I’ve heard several people call the virus scare a nuisance to be ignored. With President Trump, normally a germaphobe, still shaking hands and promising that everything is just fine, it’s little wonder that some are skeptical.\n\nMy view is different: hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\n\nAnd, no matter what, keep plenty of duct tape on hand. It’s more comfortable than you might think.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB14-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB14-5",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1254469, "name": "Henry Olsen"}, "body": "Something similar happened in late 1997. Asian economic turmoil helped cause another massive one-day sell-off on Oct. 27, leading to a more than 7 percent decline in the Dow. Things weren’t good in Thailand, but Americans were largely unaffected. Unemployment, which was 4.7 percent in October 1997, dropped for another few years until it was a mere 3.8 percent in April 2000.\n\nSharp declines often occur after rapid rises. The 1987 crash was preceded by a nearly 50 percent increase in the Dow Jones average since the January prior. The crash merely took the market back temporarily to a level it had been at in early 1986, and a December recovery meant the market still closed up for the year. The 1997 drop was also preceded by a nearly 50 percent rise between January 1996 and July 1997. The drop took stocks back to their level from about a year prior, and as with 1987, the market’s rise quickly resumed, bringing the market back to its prior high by year’s end.\n\nThe declines of the past two weeks look eerily similar to these two examples. The Dow Jones rose nearly 19 percent between May 31 of last year and Feb. 12. The market rose by 43 percent  between mid-April 2017 and early February of this year, and even after Monday’s sell-off, the Dow was still higher than it was at year’s end 2018. As with 1987 and 1997, unemployment is low and dropping. There is as yet no sign that this is anything other than a scary but standard market correction.\n\nContrast this with the 2008 financial crash. Back then, the unemployment rate had been rising for nearly a year before the market’s sudden decline. Real gross domestic product had started to decline in early 2008, and the decline accelerated as the year went on. Median housing prices had also been falling for more than a year before the crash. The collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the stock market panic, merely confirmed what had been signaled in other data for quite some time.\n\nIf the coronavirus spread triggers a recession, we should be able to see it in other data besides the market. Firms will start announcing layoffs, and companies will announce sales declines. Claims for unemployment insurance will start to rise, and the number of hours worked per employee will likely fall. We likely are not yet through the crisis and won’t be until the spread of the seasonal disease stops naturally. For now, though, the market decline looks to be just another example of how traders use unwelcome news as an excuse to take profits.\n\nRudyard Kipling’s famous poem “If” contains sound advice for times like these: “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs,” he wrote, “yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.” Keep that in mind as the doomsayers bleat their brays of woe.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13-11", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13-11", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1153494, "name": "Gillian Brockell"}, "body": "The meme drew speculation that it was related to the QAnon conspiracy theorists, as The Washington Post’s Timothy Bella described here.\n\nBut Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics from 2013 to 2017, had another idea:\n\nNero was the notorious emperor of Rome, who, as legend has it, “fiddled while Rome burned.” By Monday morning, #NeroTrump was a top trend on Twitter.\n\nA history lesson is definitely in order.\n\nNero, a descendant of Julius Caesar, was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus in 37 A.D.; his mother Agrippina conspired by an incestuous marriage to make Nero the next in line for the throne. Her husband/uncle, the emperor Claudius, died by poisoning soon after, making Nero, 16 or 17 at the time, the fifth emperor of Rome.\n\nAgrippina attempted to rule via her son but was soon exiled and later executed. And as Nero grew into a young man, he was kind of always DTFF — down to feast and frolic. He threw lavish parties in extravagant palaces, slept with anyone he wanted, and even took to the stage as an actor, poet and musician.\n\nThe elites of Rome were not impressed. Orgies were one thing, but acting? In plays? That cheapened the throne, they complained.\n\nThen, in 64 A.D., Nero announced he wanted to level and rebuild most of city in a more contemporary style. The Roman Senate refused him permission. Soon afterward, the whole city caught on fire.\n\nIt burned for six days straight, then rekindled and burned for another three. Ten of Rome’s 14 districts were destroyed. And Nero soon began to build his massive “Golden House” on its smoldering ashes.\n\nBut did he really fiddle while Rome burned?\n\nNo, because fiddles didn’t exist until the Middle Ages. But he maybe played his lyre?\n\nHis first biographer, Tacitus, wrote in his “Annals” that Nero was 30 miles away in Antium at the time, “but at the very moment when Rome was aflame, he had mounted his private stage, and typifying the ills of the present by the calamities of the past, had sung the destruction of Troy.” \n\nBut later biographers were even less charitable. Suetonius claimed witnesses caught him setting the fires, and that he watched the city burn from a tower “and exulting, as he said, in ‘the beauty of the flames,’ he sang the whole of the ‘Sack of Ilium,’ in his regular stage costume.” Cassius Dio claimed he hired to a bunch of thugs to set fires and then watched from the palace, singing and playing the lyre in costume.\n\nThe famous expression that “Nero fiddled while Rome burned” came later, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica, but it was adapted over centuries from an original story.\n\nIn any case, Nero’s feckless response to the tragedy is now being compared to Trump’s Twitter behavior amid the growing crises of the coronavirus outbreak and the economic fallout. Monday morning, as Americans nervously awaited the opening bell on Wall Street, Trump tweeted his usual complaints about Democrats, the “Deep State” and the “Fake News Media.” \n\nSoon after Trump retweeted the fiddling meme, CNN legal analyst Renato Mariotti had this warning, “You might want to look up what happened to Nero.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB14-7", "level": 2,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1686126, "name": "Andrea Felsted"}, "body": "But Flybe had problems even before the outbreak. It was acquired in January 2019 for 2.2 million pounds ($2.8 million), or a penny a share. The buyer was Connect Airways, a venture including Branson’s Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.,  and airport operator Stobart Group Ltd., each with a 30% stake, as well as private equity firm Cyrus Capital with 40%. Together they invested about 110 million pounds.\n\nFlybe was Britain’s most important carrier for routes outside of London. But it’s difficult to turn a profit in the regional aviation market. Passenger numbers are limited, and even the smaller planes have significant fixed costs.\n\nThe airline avoided liquidation in January when Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government came out in support of state intervention and its owners agreed to inject another 30 million pounds, of which 25 million has been invested. It was able to defer some taxes, but a vital 100 million-pound loan, cuts to U.K. flight taxes in this month’s budget and state support for some specific routes were left to further negotiation. These items could not be agreed upon.\n\nThere was a case for state support given Flybe’s role in connecting more remote corners of the country. But the government was also probably mindful of the risk in rescuing failing firms. After all it didn’t step in to save the 178-year-old British tour operator Thomas Cook Group Plc last autumn. As my colleague Therese Raphael noted in January,  there was a danger that even a restructured Flybe wouldn’t have taken off as its owners hoped, creating the need for a more far-reaching rescue later on.\n\nBranson’s Virgin group could also have provided more funding, particularly as the British billionaire’s net worth has  been rocketed because of the increase in the value of suborbital space travel company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.\n\nThrough Virgin Atlantic, the group  has provided about 60 million pounds of Connect Airways’ funding to Flybe over the past year.  But it now has its own problems. New bookings have fallen between 40% and 50% over the last 10 days. Stobart Group, which will write down 50 million pounds from the failure, also wasn’t in a position to do more, having suspended its dividend in November, and pledged to sell off non-core assets.\n\nWhile the collapse is devastating for Flybe employees, propping up regional routes just isn’t viable with the world mindful of flying’s environmental impact. In the short term, funding would be better used to mitigate the impact of Flybe’s demise on workers, and in the longer term, invest in alternative transport routes, including rail.\n\nIt’s also worth casting the mind back to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Images of stranded tourists raised questions as to why the government didn’t step in there. But that reluctance now looks wise. If Thomas Cook had received a bailout, with the coronavirus’s potential hit to tourism in the impending spring and summer travel season, the government would have been facing a potentially even bigger headache than that for a regional airline.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nAndrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

That’s on top of the already-in-place no change fee for trips that have been scheduled from Feb. 24 to April 24 for Italy, South Korea, Hong Kong, Wuhan and the rest of mainland China.\n JetBlue\n JetBlue has announced the airline will suspend change and cancel fees for new flights booked from Feb. 27 through March 11. The policy runs through June 1 in an effort to anticipate the spread of the coronavirus in the event that it expands into one of JetBlue’s travel areas.\n “While authorities have not issued any travel restrictions to the locations we fly, we want to give our customers some peace of mind that we are ready to support them should the situation change,” said the airline’s president and chief operating officer, Joanna Geraghty, in a statement.\n Alaska Airlines\n Starting Monday, Alaska is offering a “peace of mind” waiver for travelers who have purchased tickets from Feb. 27 through March 12. Alaska will allow customers to bank any travel costs associated with canceled tickets as long as the future trip is completed by New Year’s Eve. Alaska will also step up its cleaning procedure for its planes and has issued new sanitary guidance for fliers that include cleaning wipes, hand sanitizer and cutting refills on single-use beverage cups.\n [Coronavirus live updates]\n Delta\n In addition to suspending travel from the United States to Shanghai and Beijing, Delta is giving customers the option to make a one-time change without any fees for those whose plans included Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul and all locations in Italy, including such popular locations as Bologna, Milan, Rome, Turin and Venice, through April 30.\n United Airlines\n After expanding flight suspensions to Asia, United is allowing refunds for flights, even nonrefundable tickets, purchased for Wuhan, China, from Jan. 22 through March 29. For travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Northern Italy through June 30, United is waiving the change fee and any difference in fare for the same cities as the original ticket.\n Read more: \n Not ready to book a flight?

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1691547, "name": "Shuli Ren"}, "body": "Established in the 1990s, Founder has expanded into every business imaginable. The company had 23 onshore issues outstanding as of early December, when it first missed a payment, with two-thirds, or 24 billion yuan ($3.43 billion), due over the next year. Its $300 million dollar bond due this April is trading at 33 cents on the dollar.\n\nWhile restructuring can be painfully slow in China, a speedier process isn’t necessarily good news for Founder’s dollar investors.\n\nSo far, distressed state-owned enterprises have treated foreigners with kid gloves, trying to settle their offshore bills before slaughtering traders onshore. Bohai Steel Group Co. made good on an offshore bond in 2017 after defaulting onshore a year earlier, and only started restructuring last year. While commodities trader Tewoo Group Co. in November became the first SOE since 1998 to not pay offshore investors back in full, it still offered something. Qinghai Provincial Investment Group this month agreed to pay out three dollar bonds, although some with as little as 37.65 cents for every dollar of debt: 54% of its investors accepted.\n\nFor those Qinghai investors who complained they were “treated as beggars,” just wait and see what happens with Founder. With this restructuring, suppliers and banks will be the first in the pecking order, not offshore bond investors. Take a look at who’s on Founder’s all-star restructuring team: the People’s Bank of China, various banking regulators and the Ministry of Education — the ultimate parent of Peking University. Banks will get their money back before everyone else. \n\nIt’s about time the government stepped in. Just like HNA, which is on the verge of a takeover, Founder’s painful drama has been dragging on for too long. The company has had trouble getting much-needed capital injections from fellow SOEs because its ownership and state links are unclear. It’s also mired in a legal battle with fugitive businessman and social media sensation Guo Wengui, persona non grata for aspiring SOE bosses.\n\nLi You was Founder’s CEO until 2015, when he was arrested for insider trading involving Guo. The executive was given a four-and-a-half-year sentence and fined 750 million yuan. In a series of pending lawsuits against Peking University, Li and his associates, who currently own 30% of the conglomerate, now claim they should have control of the company. Meanwhile, Founder said a property developer controlled by Guo owes it 14 billion yuan in unpaid bills. A court-ordered restructuring would wipe out all equity-holders’ rights — not to mention air their dirty laundry.\n\nNo doubt, the coronavirus outbreak could be a black swan that drags China Inc. further into a liquidity crisis. But at least investors are now psychologically prepared for a drastic economic slowdown, defaults and bankruptcies. Beijing might as well use this opportunity to clean out its closets. \n\nTo contact the author of this story: Shuli Ren at sren38@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nShuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2072221, "name": "Lori Aratani"}, "body": "Other international carriers have sharply curtailed or stopped service to China. British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Air France and Lion Air are among the airlines that have suspended service.\n\nIn a release announcing the change, Delta said it would operate flights through Wednesday to ensure customers who want to leave China have options to do so. The airline’s last China-bound flight will leave the United States on Monday. Its last flight from China would depart Wednesday. Flights will remain suspended through April 30.\n\nAmerican Airlines said flights would remain grounded through March 28 but that officials would monitor the situation to see if American would extend the cancellations.\n\nUnited said it will suspend all operations between its hub cities in Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai beginning Thursday.\n\nUntil then, the airline will continue to operate select flights to ensure its U.S.-based employees and customers, are able to return home. However, the airline will continue operating one daily flight between San Francisco and Hong Kong.\n\nUnited will operate its last flight from China to the United States on Wednesday. The last flights from the United States to China will be Tuesday. The airline said it expects to resume service March 28 but will continue to monitor the situation.\n\nMore than 200 people — all in China — have died after contracting the virus, and the number of people infected reached 9,720 as of Friday morning, including nine cases in the self-governing island of Taiwan. The State Department has urged Americans not to travel to China.\n\nSo far six people in the United States have been diagnosed with the virus. This week, U.S. health officials expanded the number of airports where travelers will be screened for the virus from five to 20. They say that those most vulnerable are people who have traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, or who have had close contact with people who have traveled there.\n\nBut much is still unknown about the virus and how it might mutate. Health officials believe that precautionary measures, such as the decision to impose a federal quarantine on 195 evacuees who returned to the United States on a flight from Wuhan this week will help prevent the virus from spreading.\n\nNancy Messonnier, the top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is overseeing the U.S. coronavirus response, said officials imposed the quarantine because new cases in China have surged dramatically over the last week. She cited reports that the virus spreads from person to person and sometimes even before the infected person shows symptoms. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets, such as coughing and sneezing.\n\n“If we take strong measures now, we may be able to blunt the impact of the virus on the United States,” she said in a briefing with reporters Friday. “We are facing an unprecedented public health threat.” \n\nOn Thursday the union representing American Airlines pilots filed suit in a Texas court seeking to stop the airline from flying to China, saying the coronavirus posed a threat to both crew members and the public.\n\n“Recent events relating to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China have created a threat to the safety of passengers and flight crew traveling to and from that country,” said the lawsuit filed on behalf of the Allied Pilots Association, which represents the 15,000 pilots at American.\n\nIn a message to pilots, union president Eric Ferguson said pilots should decline any assignment that would take them to China.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-7",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1718923, "name": "Bloomberg News"}, "body": "This creates a problem for investors: With China’s real economy practically shut down, they don’t know how to trade or position themselves. That could make things more volatile.\n\nConsider how this is playing out in the hardware supply chain. Until recently, this sector was a shining star, as investors bet that consumers would rush to buy 5G phones later this year. The coronavirus outbreak has completely changed the calculus. In the smartphone-manufacturing provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong, the government has forced employees to stay home until Feb. 10. More delays could be coming; these two areas are the hardest-hit after Hubei, the epicenter of the virus. How can smartphone makers and their suppliers fill demand – if there is any – when factories are closed?\n\nAnd then there’s the trouble of earnings reports. While the U.S. market is getting propped up by solid corporate profits from the likes of Amazon.com Inc., we may not see anything out of China for weeks, if not months. Because of strict travel restrictions, auditors may not be able to visit company sites and do their work. The Hong Kong bourse, which hosts more than 1,000 mainland companies, may have to extend the March 31 deadline for 2019 reports.\n\nThat leaves investors only with broad-brush data on the outbreak. Depending on their mood, those reports can be read as glass half-full or half-empty. For example, the number of new patients in Hubei has been roughly steady for three consecutive days. Optimists could see that as evidence of China’s bureaucratic machine effectively controlling the disease, while pessimists might say this is proof of underreporting. Diagnosis tool kits are in short supply, so conceivably, thousands of infected people are just waiting to be tested positive.\n\nYou might ask why China is willing to open its financial markets so soon, with businesses closed and factories quiet. To its credit, Beijing has learned a thing or two after the stock rout of 2015, when it put indefinite trading halts on as many as half of mainland-listed firms. In a stroke, public markets were practically transformed into a private one. Not only did that sour investor appetite, it also delayed MSCI Inc.’s decision to include A-shares in its well-tracked indexes. So we’re unlikely to see a repeat performance, even if bureaucrats do conduct window guidance now and then to stem a selloff.\n\nCompared with the SARS epidemic, whose spread was dangerously underreported, China has vastly improved its communication strategy. It now releases updates of confirmed cases twice daily.\n\nBeijing is left with few good options, with a viable vaccine possibly months or even years away. Still, the government can do more to improve transparency. It could, for instance, open up its medical-supply database so the public can assess the severity of test-kit shortages for itself. China also needs to prove its bureaucratic apparatus works – and a lot more urgently than in 2003, when the economy was operating at full steam. Until then, we’re left with wild guessing games.\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.net, Shuli Ren\n\nThis column does not necessarily

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1071238, "name": "Taylor Telford"}, "body": "The virus, which has infected 7,700 and killed 170 in China, has paralyzed China’s workforce, with at least three provinces barring all nonessential business activity until Feb. 10. In Hubei province, which has seen the highest number of cases, business activity has been suspended until Feb. 14. And as authorities scramble for solutions to contain the spread, global firms with roots in China have been forced to shut their doors or temporarily freeze operations, without any certainty as to how long the disruption will last.\n\n“Companies are taking decisive action over their exposure to China, such as cancelling flights, closing stores and shutting factories,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, wrote Thursday in a note to investors. “It is already clear that earnings will be hit as a result of the coronavirus and we still don’t know when the health incident will be contained.”\n\nStarbucks earlier this week shuttered more than 2,000 locations in China — more than half its stores in the country — and McDonald’s, KFC and Apple have also announced closures. Google said it closed its five offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and self-governing Taiwan.\n\nThe outbreak is taking a marked toll on the airline industry, as carriers such as British Airways and American Airlines have reduced direct flights to and from China. Germany’s Lufthansa canceled all Chinese flights until Feb. 9, although it said it would continue to service Hong Kong.\n\nStarbucks shares were down more than 2 percent in premarket trading. Caterpillar, a bellwether stock for the global economy, was off 1.10 percent in premarket trading. Airlines Delta, American and United were all down more than 1 percent.\n\nPassenger air traffic was about 35 percent lower at the SARS outbreak’s worst point for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the International Air Transport Association. And for 2003 as a whole, the association estimated that SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, cost those carriers 8 percent of their revenue, or roughly $6 billion at the time.\n\nInvestors are waiting to see whether the World Health Organization, which has called a meeting for later Thursday, will designate the outbreak a global emergency. It declined to take that step last week, and such a move Thursday could signal that the worst is yet to come, for China and global businesses.\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued that the virus could have a positive impact on the U.S. economy.\n\n“I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America,” Ross said.\n\nConcerns sent investors flocking to safer ground, with gold — a haven in times of turmoil — up 0.6 percent. Brent crude was hit hard, brushing its lowest price of 2020 before recovering slightly, trading down 2.6 percent at $57.35 a barrel.\n\nAt a Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank is closely monitoring the situation in China but that it’s too early to know how big a bite it will take out of the global economy.\n\n“The situation is really in its early stages, and it is very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be,” Powell said. “I’m not going to speculate about it at this point. . . . We are very carefully monitoring the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook’s stock took a beating after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations but also showed a 51 percent rise in expenses compared to 2018. The social media giant’s shares were down more than 7.7 percent in premarket trading.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

More people in China have been confirmed to have the virus than those who had the virus known as SARS during the outbreak in 2002-2003. (Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images) \n      By  From AP and staff reports \n \n \n \n January 29 at 5:55 PM \n Countries began evacuating their citizens Wednesday from the Chinese city hardest hit by a new virus. The coronavirus has infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the severe virus known as SARS.\n The number of confirmed cases jumped to 6,078, more than the 5,327 in mainland China during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.\n The death toll rose to 132, which is still lower than the 348 people who were killed in China by SARS, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. Scientists say there are many questions to be answered about the new virus, including how transmissible and severe it is. Virus symptoms include cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia.\n The United States and Japan evacuated 200 of their citizens from the city of Wuhan, which Chinese authorities have shut down to try to contain the virus. Airlines announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.\n The U.S. plane was headed to California on Wednesday after a refueling stop in Alaska. All 201 passengers, who included diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, passed health screenings in China and Anchorage.\n In China’s Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed.\n    People line up to buy face masks at a drugstore in Nanjing in eastern China on Wednesday. The United States and Japan were among the countries to begin evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. (Chinatopix via AP) \n Sara Platto, an Italian animal behavior researcher and veterinarian, said there were 25 Italians stuck in Wuhan who stay in touch online.\n “My son turned 12 on January 23, the first day of the lockdown in Wuhan. So he couldn’t invite his friends over. We had a remote birthday celebration, with people ‘visiting’ him over WeChat,” Platto said, referring to a Chinese messaging app. “We called it the epidemic birthday.”\n People spending most of their times indoors have to deal with boredom.\n Her son Matteo usually has a very busy agenda between his school, sports and volunteer work, but now “it’s like suddenly everything has slowed down,” Platto said. As with other international schools, classes are moving online until the all-clear is sounded.\n The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS.\n The source of the virus and the full extent of its spread are still unknown. But the World Health Organization said most cases so far “have been milder, with around 20 percent of those infected experiencing severe illness.”\n Scientists expect many crucial questions about the virus’s behavior will be answered in the coming weeks as the outbreak evolves and it becomes clearer how people are infected.\n Read more from KidsPost:\n We call a virus a bug.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1762338, "name": "Max Nisen"}, "body": "Since then, the world has learned more about how the virus spreads, and the disconcerting number of asymptomatic infections has helped make the case for the broad use of masks. Multiple Asian countries where mask use was prevalent even before the pandemic have had substantially better outcomes, with various other effective public-health measures likely also playing a role.\n\nIn many parts of the U.S., even in states that are reopening, masks are now required, and wearing them has become more and more routine. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is enlisting celebrities such as comedian Chris Rock in an effort to turn the practice into a habit. In other areas, wearing a mask is seen as taking a side in a culture war, an issue made worse by Trump’s continued insistence on going barefaced. This attitude should change. The fact is, masks can play a vital role in prevention and containment. Americans should get used to the idea that they may be necessary at times even after the current crisis subsides.  \n\nUntil now, much of the government-backed effort to produce protective equipment has focused on supplying hospitals. While that should continue to be a priority, it’s worth taking extra steps to boost stocks of better surgical-style masks intended to support reopening states. Even relatively simple coverings can stop some virus-containing droplets that can spread Covid-19 to others, especially in combination with other hygiene and distancing measures. However, surgical-style masks are better at stopping virus-containing droplets and are easier to wear in summer heat. Any reduction in transmission to others is highly significant in containing the virus. A boost in availability would help in providing effective masks to people in areas and situations of particular concern. \n\nMasks aren’t quite as crucial in uncrowded and outdoor spaces in regions where the virus isn’t circulating much. They’re arguably essential in crowded and poorly ventilated areas, particularly in hot spots, and easy availability and even targeted enforcement should be the rule in those situations. The places where masks won’t do as much good now may be tomorrow’s areas of concern. Authorities in those areas should be ready to respond. \n\nEventually, the focus can shift to the next crisis, where masks can play a role in prevention instead of catch-up. Pandemic-scale stockpiles for broad public use should be comparatively easy and cheap to manufacture over the long run, once the immediate threat of the epidemic is over. There should be a quicker trigger going forward to recommend or require masks when an airborne threat emerges, and robust plans to deploy them as a broad public-health measure. And hopefully by then, the dangerous politicization of wearing masks and taking other common-sense health measures that’s occurring in some places today will have been overcome by more effective public messaging and education.\n\nPandemic preparation is hard and is only effective and durable under good leadership. Learning a relatively easy lesson about masks could help provide at least a bit of insurance. \n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMax Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

So a lot of the regulations that we have are really Stan’s inspiration and helpful creation.”\n\nCohen, of Chevy Chase, Md., died on April 20 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda after battling covid-19, his family said. The father of four and grandfather to six was 86.\n\nCohen, born in New Brunswick, Canada, graduated from New York University with a degree in English and journalism, his family said.\n\nCohen’s enthusiasm for his work translated into his general life as well, his wife said. He was part of the board of a local public library and was involved in his children’s schools. He was also an active member of his synagogue, Adas Israel Congregation, and was passionate about Jewish organizations and causes.\n\n“He was a joiner,” Ducat said. “He has a variety of interests and a variety of passions.”\n\nDespite suffering a fall that injured his spine and moving into an acute care center, Cohen remained engaged in the world around him, his wife said. Ducat would bring him a newspaper every day and recalls him using Zoom to call into various board meetings that he was still active on.\n\n“He was very connected, still, to life,” Ducat said.\n\nDucat said the last time she was able to see her husband was on March 12, before the home was closed to visitors due to the coronavirus.\n\nDucat, who held Seder via Zoom, said she was able to get her husband on the phone where “he sang a couple songs with us.”\n\nThe next day, she said, Cohen started to exhibit symptoms of the virus. He was admitted to the hospital on April 14 and tested positive for covid-19.\n\nRosenfelt remembers his colleague and friend’s unwavering spirit, especially in their last conversation.\n\n“He had the same twinkle in his eye,” Rosenfelt said, “the same love of life, family, news media and all things that went into American life.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2,

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \n          Alex Horton General assignment reporter covering national and breaking news\n  \n \n \n \n \n May 27 at 11:24 AM \n An Army Reserve soldier became the third U.S. service member to die of complications from a coronavirus infection, the Army said, as the number of cases among American troops passed 6,100 worldwide.\n Sgt. Simon Zamudio, a unit supply specialist assigned to Fort Sheridan, Ill., died on May 22, the Army Reserve said Wednesday. He enlisted in October 2015 and had not been mobilized as part of the military’s coronavirus response, an Army official said.\n    Sgt. Simon Zamudio. (U.S. Army Reserve) \n Zamudio was 34, according to an online obituary. His mother died three days later on Memorial Day, also of complications from a coronavirus infection, according to a GoFundMe set up for her family.\n It has been six weeks since the last service member died of coronavirus complications.\n Navy Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr., a sailor assigned to the virus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt, died in a naval hospital in Guam in April. Douglas Hickok, a captain in the New Jersey Army National Guard, died in a civilian hospital in March before his unit was mobilized to assist with the pandemic response.\n There have been a total of 35 coronavirus-linked deaths associated with the Defense Department, the agency’s data shows. Most of those deaths, 18, occurred among the civilian employee ranks. Nine contractors have died, as have five military dependents.\n [Grieving families and veterans face an obstacle for observing Memorial Day — a pandemic]\n The Pentagon data show 165 service members required hospitalization because of virus complications.\n The relatively low number of deaths and hospitalizations among the military’s 2.2 million service members, compared with cases among the rest of the U.S. population, could be related to age and health. Epidemiologists have suggested those factors may have contributed to a high percentage of asymptomatic transmission aboard the Theodore Roosevelt.\n Still, the pandemic has reshaped how the military recruits, disrupted boot camp and crippled the Theodore Roosevelt, one of the Navy’s 11 aircraft carriers.\n More than 55,000 service members are responding to the pandemic in various ways including food distribution and manning testing sites, the Pentagon said, including 46,000 mobilized through the National Guard and 3,000 in the Army Reserve.\n The Trump administration set many mobilizations to end on June 24, which at 89 days is one day shy of the threshold needed for some guardsmen to accrue education and retirement benefits. The timing of those orders did not appear to be coincidental, critics and lawmakers have said.\n “You think they just pulled 89 out of a hat?” Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), a combat veteran and guardsman, told Politico. “No. This isn’t a coincidence. We’re not idiots. This is spitting at our soldiers who have done the right thing.”\n The National Guard Bureau said in a statement last week that it is working with the Defense Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to “determine the best ways to care for our Guard men and women in this unprecedented response.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2674421, "name": "Hamil R. Harris"}, "body": "Joyner and her husband Ceasar Joyner, 56, shared that home with Fuller in Suitland. On April 8, they welcomed a new baby girl.\n\nBut before the generations could gather together, Fuller developed a fever and cough. She was hospitalized with covid-19.\n\nThe family’s concerns grew as Fuller’s daughter, Connie D. Madden, 64, a dialysis patient, also contracted the coronavirus. Mother and daughter died within days of each other in April.\n\nCeasar Joyner also grew ill with covid-19 and was hospitalized. For weeks he saw his wife and new daughter only through Zoom visits.\n\n“I have had so many times to sit back and process what is taking place. God has a way of preparing you for things,” said Tonya Joyner, who is Madden’s niece. “I had to sit back and say to myself, He was preparing me for this all along. I pray every morning and night. Sometimes I have to pray in the middle of the day. This made me realize that life is really short.”\n\nLike so many people of color, Fuller’s parents migrated to D.C. from South Carolina in search of a better life. She was one of seven children born to Richard and Exie Gage. Her sister Ophelia Boyd said Fuller was the oldest sibling and took her role seriously.\n\n“She looked over us,” Boyd said. “She felt that it was her duty.”\n\nFuller worked at St. Elizabeths, the District’s psychiatric hospital, where her family said she had cared for John W. Hinckley Jr., who was treated there after he shot President Ronald Reagan and three others outside a D.C. hotel.\n\nFuller was a member of Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in Capitol Heights, a member of the Fraternal Order of the Elks, the Order of the Eastern Star and she loved to cook soul food. While Joyner said her grandmother had a great recipe for sweet potato pie, Boyd said she most enjoyed her sister’s pinto beans.\n\n“I miss my sister so much,” Boyd said. “I can’t question God. We did a lot together. We went to church. We went out. Our family was so close.”\n\nFuller had two sons, but Connie Madden was her only daughter.\n\nMadden, who had a son and daughter of her own, worked as a teacher’s aide at St. Philip the Apostle Catholic Church in Camp Springs. She lived in Southeast Washington.\n\n“She loved children,” Tonya Joyner said. “Aunt Connie loved all the kids at her school.”\n\nJoyner said her grandmother developed a fever and cough in mid-April and at first thought it was a bout with allergies. After a call to 911, she went to Southern Maryland Hospital and, after treatment, appeared to be stabilizing.\n\n“She was eating, talking and holding her own,” Joyner said. But Fuller took a turn for the worse. She was put on a ventilator and died April 24. Madden ended up at a hospital in Baltimore and died three days later.\n\nBy that time, Ceasar Joyner was hospitalized. Over 21 days, he and his wife shared life with their first child, Brielle, through Zoom, in the same way political officials, educational institutions and churches have continued to gather virtually. “I was really scared,” he said, “but God was in control.”\n\nHe was discharged May 15.\n\nHis wife is grateful, but their home has changed.\n\n“It is bittersweet because I would have liked to have my grandmother and my aunt here to enjoy this moment with the baby,” Tonya Joyner said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Che Restaurant reposted the post and received another 700-plus likes, to which Drummond responded: “Thank you for being amazing.”\n\n     View this post on Instagram\n\n   Today, started off as slow day at work getting there for my double shift. The past week, overall, has been pretty slow of course due to COVID. Restaurants and staff have been struggling, as you can imagine. Little did I know that today I would get a tip no server would guess that they would ever receive when they open that check book. Unknowingly, I was seated and served a table with @andredrummondd . I had no idea who he was, and hadn’t seen him here before but we @che.delray always welcome our new customers. When I was given the checkbook, I went to put in the tip  information to close the table and I couldn’t believe it. From a $160 check, the tip read $1,000. I was shaking and had tears of happiness after what he left me. I had no idea how to react, I didn’t want to draw attention but at the same time I couldn’t describe the the amount of appreciation I had/ have. It’s so amazing to see people displaying acts of kindness in these uncertain times. This is a story I will never forget, thank you again so much @andredrummondd !! #Blessed\n A post shared by  •Kasandra Idalia Diaz• (@kaxandra.diaz) on May 23, 2020 at 7:27pm PDT\n\n\n\n\nSince signing a five-year, $127 million contract in 2016, Drummond has made numerous charitable donations.\n\nIn April, the NBA’s leading rebounder donated $100,000 to the Middlesex Health Emergency Fund Relief, located in native Middletown, Conn., as well as an additional $60,000 to help support event staff and other hourly staff members at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ arena.\n\nDrummond also announced that he and JBL Audio are partnering to bring quality headphones to underprivileged youth in Cleveland and Detroit as they transition to a new, online, learning environment.\n\nDiaz, a Boca Raton High School class of 2020 graduate, plans to put her tip money toward furthering her education this fall at Palm Beach State College.\n\n“This tip definitely helped make up for graduation and prom being canceled,” Diaz said. “It sprayed some sunshine on these rainy days.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB21-1", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1104574, "name": "Jake Russell"}, "body": "“Not only is that not good for my personal reputation, it’s also not true,\" McMahon said in a footnoted deposition in Tuesday’s filings. “And I’m – I’m not — not trying to buy the XFL. I’m not going to be a bidder. And the other thing, too, is that . . . you’ve damaged the possibility of attracting some bidders because it looks like that, ‘Oh, okay, I see what Vince is going to do.’ . . . No one helped the bidding process by getting that out there.”\n\nIn Tuesday’s filing, the XFL’s parent company, Alpha Entertainment, accused the committee of having a “vendetta” against McMahon and that its “baseless accusations” chased him away as a potential bidder. Another filing Tuesday revealed McMahon invested $200 million of his own money into the eight-team league.\n\n“I think I was trying to make up my mind,” McMahon said when asked why he reserved the right to be a bidder in April’s bankruptcy filing if he had no interest in being one. “I don’t know why that’s out there, making me out to be the bad guy, [that] I’m going to buy the XFL back for pennies on the dollar, basically. That helped me move into the direction of I’m not going to be a bidder, not going to have anything to do with it. I do hope that someone will pay a lot of money for it, and I do hope that it will survive.”\n\nAlpha Entertainment agreed to extend the process of selling the XFL until the first week of August (a date the company says it understands is not acceptable for the committee of unsecured creditors), but stated that a delay beyond that time frame will jeopardize the XFL’s ability to restart in 2021.\n\nTuesday’s filing states that the XFL’s investment banker, Houlihan Lokey, is in discussions with “dozens of potential purchasers” and that “substantially all” have indicated that playing in the spring of 2021 is important to them. Houlihan Lokey’s managing director William H. Hardie III stated in the filing that, as of Monday, 20 potential bidders signed nondisclosure agreements to access confidential company information and six more are in the process of signing nondisclosure agreements to access that data.\n\nXFL president Jeffrey Pollack reached out to venues in Seattle and St. Louis about renewing their lease agreements, according to The Athletic. The league experienced significant fan turnout in both cities in 2020. Fox 26 in Houston reported that two XFL representatives reached out to the University of Houston regarding practice and rental agreements that were previously in place with the league’s Houston Roughnecks.\n\nThe XFL kicked off on Feb. 8, but the league’s 2020 season lasted just five weeks before it was suspended, and ultimately canceled in March due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The league then suspended operations and laid off most of its employees on April 10, before filing for bankruptcy three days later.\n\nRead more from Post Sports:", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB17", "parent": null}, "score": 0.09, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": false, "id": "IAB17-12", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB17-12", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB17"}, "score": 0.05, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": false, "id": "02002000", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/02002000", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/02000000"}, "score": 0.06, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 2868, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[2322, 2324]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fox_Broadcasting_Company"}, "score": 0.9890870451927185, "text": "Fox", "types": ["Network", "Broadcaster", "Agent", "BroadcastNetwork", "Organisation", "TelevisionStation"]}, {"indices": [[2163, 2169]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seattle"}, "score": 0.9980521202087402, "text": "Seattle", "types": ["PopulatedPlace", "Place", "Location", "Settlement", "City"]}, {"indices": [[1632, 1648]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment_banking"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "investment banker", "types": ["Institution", "University", "PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[180, 182], [480, 482], [1037, 1039], [1355, 1357], [1558, 1560], [1626, 1628], [2108, 2110], [2358, 2360], [2533, 2535]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/XFL"}, "score": 0.9993467926979065, "text": "XFL", "types": ["Agent", "Organisation", "League", "SportsLeague", "AmericanFootballLeague", "Place"]}, {"indices": [[1950, 1973], [2061, 2084]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Non-disclosure_agreement"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "nondisclosure agreements", "types": ["Company", "Contract"]}, {"indices": [[2332, 2338], [2411, 2417], [2508, 2514]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston"}, "score": 0.9961933493614197, "text": "Houston", "types": ["PopulatedPlace", "Place", "Location", "Settlement", "City"]}, {"indices": [[886, 895], [2811, 2820]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bankruptcy"}, "score": 0.984913170337677, "text": "bankruptcy", "types": ["Company", "Agent", "Status"]}, {"indices": [[2698, 2705]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandemic"}, "score": 0.9954671263694763, "text": "pandemic", "types": ["Epidemic", "Arachnid"]}, {"indices": [[2686, 2696]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "coronavirus", "types": ["Species", "Eukaryote"]}, {"indices": [[2175, 2183]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "St. Louis", "types": ["Place"]}, {"indices": [[363, 367]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Vince", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[381, 382], [1186, 1187], [1200, 1201], [1259, 1260]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "do", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[1651, 1664], [1824, 1837]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Houlihan Lokey", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[1859, 1879]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "William H.

Barack and I send our sincerest love and prayers to his family.”\n\nJerman, 91, died at Sentara Northern Virginia Medical Center in Woodbridge, his family said. He had served presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Barack Obama.\n\nOne of four children of a farmworker, Jerman had grown up so poor in rural Seaboard, N.C., that he had to put cardboard in his shoes when they wore out. He left school after seventh grade to help support his family.\n\nBut with diligence, discretion and grace he rose to spend much of his life as a witness to history at the center of power in Washington.\n\nHe and Gladys were married in Emporia, Va., in 1952. Both were 20. He eventually made his way to Washington and found work catering for families in Georgetown, his granddaughter Jamila Garrett said.\n\nHe brought his family to Washington and settled into a house on Sherman Circle, in Petworth, where he would live for most of his life. He would often walk the seven miles from there to his catering jobs in Georgetown, his granddaughter said.\n\nThen in 1957, his best friend, Eugene Allen, who worked as a White House butler, asked whether he would like a job there. “Oh, I don’t know if I want to do that,” he responded, according to his granddaughter. But he decided to try it out.\n\nEisenhower was in his second term as president. Jerman started out working as a cleaner.\n\nWhen the Kennedy administration began, Jerman caught the attention of the first lady, who liked him and promoted him to the post of butler. “She trusted him with her children,” Garrett said.\n\n“He always talked about the importance of service,” she said. “The Kennedys, he loved them.”\n\nWhen the president was assassinated in 1963, he went to one of the rooms in the White House and wept.\n\n“He felt like he lost a member of his family,” his granddaughter said.\n\nBut it was when Johnson entered office that a special connection was made.\n\nJerman often told the story about how he made a mistake setting the table for an important White House dinner. He had set a fork instead of a soup spoon at the president’s place, Garrett said.\n\nJohnson said he couldn’t eat soup with a fork and asked who had placed the wrong utensil. Jerman thought he was going to be fired, but he stepped forward, confessed and apologized.\n\nJohnson was impressed. He brought Jerman to the table, introduced him to the guests, and said, “He is in charge now,” Garrett said.\n\nWhen Jerman’s wife was terminally ill, Johnson sent him food and doctors. His wife was only in her 30s. They had five children and had been married 14 years.\n\nJerman later remarried, Garrett said. His second wife, Helen, died in the 1990s.\n\n“I never heard him complain,” Garrett said. “Never, ever. He would get off work, he would be so tired. Sometimes he would come home and get a couple hours of sleep and go right back to work.”\n\nAnother granddaughter, Shani Rivas, said: “He spoke highly of everybody who was ever in the White House. He never talked about their political parties. He always said how kind all of them really were.”\n\nIn addition to his children, he had 12 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.\n\nHis granddaughters said he was a loving and generous man, and he also fixed cars and roofs.\n\nAnd he insisted on proper table settings.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 965506, "name": "Ovetta Wiggins"}, "body": "Advocates and others are urging Gov. Larry Hogan (R) to commute the sentence of  the state’s longest-serving female prisoner.\n\nHouse Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County) joined a legislative effort led by Del. Charlotte Crutchfield (D-Montgomery) asking the governor to use his clemency power to release Pretty. About 50 lawmakers signed a letter sent to Hogan with the request Wednesday.\n\n“Even if Ms. Pretty fully recovers from covid-19, she will continue to be at risk in the correctional environment given her age and preexisting conditions,” the letter reads. It was not immediately clear what were those conditions.\n\nA spokesman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCrutchfield wrote that “there was no reason to believe” that Pretty would not eventually be released, if she met the criteria established for parole when she was sentenced in 1978. She said Pretty has obtained a degree in sociology from Morgan State University, counsels young women and has not had an infraction in more than two decades.\n\n“Though she was convicted of a violent crime, she is not a violent person,” the letter reads.\n\nPretty, who was interviewed by Diane Sawyer for a special on women behind bars in 2015, was charged for her involvement in the murder of a Northwest Baltimore grocer in 1978. She worked at the store at the time and helped her boyfriend tie up the owner during a robbery.\n\nShe told Sawyer she is haunted by Louis Thomas’s pleas, begging not to die. She recalled telling the grocer to “just listen to what he tells him to do and nobody was going to die.”\n\nShe fled the store and later heard gunshots. Her boyfriend, who she said used to  abuse her, had shot and killed Thomas.\n\nIn 2003, Pretty asked then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) to change her sentence to the death penalty.\n\n“I wrote Gov. Ehrlich and asked him for lethal injection,” she said in the interview. “Because of the victim’s family and everybody. I wanted them to know that I was sorry for the crime that I had committed.”\n\nLeigh Goodmark and Lila Meadow, Pretty’s attorneys, said they have been pushing for her release long before the pandemic. Pretty was recommended for parole in 2008 and was rejected in 2011 by then-Gov. Martin O’Malley (D). She was then recommended for parole in 2015 and rejected in 2019 by Hogan.\n\nMaryland is one of three states, with California and Oklahoma, that requires the governor’s signature to parole inmates sentenced to life.\n\n“The whole reason we have parole is to show that people can change,” Goodmark said. “If parole means anything you have to look at Eraina Pretty and say she has done everything she has been told to do. The one thing she can’t change is what put her in prison.”\n\nPretty’s daughter, Kecha Dunn, spoke to her mother briefly this week and “she seems to be doing okay,” according to Goodmark. She has been released from the hospital and is back at the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women at Jessup. Pretty’s lawyers did not know if she still had covid-19.\n\n“They haven’t talked in detail about the medical stuff,” Goodmark said. “After three weeks, she just wanted to know that she was okay.”\n\nGoodmark and Meadow said they have tried to set up a legal call with their client, but have been unsuccessful.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links":

Thousands have been asked to evacuate as floodwaters gush into the communities along the Tittabawassee River, inundating homes and businesses and even prompting an emergency declaration from Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer (D).\n [Chicago breaks May rainfall record for third year in a row as heavy rains soak Midwest]\n The Edenville Dam was breached Tuesday evening after more than 2.5 inches of rain fell during the day. The dam sits about 18 miles upstream of Midland, a city of more than 40,000.\n That collapse sent floodwaters gushing into Sanford Lake, dammed up to power the Boyce Hydroelectric Plant. The Sanford dam succumbed shortly thereafter, the twin reservoirs of water left with no place to drain but into the city of Midland.\n    A view of the flooded area near the Sanford dam on Tuesday. Residents were told to evacuate due to the dams on Sanford and Wixom Lakes no longer being able to control or contain the amount of water flowing through the spill gates. (Kaytie Boomer/MLive.com/The Bay City Times via AP) \n According to the Associated Press, ten thousand residents have been evacuated.\n The National Weather Service in Detroit issued a rare flash flood emergency, the governor warning that downtown Midland could find itself under up to nine feet of water early Wednesday. The Weather Service bulletin described a “particularly dangerous situation” and “catastrophic” flood threat.\n “Right now the water is rising and we won’t know the extent of it for maybe the next twelve, fifteen hours,” said Whitmer at a press conference on Tuesday evening.\n Scores of businesses, many shuttered in the fallout of covid-19 and facing serious economic hardship, could be inundated by floodwaters as daylight dawns Wednesday.\n “This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before,” said Whitmer. “I feel like I’ve said that a lot over the last number of weeks, but this truly is a historic event that is playing out in the midst of another historic event.”\n Major flooding begins when the Tittabawassee River hits 28 feet; flood stage is at 24 feet. As of 6:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, river gauges reported a level of 34.28 feet — and rising. That’s enough to flood West Main Street from Main Street to Saginaw Road, with many homes experiencing overland flooding.\n It supersedes the historic 33.9 foot flood stage measured on September 13, 1986, which at the time was deemed a “once in 500 year flood.” National Weather Service hydrologists were forecasting a crest four feet higher early Wednesday. It remains unclear if that level will be reached.\n    A hydrograph showing the water level rising into unprecedented territory along the Tittabawassee River at Midland, Michigan on Wednesday, May 20.

According to her legal complaint, she was a hearing-and-speech assistant and her job entailed conducting newborn hearing screenings and assisting on speech language pathology diagnostics, as well as administrative duties.\n\nThe heart of Cusick’s legal complaint stems from what she claims was a failure of the hospital’s administrators to properly screen patients and others for covid-19 symptoms at the entrances to the facility. For example, by March 13, the hospital “had still not implemented any procedures for screening patients, visitors or members of the public upon entrance to the hospital, in clear violation of CDC recommendations,” the lawsuit alleges.\n\nCusick claimed she made her concerns known to her higher-ups. But after a new protocol was introduced for screening people entering the facility on March 16, Cusick alleged the guidelines were ignored. She also said she observed as social distancing measures were not being enforced in the hospital’s cafeteria.\n\nThe situation prompted Cusick to reach for her phone and tag the hospital in a Twitter post. “@MedStarWHC can we please follow @_DCHealth guidelines for eating in common areas?,” she wrote on March 16 under a video she posted of the busy cafeteria, according to images provided to The Post.\n\nA day later, Cusick again brought the issue up on Twitter, this time tagging the District’s mayor.\n\n“@MayorBowser why are cafeterias like this inside the hospitals not being held to the same standards as other public cafeterias/mass gatherings?,” she wrote on March 17, according to an image. “Please help protect our healthcare workers and the public @MedStarWHC currently has an open door policy, this is a public access cafeteria.”\n\nWith screening still allegedly not going on at the hospital’s entrances, on March 18 Cusick recorded an interview on her phone with an unidentified security guard who acknowledged individuals walking through the entrances were not being checked at the security desk. Cusick uploaded the clip.\n\n“I am posting this because I care for our patient safety,” she wrote later. “I have spoken to my superiors during our briefing and advocated for multiple precautionary measures that are recommended by the CDC, WHO, and @MayorBowser and have not seen action on the ‘frontlines.’”\n\nAccording to the complaint, Cusick was called into a conference room that same day, where members of management told her she had violated “her social media contract and had violated patient and employee rights” under HIPPA.\n\n“They further stated, tellingly, that it was inappropriate for Ms. Cusick to post things like this to social media because it made MedStar’s ‘brand’ look bad.”\n\nIn tears, Cusick agreed to delete the tweets and maintained “she had consistently voiced her concerns” to her superiors “to no avail,” according to the lawsuit. Social media was a last resort to get management’s attention, she claimed.\n\nAfter the meeting, Cusick was forced to turn over her hospital identification badge, and all her subsequent work shifts

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1678300, "name": "Mark Stevenson"}, "body": "The anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption said in a report Monday that it got access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between March 18 and May 12. It showed that in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 death certificates, doctors included the words “SARS,” “COV2,” “COV,” “Covid 19,” or “new coronavirus.”\n\nThe virus’ technical name is SARS-CoV-2. The notes the group counted included terms like “suspected,” “probable”, or “possible” role of the virus in the deaths. In 3,209 of the certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.\n\nOnly 323 certificates list confirmed coronavirus as a cause of death; 1,045 other death certificates listed COVID-19 but didn’t specify if it was suspected or confirmed. The group did not say how it accessed the database, but noted that official counts showed only 1,060 coronavirus deaths during that March 18-May 12 period.\n\nMexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has acknowledged there are more deaths than have officially been reported, and has said a special commission will review the death figures. Her office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new report.\n\nMexico performs relatively few tests; only about 150,000 have been carried out so far in a nation of about 125 million people. Federal officials acknowledge some victims have died without being tested and have pledged that cases where death certificates mention coronavirus as a possible or probable cause of death would eventually be added to official death tolls. But they have suggested those “suspected” cases were only about a tenth of test-confirmed deaths.\n\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador has reacted angrily to new reports in the past that claimed Mexico was undercounting its deaths on the federal level, and Monday’s report is unlikely to please him. It comes from a group that he has criticized in the past for allegedly opposing his policies and representing business interests, and in the past he has mockingly called the group “Mexicans For Corruption”.\n\nThe group’s founder is Claudio X. Gonzalez, a lawyer, activist and the son of a prominent business magnate.\n\nMexico City, with about 9 million residents, has been the worst hit part of the country. The additional 3,245 deaths in Mexico City, if they are confirmed or added to official counts, would push the national death toll from the 5,332 reported by federal officials Monday to 8,577.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 960119, "name": "Timothy Bella"}, "body": "In the interview with the Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere, Warren reflected on the final days of Herring, who had been hospitalized with pneumonia in February and was close to recovery until someone at his facility in Oklahoma tested positive for the virus.\n\n“[T]hen he got sick, and then he died, by himself,” she said of Herring, who died of covid-19 on April 21 at the age of 86. “That’s the hard part — really hard part.”\n\nShe added, “It just feels like something that didn’t have to happen.”\n\nWarren grieving the loss of her brother from a distance has become both familiar and identifiable in a pandemic with nearly 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 88,000 deaths. In recent weeks, Warren has joined President Trump, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) as top political figures with family members or friends who’ve been directly affected by the pandemic.\n\nWhile it’s unclear how Herring contracted the coronavirus, The Washington Post’s Annie Linskey and Felicia Sonmez reported that he had been in a rehabilitation center where several other people had active cases of the virus.\n\nWarren, who would often tell anecdotes of Herring’s military service during her presidential campaign, recounted how her brother was ready to leave the rehab facility when he was told he was not allowed to exit after learning someone had tested positive for the virus.\n\n“I called him every day for 11 days, and every day he would say, ‘I’m just fine,’ ” she said to the Atlantic. “In fact, he said, ‘I think I probably had it before and I’m just too tough and didn’t even notice.’ ”\n\nBut when his own coronavirus test came back positive, Warren said it felt like she couldn’t breathe.\n\n“And he said, ‘Bets’ — he’d call me Bets or Betsy always — ‘I feel fine. I feel fine,’ ” she said. She added, “He’d tell me, ‘Oh, it’s fine,’ and laugh. And he was irritated that he couldn’t leave. And I had begun to think, This is okay. We’re going to get him out of there.”\n\nThat’s when his condition took a turn. After he didn’t answer his phone, Warren found out that Herring was in intensive care. She said she spoke to him once again on the phone. His speech was slurred and he was confined to a bed but remained optimistic. He passed away shortly thereafter.\n\nSince her brother’s death, Warren has underscored the urgency for the country to prepare for a second potential wave of the virus in the fall. During last week’s Senate hearing, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed with Warren’s assessment, saying “there would be problems” in regard to another outbreak later this year if testing and contact tracing doesn’t improve and if social distancing doesn’t continue.\n\nOn Sunday, Warren acknowledged to the Atlantic that the feelings her and tens of thousands of American families who’ve lost loved ones to the coronavirus share was “something none of us were prepared for.”\n\n“It’s always hard to lose someone you love,” she said. “But to lose someone when you have to wonder: What were their last days like? Were they afraid? Were they cold? Were they lonely? That is a kind of grief that is new to all of us.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 957059, "name": "Judith Martin"}, "body": "Dear Miss Manners: A year ago, a paper of mine was chosen for publication in my college's undergraduate research journal, but publication was postponed until the fall issue due to a \"heavy workload.\" I told the publication office that I was graduating in June and gave them my address so that they could send me the fall issue with my article once it was published.\n In early December, I asked when I should expect to receive it. The response, two days later, was that \"due to leadership changes and executive decisions in between school years,\" my article was postponed until the winter issue, and that I would receive a copy in the mail once it was published.\n In March, I received an invitation to the launch party for the winter issue, which finally includes my article. I responded that I would be unable to attend, since I had graduated and am no longer in the area. Even though they already had my address, I gave it to them again just in case.\n Then came the shelter-in-place orders in my state due to coronavirus, with college students being asked to leave campus. I know this must be a stressful time for all college students. But since responding to the invitation, I have heard no response nor received my copy in the mail.\n With the pandemic going on, would it be selfish of me to ask them when I can expect my copy? I don't want to come across as insensitive, but also feel that they have treated me quite poorly throughout this whole process. It seems as if they should have had plenty of time to mail my copy, since they had my address and had repeatedly promised to do so.\n As you are well aware, the issue was finished before the pandemic shut things down. But as you have also noticed, it now looks heartless to complain about any non-emergency work that did not get done.\n Miss Manners suspects that a side effect of the pandemic will be the use of this all-purpose excuse in matters that are entirely unrelated to the crisis. Obligations that should have been met, or still could be, will be swept in with lapses that were serious and unavoidable.\n So you needn’t feel selfish about asking. But now you may encounter a real excuse: lack of access to the office where the issues are kept. A restrained reminder would be best, asking how or when you can obtain the journal, as you did not receive it when it was published last year.\n Dear Miss Manners: If a person is a \"Jr.,\" do they continue to use \"Jr.\" after the \"Sr.\" has died?\n The rule is that when the first who is so named dies, everyone moves up. “Junior” is dropped, unless there is a III, who would then become Junior.\n The exception is when the original name-holder is so distinguished that there might be confusion. If George Washington had had a son with the same name — he did not — the son would have continued to be G.W.

But the Premier League has government backing to pursue restarting games in June if there is no new spike in COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\nSunday should have been the last day of the season but, instead of Liverpool completing a title triumph, coronavirus testing was taking place at clubs.\n\nUp to 40 players and coaches at each club were due to be tested for the coronavirus across Sunday and Monday. A further wave of testing will take place across the 20 clubs later in the week in a bid to detect infections.\n\nIn recent weeks, players have only been carrying out some individual fitness work on fields at some training grounds. But the socially distant team training could start on Tuesday if the protocols are agreed on by executives from the clubs during their latest “Project Restart” conference call on Monday.\n\nContact training would be prohibited until approval is granted by the government, which has said games could resume in June — without fans in stadiums.\n\nSome players and managers have expressed concern about returning to training since Britain has Europe’s highest virus death toll as well as the most confirmed cases.\n\n“You’d need a full four to five weeks (training), especially if you’re going to go back into competition, when you’re literally paid to win,” Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling said in a YouTube interview with United States captain Megan Rapinoe. “You do need to do that preparation. You can’t just go straight in.”\n\nThe aspiration of resuming the league in the week beginning June 8 now appears hard to achieve. Liverpool led the league by 25 points with nine games remaining when the season was paused in March.\n\nEngland’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said last week they will assess how the phased return of training goes before they “even think about moving on to the return of competitive football matches. We have to be slow. We have to be measured.”\n\nBritain reported on Sunday that 170 more people have died from the coronavirus, raising its overall death toll to 34,636. It is the lowest daily death toll since the day after the country’s lockdown was announced on March 23, although weekend figures are usually lower because reporting lags when compared with weekdays.\n\nAnother 3,142 people in Britain tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the number of total confirmed cases to 243,303.\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1388773, "name": "Terence Mcardle"}, "body": "Hunter, whose apartment was adorned with Redskins and Nationals memorabilia, died of covid-19 on April 17 at 94. She came to the District in 1944 as a government girl — the young women who arrived to work for federal agencies during World War II, many of them from small towns like her birthplace, Apollo, Penn.\n\nShe arrived in the District while escorting another Apollo girl whose parents did not want her to live alone in the big city. Both women took the civil service exam. However, after two years, the friend who had begged Ruth to leave Apollo returned to Pennsylvania. Hunter continued at the Pentagon and lived the next eight decades in the District, mostly in the U Street neighborhood.\n\nShe worked as a secretary for Gen. Omar Bradley while he chaired the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. Perhaps because of her security clearance or maybe just her small town humility, she rarely spoke about her work. However, she did keep pictures from her time as a batter on a Pentagon women’s softball team.\n\nHunter never married and she outlived all four of her siblings. In many ways, the church was her extended family.\n\n“She was a strong, wonderful, feisty woman who was like a grandmother or aunt to many people there,” said Wilbert Miller, a former pastor at Augustana from 1982 to 1995.\n\nHunter organized the scripture readings, compiled a lengthy prayer list and also was quick to tell the organist if she thought the music was too loud.\n\nBut she was best known for an altruism that showed in ways both large and small. When one woman went through a difficult pregnancy, Hunter presented her with a piggy bank for her baby. Miller recalled that she once took a homeless woman under her wing and helped her find work and housing. She was also active in the Lydians, a group of professional women within the church who contributed their earnings to pressing community needs.\n\nIn later years, Hunter, who didn’t drive and prided herself on thrift, rode with other congregants to church. The money she saved on bus fare went directly to the church.\n\nShe began attending Augustana in 1948 and joined the church membership in the late 1950s. It was a period when members proselytized door to door, inviting all without a church of their own to come worship. At the time, the congregants were primarily white while the surrounding neighborhood was predominantly African American.\n\n“The church made the decision to integrate,” said Miller. “That was an amazing thing at the time. It was famously known [within the church] as ‘Operation One Mile’ — to do a circle of people within one mile. Here is this young woman from Apollo and she jumps in with both feet to that congregation and its ministry.”\n\nIn 1964, Hunter became active in the Girl Scouts, serving as troop leader to an all-black Brownie troop. As the girls grew into women, she stayed in touch, sharing in their experiences of family and work. One of them later became her eye doctor.\n\n“When I was there, she was always open to others,” Miller recalled. “When AIDS raised its ugly head, the church became very open to the LGBT community, then we had a ministry for the Salvadoran community. She was very open to all of those ministries.”\n\nIn recent years, Hunter lived at the Residences at Thomas Circle — initially in independent living, then, as her Alzheimer’s disease progressed, in the facility’s memory-care unit.\n\nOn the evening of April 24, several congregants got together on Zoom to eulogize and reminisce about their longtime friend.\n\n“When we are able to come together again as a church,” congregant Barbara Capps said, “there will be a real memorial service for Ruth.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Bolton"}, "body": "His grandmother, Marian Briefel, died on April 14 at White Oak Adventist Medical Center from complications of covid-19. She was 90.\n\nA longtime Silver Spring resident, her family described her as a kind and caring woman who readily took in relatives and friends at various times due to need or circumstance. Her son, Ken A. Briefel, recalled that his mom made their home a welcoming one where his friends felt comfortable visiting.\n\nMarian Briefel’s son said she was married for 64 years to his late father, Harold. They did most everything together, such as  cooking, entertaining friends and traveling, but really, mah-jongg was “the thing” that gave her joy, Ken Briefel said.\n\nBriefel started working in the purchasing department at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring in the late 1960s and later became the department manager. Many of the colleagues and vendors Marian worked with at Holy Cross contacted the family after hearing of her passing and shared touching stories, according to her son. A female colleague told him that his mother took her under her wing as a young woman and helped to lay out her a path to retirement at 62. The women shared a love of fine clothing and jewelry.\n\nEven in her assisted-living facility at Riderwood in Silver Spring, Marian dressed nicely and pampered herself with weekly manicures and visits to the hair salon, her son said.\n\nMarian Briefel also had a daughter, Gail; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nDaughter-in-law Ronette Briefel was the last family member to see Marian Briefel in person before she died. That was March 14. The following day, her son went to visit, but signs at the Riderwood gates denied visitors from entering the facility.\n\nHer family was able to see her a few times on FaceTime before she died on a Tuesday. By Wednesday evening, her son said, about a dozen family members “gathered” to share memories on Zoom.\n\nShe and her husband bought funeral plots years ago at Judean Memorial Gardens Cemetery with another couple, who lived down the road from them for 40 years. After Marian Briefel was buried in a service friends and family watched on Zoom, she was reunited with her husband and her neighbors.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6-6", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6"}, "score": 0.22, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "IAB6", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6", "parent": null}, "score": 0.18, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": false, "id": "02001007", "level": 3, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/02001007", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/02001000"}, "score": 0.07, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 2191, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[53, 57]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"}, "score": 0.9991124868392944, "text": "White", "types": ["Items", "Disease"]}, {"indices": [[1186, 1192]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewellery"}, "score": 0.9997122287750244, "text": "jewelry", "types": ["PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[1482, 1488]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Ronettes"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "Ronette", "types": ["Group", "Band", "Organisation", "Agent"]}, {"indices": [[824, 830]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manager_(association_football)"}, "score": 0.4503405690193176, "text": "manager", "types": ["SoccerClub"]}, {"indices": [[1208, 1231]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assisted_living"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "assisted-living facility", "types": ["Facility", "ArchitecturalStructure"]}, {"indices": [[1895, 1898], [2133, 2136]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reverse-Flash"}, "score": 0.5170426368713379, "text": "Zoom", "types": ["Name", "Person", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[1759, 1766]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/FaceTime"}, "score": 0.9964762926101685, "text": "FaceTime", "types": ["Work", "Product", "Software", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[144, 156], [760, 772], [1249, 1261]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silver_Spring,_Maryland"}, "score": 0.9946851134300232, "text": "Silver Spring", "types": ["City", "Settlement", "Area", "Place", "PopulatedPlace", "Location"]}, {"indices": [[617, 625]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mahjong"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "mah-jongg", "types": ["VideoGame", "Product", "Activity", "Game"]}, {"indices": [[723, 732], [813, 822]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France"}, "score": 0.9990658164024353, "text": "department", "types": ["SportsLeague", "Levels"]}, {"indices": [[1352, 1356]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salon_(gathering)"}, "score": 0.8923691511154175, "text": "salon", "types": ["Convention", "Gathering", "PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[110, 117]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus_disease_2019"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "covid-19", "types": ["Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[1236, 1244], [1652, 1660]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Riderwood", "types": ["Place", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[17, 30], [433, 446], [1374, 1387], [1532, 1545], [2064, 2077]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Marian Briefel", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[317, 330]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Ken A.

His case was complicated by multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.\n\nSlater left WETA in 1989 and ran his own consulting business. Halcy Bohen, his wife since 1987, said Slater was a central figure in a large family that included his two children, three stepdaughters and nine grandchildren. In later years Bohen said he enjoyed taking the grandchildren on trips across the world — China, Ghana, Italy, England.\n\n“He was absolutely a joy to grandparent with,” Bohen said.\n\nBut he suffered declining health and in October had moved to Ingleside at Rock Creek, a retirement community where he could receive care for dementia. When the virus outbreak began, Bohen, who had also moved to the community, said she and Slater were separated in different parts of the facility. The last time she saw him in person was March 13.\n\nThe virus took his life in just a few days after he fell ill in April. His family gathered via screen to be there for his final moments.\n\nHaving grown up in the Bronx and never losing the borough’s distinctive accent, Slater began in the television business while an undergraduate at New York University, working as an usher for CBS.\n\nSlater became an acolyte of Fred Friendly, a president of CBS, and part of a group committed to building a public alternative to commercial television.\n\nAfter the Watergate hearings helped establish public television’s reputation for delivering public affairs programming, Slater joined PBS member station WETA in 1975, beginning a long partnership with Ward Chamberlin, the station’s chief executive. They overhauled what was then a small station, playing off its position in the national capital to tap resources such as those at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n“We wanted it to be straight and we wanted it to be believable and trustworthy,” said Linda Winslow, whom Slater hired to WETA in 1978. He promoted her to a senior role in public affairs, the kind of job few women held in television at the time.\n\nSharon Rockefeller, who took over the leadership of WETA after the two departed, credited them with laying a foundation that has positioned the station today as the second biggest producer of public television content.\n\n“We had no financial base but it was about location, location, location,” said Rockefeller, who was a board member at the station in the early ‘70s.\n\nWhere Chamberlin was averse to conflict, Slater took it on. He could be blunt with people but without alienating them: As one former colleague put it to Bohen, he was a “sheep in wolf’s clothing.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level":

Eventually treated like a human diorama by the tourists who traveled to peer at them through the glass triangles of their quarters, the terrestrial astronauts (terranauts?) who volunteered to sequester themselves in a collection of seven mini-biomes were tarred as a naive cult at best, and charlatans at worst.\n “Spaceship Earth” helpfully deconstructs those accusations, first by delving into the project’s origins in 1960s San Francisco, when a charismatic Oklahoma transplant named John Allen gathered a group of bookish, artistically inclined young people to get things going, whether in the form of experimental plays, a farm in New Mexico or an oceangoing ship that they built from scratch in Oakland, Calif. After sailing the world, learning about global warming and attracting the attention and money of oil scion and environmentalist Ed Bass, Allen hit upon the idea of launching an earthbound test of what might eventually be a colony on Mars or the moon.\n Luckily for us, Allen and his colleagues were compulsive recorders of their adventures, and one of the Biospherians, a physician named Roy Walford, brought a video camera into the complex. With a wealth of archival material to work with, Wolf does a superb job of sending viewers back into the 1980s and 1990s — whose scratchy, juddering VHS-era production values and “Galaxy Quest”-worthy uniforms might be tough on the eyes, but are note-perfect in conjuring the time period. He also interviews as many surviving participants as he can, giving “Spaceship Earth” a welcome note of self-awareness and perspective (although no one addresses the conspicuous homogeneity of the group). Anyone who fears going stir crazy at a time when going to the store is more akin to scrubbing in for surgery than running a light errand will relate when tensions rise and systems begin to break down; if the Biospherians’ two-year sojourn in the Arizona desert proved anything, it might be just how much a whiff of fresh air can do.\n There’s a third-act twist involving a present-day political figure that is so shocking, and strangely prescient, that divulging the details wouldn’t be sporting. Suffice it to say that, in addition to celebrating the energy, enterprise and idealism of America’s postwar generation, “Spaceship Earth” provides a sobering primer in how some dreams die, and others are strangled mercilessly in their cribs.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB25-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB25-3",

He was working from home during the pandemic and studying the virus, his supervisor said, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nOfficials told the newspaper that Liu was shot by another man and suffered gunshot wounds to the head, neck, torso and extremities. The man, later identified as 46-year-old Hao Gu, then got into his car about 100 yards away and killed himself.\n\nNeighbors told the paper that they didn’t hear any gunshots the day Liu was killed.\n\nThe front and rear patio doors of Liu’s home were open at the time of his death because of the springtime weather, the Post-Gazette reported. His wife wasn’t home at that time.\n\nNo items were stolen from the home, according to the paper.\n\nRoss Township Det. Brian Kohlhepp told WTAE that police don’t believe the relationship between the two men had anything to do with Liu’s research on the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt is unclear how the two men knew each other, and police are investigating whether there was any confrontation before the incident. A possible motive for the murder is also unclear, the Post-Gazette reported.\n\nIn a statement, Liu’s department at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine called him a prolific researcher and generous mentor. Shortly before his death, he had begun researching the cellular mechanisms that underlie coronavirus infections and the cellular basis of ensuing complications.\n\nIvet Bahar, his supervisor and the head of his department, told the Post-Gazette that Liu had just started to receive interesting results.\n\nBahar had sent several emails to Liu over the weekend about his work and was surprised that the normally prompt researcher wasn’t responding, according to the Post-Gazette.\n\nAfter a conversation with a colleague about the crime, she confirmed Liu was the victim, the paper reported. He had not expressed any fear for his life to her, she told the paper.\n\n“We will make an effort to complete what he started in an effort to pay homage to his scientific excellence,” the statement said.\n\nLiu and his wife had no children and mostly kept to themselves, neighbors told the Post-Gazette.\n\nLiu received his bachelor’s and doctoral degrees from the National University of Singapore, according to his professional website. He had previously worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the department of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and with Bahar as a research associate in the department of computational and systems biology at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\n\nThroughout his career, he published more than 30 academic papers and wrote a book.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

He laid low for three weeks between late January and February and was not seen on state media for another 13 days between the middle and end of February.\n\nKim Byung-kee said the North Korean leader has made only 17 public appearances this year, compared with an average of 50 over the same period in previous years, which the NIS linked to a possible coronavirus outbreak in North Korea.\n\nAlthough North Korea’s government insists it has no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, it has repeatedly emphasized the threat to the country from the disease it causes, covid-19.\n\nThe NIS said the virus could have entered the country from China before the border between the two countries was closed in late January.\n\n“It cannot be ruled out that there has been an outbreak in North Korea,” Kim Byung-kee said. “Kim Jong Un had focused on consolidating internal affairs such as military forces and party-state meetings, and coronavirus concerns have further limited his public activity.”\n\nThe NIS said the prolonged closure of the border has added to the economic hardships of North Korean people and temporarily pushed up the price of imports such as spices and sugar, as well as the dollar’s exchange rate against the local currency.\n\nThat, in turn, caused an outbreak of panic buying among Pyongyang residents, it said, which provided more fuel for the rumor mill surrounding the health of the nuclear-armed dictator.\n\nSince then, authorities have cracked down on hoarding and stepped up emergency food imports, allowing prices to more or less stabilize, the NIS said.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no sign of a slowdown in North Korea’s efforts to improve its missile defense capability, with weapons tests continuing at a rapid pace this year.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies released satellite images Tuesday of a new facility near Pyongyang Sunan International Airport that it said is “almost certainly related to North Korea’s expanding ballistic missile program.”\n\nOne building within the facility is large enough to accommodate an elevated Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile “and, therefore, the entirety of North Korea’s known ballistic missile variants,” it said.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-20", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

But Army officials said the students must return for final medical checks, equipment and training.\n\n“We can’t telecommute to combat,” Gen. James McConville, the chief of staff of the Army, told Pentagon reporters when asked about the decision, which forces cadets spread out across the U.S. to travel, risking exposure on public transportation, and then land in New York, a coronavirus hot spot.\n\nCadets have been home since spring break in March, with their return to school delayed because of the outbreak. Only the seniors will return, and the graduation is set for June 13.\n\nLt. Gen. Darryl Williams, academy superintendent, said the students must return for medical and other required tasks that can only be done at the academy before they can be turned over as new officers to the Army.\n\nHe said the school will create a “safety bubble” around the cadets and build a staging base where they will arrive. All cadets will be screened and tested for the virus at the staging area and then separated into five groups that will eat and live separately. They will be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nWilliams said Keller Army Community Hospital at the base now has all the needed testing equipment, and was converted to be able to handle and quarantine virus patients.\n\nAsked if cadets will face discipline if they can’t or don’t want to come back because of the virus, he said commanders will decide on a case-by-case basis.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a member of West Point’s Board of Visitors, said she expressed her concerns about the decision to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy in a call this week.\n\n“Trump’s reckless decision to gather 1,000 Cadets at West Point for a speech puts our future military leaders at increased risk — all to stroke his own ego,” said Duckworth, a retired Army helicopter pilot, who served in the Iraq war and received a Purple Heart.\n\nMcCarthy told reporters the Army wants to have a “small, safe graduation ceremony” for the cadets to celebrate.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. Naval Academy has announced it will hold a virtual graduation and postpone other traditional milestone events until large-scale gatherings are allowed. The academy’s superintendent, Vice Adm. Sean Buck, called it a difficult decision but necessary “to safeguard the health and welfare of the entire Naval Academy family and local community.”\n\nThe U.S. Air Force Academy opted to hold a scaled-down ceremony with hundreds of graduating cadets sitting in chairs eight feet apart on the school’s parade field, instead of in its stadium. The ceremony was closed to visitors.\n\nWest Point’s graduation ceremonies are usually held in May in a football stadium.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Duggan"}, "body": "“Going to two games in one day was not unheard of,” his son Tom Jackman recalled.\n\nYou could say he enjoyed music, too. He sang throughout his life, as a boy in a church choir in Massachusetts; as a student in the University of Notre Dame Glee Club; and as a tenor in the Oratorio Society of Washington, now the Washington Chorus, which performs at the Kennedy Center and other such lofty venues. Though he came of age with rock-and-roll in the 1950s, he preferred the jazz of Dave Brubeck, Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan.\n\n“He went to the Newport Jazz Festival many times,” said the younger Jackman, a reporter for The Washington Post, “not to mention far less savory jazz joints.”\n\nWilliam E. “Bill” Jackman, 84, a retired press spokesman who loved to travel the world with his wife of 60 years, died this week in an assisted-living facility in Reston, Va., after testing positive for covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. As of Thursday, the death toll from the weeks-old pandemic was approaching 1,300 in Virginia, Maryland and the District.\n\nTom Jackman said his father, who had Alzheimer’s disease and was in declining health generally in recent years, was tested for the illness last Friday at Great Falls Assisted Living. On Monday, the facility told his family that the test was positive. “But they said he seemed okay, that he’s just got a cough,” the son said.\n\nThat night, “he died in his sleep.”\n\nBill Jackman lived in Reston, grew up in the village of Whitinsville, about 50 miles from Boston, and graduated from Notre Dame in 1956 with a degree in journalism. For a few years, he edited a small newspaper in California’s Mojave Desert, then entered the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Va. Around that time, he met a young Virginia woman named Sigrid Stanley, who was studying at Mary Washington University in nearby Fredericksburg.\n\n“It was a big deal that she married a Yankee,” Tom Jackman said of his mother. He said each family had trouble understanding the other’s accent.\n\nOver the years, the couple’s travels included trips to China, India, Kenya, Australia and Brazil. They had two sons and a daughter.\n\nFor about 23 years starting in the mid-1960s, Bill Jackman, who left the Marines as a captain, was a spokesman for the airline industry’s trade association, now called Airlines for America. Later, until he retired in the mid-2000s, he was national spokesman for AAA.\n\n“If you know me or my brother, you knew him, because he passed his passions directly to us,” Tom Jackman said.\n\nSports, for instance: Besides being an avid spectator, Bill Jackman was the public address announcer — the stadium voice — of U.S. Navy Academy football for three decades. In the 1960s, he was also the basketball public address announcer and part-time sports information director at Georgetown University. “His first task every morning was to read the sports section of The Post,” his son said.\n\nHe also established “the Jackman family tradition of sprinting to the car right before the end of a game to beat the traffic,” Tom Jackman recalled. He remembered his father’s voice, yelling: “Come on, Tommy! It’s a school night!”\n\n“I hated leaving even a minute early,” he said. “But chasing him in the Cap Centre parking lot is a custom I have now passed on to my own sons.”", "categories": [{"confident":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1069831, "name": "Norman Leahy"}, "body": "Sonya Ravindranath Waddell, a vice president and economist who heads up the Richmond Fed’s regional economics group, said in an email that the more than 28,000 jobs Virginians lost in March were “the largest one-month drop in absolute terms since [they began measuring the data in] 1939 and the largest percentage drop since January 2009.” \n\nWaddell said about half of the March drop was from the “leisure and hospitality sector,” bolstering the dire picture from the National Restaurant Association.\n\nBut again, that was just part of the bigger, bleaker, picture.\n\n“Well over 400,000 people have filed for unemployment in Virginia in the last 4 weeks,” Waddell said. “For some context, we had a little over 117,000 unemployed in February.” \n\n“From those employment numbers,” she said, “it is clear that the shutdowns/stay-at-home orders have affected Virginia businesses.” \n\nUnsurprisingly, business confidence has dropped. But Waddell said despite the gloom, “only a small percentage of the firms that we talk to are currently worried about solvency.” \n\nBusinesses’ bigger worries are “about cash flow or customer demand,” Waddell said, adding “they report that they are not on the brink of permanently closing yet.” \n\nGiven all this, Virginia’s economy is going to take a hit. But Waddell says we’ll have to wait several weeks before we know just how deep the damage has been.\n\n“First quarter Virginia GDP will not be released until July 7,” Waddell said, “and even that, as we know, will not tell a big part of the story — we will have to wait for second quarter GDP for that.” \n\nThis data is important because it helps the Northam administration create the revenue projections upon which the state budget rests.\n\nAnd we all know the projections used to create the $135 billion budget passed in March are little more than fiction.\n\nThe Richmond Feds’s Joseph Mengedoth, an associate regional economist who analyzes state and local budgets, said in an email that rising unemployment, business closures and lower tax receipts all mean big hits to the state budget.\n\nBut the blow could be worse for localities, many of which, Mengedoth said, “levy additional sales and meals taxes on top of the state rate to fund their budgets — schools, in particular.” \n\nWhat might Virginia’s employment market look like in the months ahead? Waddell said that was a difficult question to answer. \n\n“This is a health crisis, so presumably, the productive capacity of the economy was not affected and when this started,” she said.\n\nPre-lockdowns, “we were at a record tight labor market in the U.S. and in Virginia,” Waddell said.\n\nBut she added, “the longer this goes on, the more likely we will affect productive capacity — firms could shutter and the long-term unemployed are much less likely to be re-employed than the short-term unemployed.”\n\nAs for when Virginia’s economy might get back to something resembling normal, Waddell said that’s hard to predict. But she believes “economic activity will not resume completely normally for a while.” \n\n“That matters,” she said, “for long-term employment trends,” because even if Virginia snaps back to its pre-shutdown level of activity, getting those lost jobs back won’t be easy.\n\n“From July 2007 to February 2010,” Waddell said, “the Virginia unemployment rate rose from 3.0 to 7.5 and it took until 2018 to get back to 3.0 percent.” \n\nThe strong desire of Virginians to return to normal is understandable. But returning to the way things were before the coronavirus pandemic may take years. If they comes back at all.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3-12", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB3-12", "parent":

In March, health officials there linked two Feb. 26 deaths to covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nYet, the Santa Clara County fatalities still push the toll of the virus back by weeks.\n\n“The fact that there were deaths related to covid back in early February is very significant because it means the virus was around for a lot longer than was initially realized,” Jeff Smith, a physician and the county executive in Santa Clara, told The Washington Post. “It’s been around for a while and it’s probably been spreading in the community for quite some time.”\n\nIt is not yet known exactly how the two people became infected, but Sara Cody, the county’s public health officer, told The Post that the cases are believed to be community transmissions.\n\n“From what I understand, we don’t know of any travel history,” Cody, who is also a doctor, said of the individuals. “More investigation will be done to try and confirm that that’s the case.”\n\nThe connection between the February deaths and coronavirus did not become apparent until now due to strict limitations on testing at the time, Cody said.\n\nBoth of the California deaths occurred when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tightly restricted tests to people with a known travel history and specific symptoms, according to Tuesday’s release. Tests on the victims could not be performed until the medical examiner performed autopsies.\n\n“We did have a very uncomfortable feeling that we were missing cases because we didn’t have the tests to be able to confirm,” Cody said. “This tells us that yes, we were definitely missing cases.”\n\nThese two fatalities, along with a third on March 6, also indicate that the coronavirus was likely spreading earlier and further in the San Francisco Bay area than previously thought.\n\nAs Cody explains it, each severe covid-19 case or death “represent tips of icebergs of unknown size.”\n\n“Every time when I see someone in the ICU or someone who dies, what that says to me is that represents many more infections,” she said.\n\nSanta Clara County’s first locally transmitted case of the virus was reported on Feb. 28, in 68-year old Azar Ahrabi, who later became the region’s first known death on March 9.\n\nBut test results for the two February deaths show that the coronavirus had in fact killed others in the county, which includes the city of San Jose as well as Silicon Valley, weeks before Ahrabi died.\n\nThe Bay Area became an early hotspot for the virus at the beginning of March, when reported cases were in the double-digits and outbreaks were believed to be mostly concentrated on the West Coast.\n\nSo far, Santa Clara County has tallied 88 coronavirus-related deaths, including five new deaths reported Tuesday. The county now has 1,946 confirmed cases. \n\nEarlier this year, a genetic analysis of virus samples found that the virus may have also spread undetected for weeks in Washington state, which reported the country’s first two deaths.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-15", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7-15", "parent":

A spokesman for D.C. Public Schools said he is the system’s first confirmed employee to die of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. He is survived by his wife, five daughters, four stepchildren and eight grandchildren.\n\nMakumbi was a 25-year veteran of the school system and ended his career at Houston Elementary in Ward 7.\n\n“He loved his job so much, I think he would have worked until he was in his eighties and nineties,” said Florie L. Matondo, his eldest daughter. “He loved studying behavior — that’s what he kept telling me. Because human beings, he said, were the most complicated things.”\n\nMakumbi’s winding path to becoming a school psychologist spanned two continents and five decades. He was born in what is now known as Congo, the son of Angolan refugees. He was a psychology major in college and taught Angolan high school refugees in Congo. He and his uncle Sebastian Pinto were “freedom fighters” in the 1970s, pushing for Angola’s independence from Portugal.\n\nThen Makumbi became a top Angolan education official in Congo, where many refugees lived, said Pinto.\n\nMakumbi later became chief of staff for a General Motors factory in Congo. He helped children secure scholarships, and when he coudn’t, he used his salary to pay their tuitions himself.\n\nIn 1983, General Motors recruited Makumbi to work in a Michigan factory. He moved to the United States. After the factory closed, his daughter said, he decided to pursue his dream of becoming a psychologist. He earned his PhD at Howard University.\n\nPinto said he’s not surprised that his nephew returned to education.\n\n“He loved people, and he loved to educate people,” Pinto said.  “He felt people are the same everywhere.”\n\nHis colleagues remembered Makumbi as kind, well-read and opinionated. He debated everything, they said, from local education politics to international relations to what he viewed as the follies of standardized exams.\n\nDarryl Webster, a social worker at Houston Elementary, who shared an office with Makumbi for six years, said the psychological assessments he compiled for students were longer and more thorough than any Webster had seen. Watching Makumbia break down the assessments in a way that parents could understand was, Webster said, “poetry.”\n\nIf Makumbi couldn’t get in touch with parents, he and Webster would drive to their homes. One mother said that Makumbi would help her daughter with school work, even though that wasn’t his job.\n\nWebster said Makumbi saw himself in many of the low-income black children he served and believed it was his mission to help them access a high-quality education.\n\nHe recalled witnessing Makumbi giving a young boy an assessment — an interaction that Webster said showed the potential that Makumbi saw in each student, no matter what any test may say.\n\nThe boy was frustrated, unable to answer any of the questions Mukambi presented him.\n\n“C’mon child, c’mon child, you can do it,” Makumbi said as he patted the boy on the head. “I believe in you. You can do it.” \n\nHe suggested the boy get some water. When he returned, Makumbi asked if the boy was ready.\n\n“Well then, let’s get at it,” he said.\n\nThey completed the test. When the student left, Webster asked Makumbi how he fared.\n\n“That boy’s a genius,” he said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

He remained Manafort’s right-hand man when Manafort served as campaign chairman until that August. Gates was a key government cooperator and gave Mueller’s office “ample basis” to investigate coordination between the campaign and Russia or possible obstruction of justice, Jackson said.\n\nGates remained with the Trump campaign after the election, worked for the Republican National Committee and was deputy chairman of the Trump inaugural committee.\n\nSeparately, Manafort, 71, is awaiting a response to his April 13 request to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for release to home confinement to serve the rest of his 7 ½-year sentence. His lawyers said his age and health put him at “high risk” of contracting the coronavirus.\n\nManafort is serving a term due to end in November 2024, at the Loretto federal prison in central Pennsylvania, a low-security facility with an adjacent ­minimum-security camp.\n\nManafort was convicted in 2018 of bank and tax fraud, witness tampering and conspiring to defraud the United States.\n\nManafort has high blood pressure and liver disease, his lawyers said. He also contracted influenza and bronchitis in February, and in December he was hospitalized for several days for a heart condition, his lawyers said.\n\nThey asked that he be released to live with

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2491331, "name": "Rachel Lerman"}, "body": "Once somewhat niche, meditation apps such as Headspace, Calm and Ten Percent Happier have seen a surge in usage in the past month — so much so that they are launching new features weekly and partnering with local governments to meet demand. Much like recent videoconferencing standout Zoom, these apps are also having to deal with an unprecedented spike in users as more people search for ways to stay occupied inside.\n\nDownloads for “mindfulness” apps hit 750,000 during the week of March 29, a 25 percent increase from the weekly average in January and February, according to mobile insights and analytics platform App Annie. Android users also spent about 85 percent more time using those apps that week than usual.\n\nMeditation is often thought of as a solitary activity, a way to sit alone and feel centered. But in this era of isolation, people are using it as a way to feel a sense of togetherness with other people, even if it’s just virtually.\n\nVicki Overfelt, the founder of Mindfulness Utah, was diagnosed with covid-19 last month. As she recovered, she tuned back in to her meditation communities, which by then had moved online. Soon she was meditating virtually on calls with more than 3,000 people.\n\nIt makes sense that people have turned to something that grounds them in an uncertain time, she said.\n\n“It’s easy to get caught up in the existential angst of it all, and meditation helps us understand and work with the overwhelming stress,” she said.\n\nMost meditation apps offer short daily recordings to help people relax and find peace, even if just for a few minutes every day. The apps have new guided meditation recordings daily and often offer recordings ranging from three minutes to 30 minutes. They also have training courses to learn to, say, reduce stress or even get in some brief exercise.\n\nIncreasingly, the apps are offering live classes, where a mindfulness instructor and sometimes celebrity guests take viewers through a meditation session and then answer questions at the end. Live commenting features and the QAs help people feel connected, instructors say.\n\nHeadspace, an app that offers daily guided meditation sessions, said downloads of its app have doubled since mid-March. And people are using its live meditation feature — where people join a guided meditation all together at a scheduled time — 70 percent more frequently than usual.\n\n“I think we are craving human connection and shared stories more than ever,” Headspace CEO Richard Pierson said.\n\nAt the (virtual) headquarters for meditation app Ten Percent Happier, helmed by ABC News correspondent Dan Harris, the 30-person team has been doing a “monumental” amount of work to keep up with the increase in customers, Harris said. The number of monthly downloads has doubled since mid-March, he said.\n\nThe company released a free “coronavirus sanity guide” to help people deal with stress and made the app free for more than 25,000 health-care workers so far.\n\nIts daily live guided meditation sessions are attracting thousands of participants. Even after the live session has ended, people are choosing to listen to its recording instead of other options in the app.\n\n“People are deriving a sense of community from it,” Harris said.\n\nBlaire Gearhart, a banker in Griffith, Ind., was a meditation skeptic until she started using Headspace to calm herself before a surgery this year. Now, she uses it after especially stressful days at work — a common occurrence now that so many people are concerned about their personal finances.\n\n“It’s been a really great way for me to just take the weight off of my shoulders,” she said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB14-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB14-5",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2508513, "name": "Ian Shapira;michael E. Miller"}, "body": "James Hartman, the sheriff’s deputy office’s spokesman, said earlier that day, a relative was communicating with Norwood and became concerned about his well-being. The relative then called the sheriff’s office and requested that deputies conduct a welfare check at the Norwood residence. An official cause of death will not be declared until an autopsy is completed, Hartman said. He declined to offer any additonal details.\n\nThe sudden death marks the latest tragedy in the Norwood family.\n\nLevi, a 17-year-old junior at Liberty High School, has been charged with first-degree murder of his mother Jennifer Norwood, 34, and younger brother Wyatt.\n\n“I knew the phone call was going to come,” one of Josh’s stunned relatives, Cheryl Norwood, wote on Facebook. “I had hoped and begged for it not to... Just know this, I understand why you wanted to go but it doesn’t make it any easier. I love you Joshua. I will never forget or let you be forgotten!”\n\nA little more than a month after the deaths of his wife and son, Norwood filed a petition to restore his right to bear arms. According to his petition, he’d been involuntarily admitted to mandatory outpatient treatment in the Richmond area from March 11 to March 13.  He was scheduled for a hearing on Tuesday in Fauquier County General District Court, but due to concerns about the coronavirus, the proceeding was pushed back to May 11, according to court records and the court clerk.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Washington Post, Norwood described coming home with a bouquet of flowers for his wife at about 6 p.m. on Valentine’s Day. When he opened the door to their brick house on Elk Run Road, he said, his son fired a gunshot at him from the basement, grazing his head. The elder Norwood, who often carried a gun, fired back, and his son fled the house. The father found his wife and youngest son fatally shot and laying under blankets in the living room of their brick home.\n\n“Every day for the rest of my life,” he said, “I’m going to wake up, look in the mirror, and I’m going to have a scar down my face, my head, as a memory of the worst day of my life, when my family got taken away.”\n\nEventually, Levi was tracked down in North Carolina, arrested and returned to Northern Virginia. He is currently being held at a regional juvenile detention center, awaiting trial. It’s unclear how his father’s death will impact Levi’s case. Scott Hook, Fauquier County’s Commonwealth’s Attorney, declined to comment.\n\nIn the aftermath of the killings, Josh had come under scrutiny for his own behavior, facing accusations that he was a racist who objected to his son’s black girlfriend. His Facebook page featured a well-known saying by white supremacist David Lane:  “We must secure the existence of our race, and a future for white children.” The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Lane as “one of the most important ideologues of contemporary white supremacy.”\n\nBut Josh Norwood insisted in an interview with The Post in February that he was not a white supremacist. He claimed he could not remember why he promoted Lane’s maxim on his Facebook multiple times. Levi Norwood’s girlfriend has not returned messages from The Post and her parents’ have declined interview requests.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2508413, "name": "Rachel Lerman"}, "body": "Once somewhat niche, meditation apps like Headspace, Calm and 10 Percent Happier, have seen a surge in usage in the past month — so much so that they are launching new features weekly and partnering with local governments to meet demand. Much like recent video conferencing standout Zoom, these apps are also having to deal with an unprecedented spike in users as more people search for ways to stay occupied inside.\n\nDownloads for so-called mindfulness apps hit 750,000 in the week of March 29, a 25 percent increase from the weekly average in January and February, according to mobile insights and analytics platform App Annie. Android users also spent about 85 percent more time using those apps that week than usual.\n\nMeditation is often thought of as a solitary activity, a way to sit alone and feel centered. But in this era of isolation, people are using it as a way to feel a sense of togetherness with other people, even if it’s just virtually.\n\nVicki Overfelt, the founder of Mindfulness Utah, was diagnosed with covid-19 last month. As she recovered, she tuned back in to her meditation communities, which had by then moved online. Soon she was meditating virtually on calls with more than 3,000 people.\n\nIt makes sense that people have turned to something that grounds them in an uncertain time, she said.\n\n“It’s easy to get caught up in the existential angst of it all and meditation helps us understand and work with the overwhelming stress,” she said.\n\nMost meditation apps offer short daily recordings to help people relax and find peace, even if just for a few minutes every day. The apps have new guided meditation recordings daily, and often offer recordings ranging from 3 minutes to 30 minutes. They also have training courses to learn to, say, reduce stress or even get in some brief exercise.\n\nIncreasingly, the apps are also offering live classes where a mindfulness instructor, and sometimes celebrity guests, take viewers through a meditation session and then answer questions at the end. Live commenting features and the QA’s help people feel connected, instructors say.\n\nHeadspace, an app that offers daily guided meditation sessions, said downloads of its app have doubled since mid-March. And people are using its live meditations feature — where people join a guided meditation all together at a scheduled time — 70% more frequently than usual.\n\n“I think we are craving human connection and shared stories more than ever,” Headspace CEO Richard Pierson said.\n\nAt the (virtual) headquarters for meditation app 10 Percent Happier, helmed by ABC News correspondent Dan Harris, the 30-person team has been doing a “monumental” amount of work to keep up with the increase in customers, Harris said. The number of monthly downloads has doubled since mid-March, he said.\n\nThe company released a free “coronavirus sanity guide” to help people deal with stress, and made the app free for more than 25,000 health care workers so far.\n\nIts daily live guided meditation sessions are attracting thousands of participants — even after the live session has ended, people are choosing to listen to its recording instead of other options in the app.\n\n“People are deriving a sense of community from it,” Harris said.\n\nBlaire Gearhart, a banker in Griffith, Ind., was a meditation skeptic until she started using Headspace to calm herself down before a surgery earlier this year. Now, she uses it after especially stressful days at work — a common occurrence now that so many people are concerned over their personal finances.\n\n“It’s been a really great way for me to just take the weight off of my shoulders,” she said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB14-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB14-5",

It cited a single unidentified source.\n\nThe website, which was set up by North Korean defectors, said Kim had undergone surgery at a hospital in North Korea’s Hyangsan county on April 12, and was still receiving treatment. It said some doctors remained in attendance but others had already returned to Pyongyang.\n\nDiplomats and officials in the region said there were no signs of unusual military activity at the border between North and South Korea, or at North Korean embassies around the world.\n\nThey also said reports about Kim’s health would be top-secret subjects inside North Korea and expressed surprise they could be leaked to U.S. officials.\n\nDaily NK said Kim had been suffering cardiovascular problems since last August, which had been worsened by visits to North Korea’s sacred Mount Paektu late last year. It said Kim had left for the hospital after presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s politburo on April 11.\n\nKim has not been seen in public since then.\n\nOn April 12, Pyongyang fired several short-range missiles. That’s an event Kim might normally have attended, but the test was not reported on state media.\n\nOn April 15, he was not seen at unusually low-key celebrations to mark Kim Il Sung’s official birthday. At the time, experts said that could be because the regime wanted to avoid a huge crowd gathering during a coronavirus pandemic, or even because he was sending a signal about downplaying his grandfather’s legacy. But poor health was always a possibility.\n\nAt the very least, the reports are a reminder of the risks of instability if Kim were to die.\n\n“Kim Jong Un’s poor health and premature death was always a wild card in potential NK scenarios,” tweeted Jung Pak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n“At 36, Kim is obese  has a family history of heart disease. His reported ill health since summer might explain why his sister has been issuing statements in her own name in recent weeks.”\n\nKim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, represented her brother at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, and is thought to be a key confidant of her brother. Last month she issued her first political statements in her own name.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-20", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1220746, "name": "Rebecca Tan"}, "body": "There was nothing that pleased Miller more, said his wife Donna Miller, than seeing the people around him having a good time.\n\nLast week, however, Michael Miller was alone when he was taken to  Southern Maryland Hospital Center in Prince George’s County. He was alone as he struggled against the aggressive coronavirus that has infected thousands in the Washington region and killed more than 800 people. And on April 15, Miller was alone when he died, becoming the first Montgomery County government employee to lose to his life to the disease.\n\n“The hardest part of the whole thing was not being able to see him,” said his mother Jessye Miller, 93. Hours before he died, a nurse put a phone to his ear so that relatives could speak to him.\n\n“We said that we loved him, that we were praying for him, and it was okay to move on,” Jessye Miller said. “That’s the one thing that has helped us all through this. That we were able to say goodbye.”\n\nBorn in Shartlesville, Pa., Miller was a kind but “rambunctious” boy, his mother said, chuckling. He split his childhood between Maryland and Pennsylvania. He later joined the Army and was stationed in Germany.\n\nIn the 1990s, he met Donna and settled down with her in Prince George’s County, where they raised two sons, Joshua and Jonathan, and welcomed three grandchildren. In 2011, he joined the Montgomery County Department of Transportation as a motor pool attendant, which involved checking and maintaining the buses as they came into the depot.\n\nMiller always “had a joke and a giggle” while he was working, said Silver Spring depot chief Andre Lucas, and he didn’t gripe when the hours were long.\n\nEvery year, to prepare for the department’s “Give and Ride Week,” where passengers donate nonperishable food items in exchange for riding for free, Miller would come to the depot the weekend before to personally outfit 140 buses with bags for donations. Miller made it his mission to check the bags throughout the week and diligently collected the donations for area food banks.\n\n“It was his nature,” Lucas said, “to go out of his way.”\n\nOutside work, Miller was heavily involved in the fraternal organizations, Prince Hall Masonry and the Shriners, through which he volunteered at soup kitchens and helped to host charitable events. And when he needed to rest, he would head for the woods — with Donna.\n\n“That was our time,” she said of their camping trips. “To rest, relax, get away from everything.”\n\n\nIn late March, Miller started experiencing symptoms consistent with covid-19 and stopped going to work. He was tested on March 31 and received his test results a week later, but by that time, his condition had significantly deteriorated. He was coughing continuously and had trouble breathing, his wife recalled.\n\n“In 30 years, I had never seen him that sick or that scared,” she said. “Watching him — that was the scariest day I have ever had in my entire life.”\n\nOn April 7, Miller was admitted to a critical care unit, where he died eight days later.\n\nFriends and family say they were taken aback by how rapidly he deteriorated and are unsure where he might have contracted the virus — he had no recent travel history or known contact with anyone who had tested positive for the disease.\n\nFor now, Donna Miller said, she is trying to focus on what mattered to her husband  and assume his role as protective dad to their two sons and three granddaughters. But in the longer term, she isn’t sure how to fill the space he held in her life.\n\n“Frankly, I’m — I’m a little lost right now. I don’t know what I’m going to do without him,” she said.\n\n“He was my source,” she added, “My strength.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

It was a time of turmoil and risk-taking, which suited a man with something new in mind. He cued up the music of home.\n For many of his fellow West Indian immigrants, this was the first time they heard their culture over the air, the sounds of their street parties suddenly granted the prestige of the radio dial. But as fellow broadcaster Francine Chin told the island newspaper the Gleaner recently, other listeners complained about Bailey’s “coconut and banana music.”\n  Bailey was undeterred, a man on a mission. The gregarious DJ with the deep, friendly voice kept playing the music of the Caribbean, Tuesdays through Saturdays, hour after long hour, without ever seeming to tire. As more people listened, New York began to realize the magic that it was hearing. The sense of discovery radiated beyond the city until, by the late 1970s, a profusion of Caribbean genres — reggae, ska, rocksteady — had captured the hearts of listeners around the country (with a hat tip to the brilliant Bob Marley and the Wailers.\n Dubbed the “Godfather of Reggae Radio,” Bailey went silent on Monday in a New York intensive care unit, a victim of covid-19. He was 84.\n Jamaica’s Minister of Culture Olivia Grange marked his passing. “When he just started out,” she said, “no one was playing Jamaican music on radio in America. He came along and changed that. … His contribution to the popularity of reggae music in North America has been immense.”\n  Born in southeastern Jamaica in the village of Airy Castle, Bailey took his big personality to London in his early 20s and made his way into show business. As an emcee at the Cue Club — where the likes of Little Stevie Wonder and Ben E. King made appearances — Bailey connected with the impresario of England’s West Indian diaspora, Count Suckle (born Wilbert Campbell). The Count was already introducing London’s vibrant music scene to reggae and ska in the mid-1960s.\n  [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] \n Perhaps sensing that the same opportunity beckoned across the pond, Bailey moved to New York in 1967 to begin promoting music. Encouraged by his wife Pat — a radio talent in her own right — he rented time on a local station. Husband and wife took turns at the microphone, cooking up an often saucy mix of music, advice, community news — and more music, both secular and sacred. They sold their own ads.\n  Interviewer Dreadless Ras of ZYNC found Bailey still in the studio nearly a half-century later, not long before Pat died in 2016. By then, the Godfather’s five-day-a-week radiothons had been trimmed to a single day: “Nine hours every Saturday, 6 a.m. to 3 p.m.,” the old trouper bragged, adding, “It’s not an easy task.”\n But he was smiling as he said it. Bailey took satisfaction in the ground he opened for Caribbean musicians — and for black broadcasters. “A lot of brothers on the radio say … thanks to me. Because if it wasn’t me, it wouldn’t be them,” he told Ras. And there was no place he would rather be than on the air. “I enjoy what I’m doing,” he said. “If you’re doing something you’re not enjoying, please don’t do it.”\n “Am I wrong or am I right?” Bailey asked.\n His life was his answer.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB1-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB1-6", "parent":

Since the dawn of the current era of superhero cinema, fans could annually look forward to major SDCC announcements from Marvel Studios and DC Entertainment. The two giants would save their biggest news and sneak-peak movie trailers for Saturdays in Comic-Con’s Hall H, considered to be SDCC’s exclamation point. Hall H has lost a little luster recently since Disney’s purchase of Marvel, with D23 now serving as the landing spot for some of the Marvel announcements.\n\nNow that superheroes are part of binge-able shows, major streamers such as Netflix (during its brief union with Marvel) and Amazon (which distributes the raunchy “The Boys”) have used SDCC as a blowhorn to attract a growing fan base looking for more than just a trip to the movies.\n\nMany of the year’s big Hollywood superhero moments have already been postponed. Sony’s “Bloodshot” was the long-awaited emergence of Valiant Comics on the big screen. The movie debuted March 13 but was made available for on-demand purchase on March 24 after theaters across the country began closing. Marvel Studios’s “Black Widow,\" scheduled for a May release, was moved to Nov 6. WB/DC’s “Wonder Woman” sequel, “Wonder Woman 1984,” was pushed later in the summer, to August 14.\n\nThe Comic-Con news is especially hard for the comic book industry, which is already dealing with potential store closings nationwide, while major publishers like Marvel and DC, and their primary distributor, Diamond, have temporarily stopped production. Even amid the glare of the Hollywood lights, SDCC is still a premiere stop for the top comic-book writers and artists.\n\nThe Comic-Con Museum in San Diego says its scheduled opening is still on track

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 956121, "name": "Elise Viebeck"}, "body": "The Supreme Court ruled on Monday of last week that absentee ballots in Wisconsin’s primary had to be postmarked by April 7, the date of election, but could be counted as long as they were received by April 13. Typically, absentee ballots in Wisconsin must be received on or by Election Day in order to count, making the decision a victory for Democrats as they seek to ease voting restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarc Elias, a Democratic elections lawyer involved in both cases, said that precedent may be helpful in the legal push against Arizona’s deadline, which has emerged as the first test of whether lower courts will follow the Supreme Court’s lead. The original suit was filed in November.\n\n“What we’ve asked the court to do is to frankly agree with what the Supreme Court did in Wisconsin, which is to say that ballots that are postmarked by Election Day will count,” Elias said Wednesday. “That’s exactly the relief we seek in Arizona.”\n\nChallenging “Election Day receipt” laws is one priority for Democrats as they seek to roll back restrictions on voting by mail this year. Other goals include allowing third-party ballot collection, free postage and the opportunity for voters to fix a rejected ballot.\n\nElias, who is leading the effort, said the issue of ballot rejections because of missed deadlines tends to disproportionately affect Native American and Hispanic voters in Arizona.\n\n“It’s an overall problem, but it’s a particular problem because of the impact it has on certain categories of voters,” he said, citing research submitted to the court this week. “We’ve seen covid and what it is doing to rates of absentee voting and also rates of rejection of absentee ballots. ... We know this burden falls on voters generally but it falls on minority voters more heavily.”\n\nThe lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona was filed on behalf of the Voto Latino Foundation, a nonprofit civic engagement group; Democratic super PAC Priorities USA; and Shelby Aguallo, an Arizona resident who stated in a February court filing that her November 2018 ballot did not count because it did not arrive until two days after Election Day.\n\n“Given what happened in the fall of 2018, I am afraid that my vote will not count again in the upcoming election,” Aguallo wrote in a Feb. 25 declaration. “ … Even if I am able to send my ballot back at least a week before the election, I will not be able to incorporate any information or news that breaks in the last week of the election into my decision about the candidates I should vote for.”\n\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, the defendant in the suit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Hobbs have argued that the case should be dismissed because some of the plaintiffs lack standing and because Hobbs has “no enforcement authority” to ensure ballots postmarked by Election Day are counted.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-4", "parent":

Two days later, the pregnant 27-year-old had developed a fever â€” a dangerous condition for a woman 33 weeks pregnant. She went to the hospital where she worked as a respiratory therapist to be tested for the coronavirus.\n\nâ€œI was taking precautions, I didnâ€™t go to work because I am pregnant,â€� Primachenko told â€œToday.â€� â€œI donâ€™t know where I caught it, I donâ€™t know where it happened, but somehow I just ended up coming to the hospital and just getting sicker and sicker.â€� \n\nShe tested positive for the virus on March 26 and her health rapidly deteriorated. Two days later, she was struggling to breathe normally. On March 29, her doctors put her into the medically-induced coma so that her body could focus on overcoming the infection.\n\nOn April 1, while Primachenko was still unconscious and fighting the virus, doctors induced labor and delivered her daughter, Ava.\n\nDoctors placed the premature Ava in the neonatal intensive care unit until she can eat and poop on her own, Primachenkoâ€™s twin sister, Oksana Luiten, told KGW. The mother and daughter wonâ€™t be reunited until Primachenko has two negative coronavirus tests in a row.\n\nBut Primachenko said she has been able to see her daughter over video calls when her husband, David, visits Ava in the hospital.\n\nLuiten told KGW the familyâ€™s ordeal made them wish people would take the coronavirus pandemic seriously.\n\nâ€œThis is not a joke,â€� Luiten said. â€œThis is not an average flu, this is much, much worse.â€� \n\nPrimachenko began to recover earlier this month, when she was able to come off a ventilator and breathe on her own. Her colleagues gathered to cheer and applaud as she was wheeled out of the intensive care unit.\n\nâ€œEveryone did a standing ovation and just clapped me out of the ICU, which was so amazing and such a huge thing to be able to leave the ICU and go to the floors,â€� Primachenko said. â€œIt was just the grace of God.â€� \n\nFor Primachenko and her family, Avaâ€™s birth and her motherâ€™s recovery have been an inspiration during a dark time.\n\nâ€œI donâ€™t know how to make it through without faith,â€� Luiten told KGW. â€œFaith for healing, faith for life after death, faith for it all.â€� \n\nPrimachenko and her husband chose the newbornâ€™s name for its symbolic meaning, she said.\n\nâ€œIt means â€˜breath of life,â€™â€� the mother said, â€œso sheâ€™s our new little breath of life.â€� \n\nThe new baby joins her big sister, Emily, who is only about 10 months older than her newborn sibling since Ava was born prematurely.\n\nâ€œEven in the hardest days and the hardest times, thereâ€™s hope,â€� Primachenko said. â€œAnd you can rely on God and people and community.

They say Colombian officials have deserted them.\n\n“We don’t know what will happen to us, we need Colombian authorities to step up and help us return to our country,” said Ángelo Taborda, who speaks on the behalf of the supporters, in a phone interview with The Associated Press.\n\nThe March 10 match ended in a 3-0 Boca win. Only days later the South American tournament was suspended because of the outbreak.\n\nThe Colombian fans attempted to return home via Bolivia and Brazil, but when they were about to cross the border with Bolivia, Argentinian President Alberto Fernández closed it. On March 20, he also issued a decree for mandatory isolation.\n\nThe supporters were stranded for 15 days in the bordering town of La Quiaca, where Taborda said they were beaten and robbed.\n\nThe Colombian fans were then put on a bus and sent back to Buenos Aires. As they were about to arrive in the capital, police stopped them because their vehicle had no authorization to enter.\n\nSince the beginning of the month the fans are in one of the hotels that Buenos Aires city hall is offering for foreigners and Argentinians coming from abroad to quarantine.\n\nAll supporters were tested negative for COVID-19, local authorities said. The fans spend their days by the hotel’s windows, showing off their tattoos, waving shirts of their club and of Colombia’s national team. Many of their neighbors do not enjoy their noise.\n\nTheir quarantine ends in two days. Colombia’s consulate in Buenos Aires is expected to pay the bill.\n\n“They said they will have us here until tomorrow, and we don’t know what will happen to us then,” Taborda said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jairo Anchique contributed to this report in Colombia.\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 948200, "name": "Scott Allen"}, "body": "Walters owner Jeremy Gifford, who has several BreakingT designs in his regular rotation, was delighted when BreakingT president Jamie Mottram contacted him last week about a similar partnership to support his staff. Gifford even suggested the concept for what became the â€œDistance Now, Hugs Laterâ€� design, telling Mottram he couldnâ€™t believe that BreakingT hadnâ€™t thought of it first. The shirts, which are licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, went on sale Monday.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re not going to be able to pay for my employees to go to college or anything, but any little bit helps,â€� Gifford said in a phone interview.\n\nWhen the NBA announced that it was suspending its season after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus on March 11, Gifford told all of his employees working that night to take a 30-minute break and apply for unemployment. Gifford saw the writing on the wall and wanted to give his staff a jump-start on a process that roughly 20 million Americans have gone through over the last month.\n\nWith dine-in service at D.C. restaurants prohibited for the foreseeable future, Walters, which opened in the spring of 2019 on the corner of South Capitol and N streets, rebuilt its entire business. In addition to offering delivery and takeout from its regular menu, the restaurant is now selling prepackaged bundles of groceries. The new revenue stream has enabled Gifford to bring back about a half-dozen of his 50 employees, and pay them more than they would receive through unemployment benefits. He plans to split the proceeds from T-shirt sales among the remainder of his staff.\n\nâ€œLosing the XFL was a humongous loss,â€� Gifford said. â€œThen D.C. United and the Nationals, thatâ€™s the entire summer. Our fortunes are so tied to the baseball team.â€�\n\nThe coronavirus has forced BreakingT, which specializes in turning trending sports moments into apparel, to reimagine its business as well. The company now features a line of â€œSocial Distanceâ€� T-shirts on its website, including â€œ2020 Social Distancing Championâ€� and â€œFauci the Real MVPâ€� designs.\n\nâ€œWe had to get creative,â€� Mottram said. â€œWeâ€™ve done some nostalgic, classic stuff, including a classic baseball moments collection. Itâ€™s just strange, because weâ€™re used to reacting really quickly to something thatâ€™s surging, and in this case we have all the time in the world. Itâ€™s been a little out of our element.â€�\n\nMottram said the companyâ€™s wholesale-to-retail business has been virtually nonexistent for the last month, while online sales have exceeded projections.\n\nâ€œAs a Nats fan, I just canâ€™t wait for baseball to come back so we can celebrate their world championship,â€� Mottram said.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re looking at the calendar thinking nothingâ€™s going to get back to normal until the fall, but who knows?â€� Gifford said. â€œNot that being a grocery store isnâ€™t fun, but weâ€™re ready to reopen and become a restaurant again.â€�\n\nRead more on the Nationals:", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB18-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB18-5",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1025847, "name": "Rick Maese"}, "body": "Now, like so many athletes and non-athletes alike, the 28-year-old is largely confined to the indoors, unable to swim, unable to train as she would like and trying her best to maintain her fitness level amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSo she turned to booze — but in a completely healthy way.\n\nPre-pandemic, Anderson’s daily workout consisted of a two-hour swim in the morning, 30 to 60 minutes in the weight room and another pool session in the afternoon. She would log eight or so miles in the water in a typical day.\n\n“There’s nothing on land that you can do that’s comparable to swimming,” she explained in a recent phone interview.\n\nAt her Santa Monica, Calif., home, Anderson has little weight-training equipment, so she has had to improvise.\n\n“I had to get creative,” she said. “There’s no dumbbells around, so I’ve been using wine and beer bottles. Nothing too heavy, but that was the best I could think of.” \n\nFor one exercise — a shoulder-strengthening drill called I’s, Y’s and T’s — Anderson lies facedown on a bench, lifting the beer bottles in her outstretched arms, her body forming the shape of the different letters. In another, she lies on her back, lifting her legs and arms simultaneously. She holds a wine bottle in either hand for added weight.\n\nThis isn’t how she envisioned her Olympic training just a few weeks ago. Anderson was at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs last month when she received a message that said the training facilities were closing immediately. She returned to California the next morning and was able to swim for a couple of days.\n\n“But then that shut down, too,” she said. “It felt like I couldn’t do what I needed to do. It was hard mentally: You can’t be in the water, but you also have to train. I mean, the Olympics were four months away. So the postponement was actually a really big relief.” \n\nThat was around March 20, and Anderson hasn’t been in the water since. She took a month-long break from swimming following the 2016 Olympics but otherwise has never had this long of a break from the water.\n\nNone of this is ideal. She has had to accept that so much is out of her control, and mentally she has had to adjust her life calendar, delaying all of her plans and goals by 12 months.\n\n“I’ve been thinking about 2020 since 2016,” said Anderson, a silver medalist at the 2012 London Games. “It’s not like I started thinking about this on January 1, 2020. … So it’s hard. I was planning training camps and races and trips for this one day in 2020 — this one race. Now it’s like, ‘I hope I don’t lose steam and the momentum I had.’ I still have the same drive and goals.” \n\nAnderson is hoping when restrictions lift in California and pools and gyms reopen, her body will be ready to resume regular training and she’ll have more than a year to shake off any rust.\n\n“I don’t want to come out of this 15 pounds heavier,” she said with a laugh. “I want to stay as active as possible.” \n\nHer sport requires strength but also plenty of endurance and stamina. Anderson alternates between biking and running each day, but it’s not the same as long-distance swimming.\n\n“I'm definitely losing endurance and cardio. I can swim for a very long time, but my running is terrible,” she said. “I retired from running in eighth grade.” \n\nShe has a yoga mat and medicine ball at home and bought a suspension band that she uses daily. Plus, she has those wine and beer bottles.\n\n“I know I’m missing out on some good exercises,” she said, “but it’s been fun getting creative.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-38",

It also did not take place during World War I. One option is to cancel the race outright this year, but organizers hope to find a later date and they are not likely to favor staging the race without the thousands of fans who line the roadsides.\n\nThe Giro d’Italia earlier was called off along with the Milan-San Remo, Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix single-day races. Earlier this month, the International Cycling Union furloughed staff and cut its leaders’ salaries because of the outbreak, with officials citing postponement of the Olympics and Paralympics as well as losing most of its events.\n\nTeam Ineos’s Egan Bernal won last year’s Tour de France.\n\nAs for the auto race, F1 officials continue to look for ways to rework the schedule, hoping to start it in Europe in the summer and has not ruled out holding some without spectators. Ross Brawn, the managing director of Formula 1, said he believed that a world championship season could be held even if the first race were not held until October. In addition, the season could run into January.\n\nLike other sports, F1 is feeling the financial pinch as income streams from broadcast rights, sponsorships and race-hosting fees are cut off.

On top of that, President Trump said in the next three days he will unveil a plan to get the U.S. economy back to work again. There also are more encouraging signs that we have hit the apex, or about to, regarding the covid-19 file. Spain just recorded its lowest number of cases since March 20th. Germany reported a drop in new cases for a fifth day in a row.”\n\nGlobal stocks rose Tuesday following several developments that signal potential relief of the weeks-long national lockdown.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) on Monday was joined via phone by governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island as they formed a pact to coordinate on an eventual end to their states’ restrictions. Later, Cuomo announced that Massachusetts, led by Gov. Charlie Baker (R), was joining the group.\n\n“Everyone is very anxious to get out of the house, get to work and get the economy moving. Everyone agrees with that, but the art form here is going to be doing that smartly, doing that productively, and doing that in a coordinated way,” Cuomo said.\n\n“This has to be informed by experts and by data,” Cuomo added. “You take one step forward, you see how it works, and then you measure the next step.”\n\nWest Coast governors of California, Oregon and Washington also announced a pact to work together to control the outbreak and carefully restart the economy in their states.\n\nStocks also got a push Tuesday after health firm Johnson  Johnson beat estimates and announced a 6.3 percent hike in its dividend, while also lowering full-year guidance due to the coronavirus. The company’s shares were up more than 3 percent in off-hours trading.\n\nClosely-followed JPMorgan Chase shares rose more than 1.3 percent in pre-market trades after the bank said its revenue held up in the first quarter even though its profit took a big hit.\n\nSam Stovall of CFRA Research said the expectations are so low for earnings, that anything resembling good news can help stocks.\n\n“The first quarter earnings bar is set so low that investors who are buying stocks believe they won’t injure themselves falling out of the basement window,” Stovall said. “And people are encouraged that the country may be getting back to work sooner rather than later.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2470742, "name": "Tom Jackman, Dana Hedgpeth"}, "body": "Virginia would have enough medical resources to handle the coronavirus outbreak for the next couple of months if current trends continue, according to a group of scientists from the University of Virginia and RAND helping the state model the likely course of the disease.\n\nBut Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said later Monday that while projections showed Virginia should have enough overall hospital bed space and general medical resources, the availability of personal protective gear, ventilators and staffing is an ongoing problem around the state.\n\n“Right now, Virginia’s hospitals have sufficient capacity to handle the surge in patients that we expect,” Northam said. But the modeling “also demonstrates that if we lift the stay-at-home order or social distancing too soon, if we try to rush to get our lives back to normal, the number of cases will spike higher and earlier and we can’t afford that.”\n\nThe study group, along with state Secretary of Health Dan Carey, said Monday in a media briefing that “Current social distancing efforts are working.”\n\nVirginians have cut back on retail and recreation activities by 44 percent, according to anonymized mobility data from Google, the scientists said. Visits to grocery stores are down 18 percent and travel to workplaces is down 39 percent, according to the data. Northam has banned gatherings of 10 or more people, urged nonessential businesses to shut down and instructed residents to shelter at home unless they have pressing reason to go out.\n\n“I think the average Virginian really needs to listen to the guidance of the state officials and try to do what they’re asked because it’s working,” said Chris Barrett, executive director of the University of Virginia’s Biocomplexity Institute. Lifting the restrictions could lead quickly to a second wave of infections, the scientists said.\n\nCarey said Northam’s administration is studying the projections to plan for how and when to ease the state out of the policies, which run through June 10 — looking at the data to find “triggers for when you open a certain amount.”\n\nBeyond the timing, though, officials are looking ahead to new policies that might need to be in place once broader restrictions are rolled back.\n\n“We definitely need to have additional strategies” to plan for a gradual reopening of society, Carey said. That could mean a more complex regimen of testing to identify exactly who has been infected, body temperature testing for people as they head back to their places of work and mobile apps for tracing contacts among individuals to pinpoint everyone’s risk of transmission, he said.\n\nAbout 85 scientists and researchers at the Biocomplexity Institute have been developing computer models to chart the possible course of the disease in the state, taking work done elsewhere and adapting it for regional differences and data around Virginia.\n\nTheir projections suggest a range of possible trajectories but have led Northam to say he anticipates the peak period of infection to occur sometime between late April and late May.\n\nThe researchers found that if Northam’s restrictions expire on June 10 and then business in the state immediately returns to about half its usual capacity, a steep second wave of coronavirus cases would surge soon after. Left unaddressed, that wave would overwhelm most hospital systems in the state by August — with Northern Virginia being hit soonest and hardest.\n\nThis post has been updated with comments from Gov.

The Points of Light Foundation’s National Volunteer Week is April 19-25, 2020.\n Originally founded in 1974, National Volunteer Week was established to acknowledge and thank those who selflessly grant their time, skills, donations of goods, services, funding and platforms to help other people.\n In these trying times, there are still so many ways to do good things for others. Check out pointsoflight.org for more information.\n P.S. The nonpartisan Points of Light Foundation came about from President George H.W. Bush’s famous 1989 1,000 Points of Light speech.\n Dear Heloise: What is artificial intelligence, or AI?\n Marie K. in Florida\n Marie K. in Florida: “Artificial intelligence” is the part of computer science that works to develop intelligent machines that can “sense” their environment and “act” to achieve a goal.\n Many drones work by artificial intelligence. Do you have one of those smart speakers/virtual assistants that can play music, dim the lights, set the alarm, give you a weather forecast, as well as many other tasks, by your voice command? That is artificial intelligence!\n Dear Readers: Tomorrow is April 15, normally the date when taxes are due. But, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the IRS is suspending the due date to pay your taxes until July 15. If you’re not able to pay all that you owe or file your return on time, you can contact the Internal Revenue Service at IRS.gov. They want to help. As you can imagine, their call volume is high right now. Check out the website first, and if you still have a question, give them a call:\n Individuals: 800-829-1040\n Businesses: 800-829-4933\n TDY/TDD: 800-829-4059\n Do not avoid the IRS. They are eager to assist.\n Dear Readers: The Internet has revolutionized information management, but is there an easier way to search for what you’re looking for? Enter these bits of info into your search engine to save time and streamline your search:\n * Looking for where a particular quote comes from? Put it in quotation marks. Ex: “To be or not to be.”\n * What’s the definition of a word? Type “define:” in the search bar before your word.\n * To look for information on a range of things or information on a list, type two periods between the range. Ex: Comedy movies 1960..1970\n Happy navigating!\n Dear Heloise: I write a lot of online reviews of products, restaurants, hotels, services and on and on. It's really important for the company to get honest and fair reviews.\n First off, if I had a problem or bad experience, I contact the company directly to give them a chance to fix it. Normally, they appreciate the opportunity to solve the problem.\n I always point out the positive and then offer a suggestion of how they can improve something minor. Example: The hamburgers are fresh and delicious, but my fries were a bit overcooked.\n You better believe those companies read their own online reviews. Some even go in and respond with a comment! \n Dan R. in Connecticut\n  Heloise’s column appears six days a week at washingtonpost.com/advice. Send a hint to Heloise, P.O.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1089686, "name": "Michelle Boorstein"}, "body": "He was a friend and a pillar of the region’s faith community, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) tweeted Sunday.\n\n“My heart sinks as I learn this morning that Bishop Gerald Glenn, pastor of New Deliverance Evangelistic Church, died yesterday from COVID-19,” Kaine said. “May all do as much for so many.”\n\nGlenn preached in church about the virus in March, before he became sick, encouraging people not to be afraid. On March 22, five days after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) had urged people to “avoid non-essential gatherings of more than 10 people,” Glenn preached in church to his congregation that “I firmly believe that God is larger than this dreaded virus,” according to a video played April 6 by Richmond station WTVR, before he died.\n\nOn March 23 Northam ordered nonessential businesses closed and banned all gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nGlenn’s widow, Mother Marcietia Glenn, also has Covid-19, according to a YouTube post on Easter by church Elder Bryan Nevers, who also announced Glenn’s death Saturday night. All sermons were removed from the church’s YouTube channel Monday evening.\n\nThe New Deliverance community was left to wrestle with his death. They are part of the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination hit hard by covid-19.\n\n“We still believe in God for healing right now,” Nevers said on the Sunday video, his voice wavering, the rows of purple seats behind him empty in the church. “Our bishop always told us, even as they wheeled him into the operating room, he proclaimed that God is still a healer…I don’t know how, but I have to say: God will get the glory from this.”\n\nThe April 6 WTVR report quoted Glenn’s daughter, identified as Mar-Gerie Crawley, as saying her father had been sick for about a week before he was hospitalized. She said he had diverticulitis – a digestive condition – and it wasn’t uncommon for him to get fevers and viruses. His wife took him for a second time to the emergency room in late March, Crawley said, once his breathing was labored and he was very lethargic. He was tested for covid-19 and immediately got a positive result.\n\nShe said her father’s encouraging, well-populated March 22 service was held “not to disrespect [officials] but to support those who were scared.” She said her parents were both very affectionate. “Mom and Dad are hugging [type] people. That’s what they do, they hug everyone.”\n\nIn a now-removed video on the church’s site, Glenn led the March 15 service, telling people in a light-hearted way not to shake hands.\n\n“I’m glad to be in the lord’s house. It didn’t have to be this way, the government could have said we couldn’t gather at all.. Just imagine if the government had the authority to say you and me, we can’t go to church. Aren’t you glad you were free to get up and come?”\n\nIn the video he said 185 people had come to the morning service. He also noted that the virus had captivated the world, and terrified people.\n\n“You may never say this aloud, but you have to wonder: Why did God let this happen? I’ve heard other questions by theologians and I think it’s valid. Is this virus a sign of the end times?... It makes us look at our own immediate mortality.”\n\nEarlier in the sermon, he said: “If I had to deliver my own eulogy, I’d say: ‘God is greater than any challenge you and I face. That would be my epitaph.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB23", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB23", "parent": null}, "score":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1684847, "name": "Christopher Sherman"}, "body": "A lack of resources and training in the face of the pandemic has spurred a number of protests by workers in Mexico’s public health system in recent weeks. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has conceded that the system does not have the number of doctors and nurses that it needs as the epidemic begins to ramp up. One planeload of medical gear arrived from China this week and a second one was scheduled to arrive Friday night.\n\nMexico has more than 3,000 confirmed COVID-19 infections and nearly 200 deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nZoé Robledo, director of Mexico public health system, said Wednesday that talk of a COVID-19 outbreak at the Tlalnepantla hospital was “incorrect.” He said an investigation showed three starting points for the outbreak: a patient who has recovered, a doctor who didn’t have contact with COVID-19 patients and another doctor who was also working in another health system. He differentiated it from an outbreak at a public hospital in the northern city of Monclova, which an investigation confirmed spread within the hospital.\n\nThe doctors and students demanded a public apology from Robledo.\n\n“Denying the presence of outbreaks in hospitals will not lead to managing them,” the doctors and interns wrote.\n\nThe public health system’s hospital in the northern suburb of Tlalnepantla had been designated as a facility to handle coronavirus patients, but patients displaying those symptoms were supposed to be isolated from other parts of the hospital. The letter said that did not occur and 19 of the 26 resident doctors in internal medicine tested positive days after a patient displaying coronavirus symptoms was brought to their floor. More such cases followed and the medical staff there had not been given protective equipment.\n\nIn late March, so many of the hospital’s more experienced doctors were staying home and so many residents were showing symptoms and not working that the residents and interns were left practically alone with one or two residents for 85 patients, the letter said.\n\nWhen Mexico’s health undersecretary Hugo López-Gatell was asked about the hospital Thursday night, he spoke only generally about more protective equipment being distributed in the public health system, but did not address what happened at the hospital.\n\nThe doctors said the hospital’s epidemiology unit did not move to test them until March 30 and even then made the residents take samples from each other without protective equipment. Those whose symptoms were not bad enough yet continued working, and several of those later tested positive, the letter said.\n\nSimilar complaints have emerged at other public hospitals around Mexico, spurring protests at some demanding that staff receive the necessary protective gear and training to work through the epidemic.\n\nA hospital in the northern steel town of Monclova was the site of another outbreak and a protest by staff that complained they were being put at risk by the public health system. Three members of that staff have died from COVID-19 related illness and nearly 30 have been infected.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Opposition political leaders have suggested he downplayed the severity of the virus and have said it may have been tied to wanting to hold the Olympics this year.\n\n“We have made the decision to postpone the games by one year,” Muto added. “So this means that all we can do is work hard to prepare for the games. We sincerely hope that come next year mankind will manage to overcome the coronavirus crisis.”\n\nMuto was asked if there are alternative plans to 2021.\n\n“Rather than think about alternatives plans, we should put in all of our effort,” he said. “Mankind should bring together all of its technology and wisdom to work hard so they can development treatments, medicines and vaccines.”\n\nJapan has reported about 5,000 cases and 100 deaths. The country has the world’s oldest population, and COVID-19 can be especially serious for the elderly.\n\nMuto was asked several times about the added costs of postponing, which has been estimated by Japanese media at between $2 billion-$6 billion. He said it was too soon to know the price tag and who would pay.\n\nHe also acknowledged that Tokyo Olympic organizers had taken out insurance.\n\n“Tokyo 2020 has taken out several insurance policies,” he said. “But whether the postponement of the games qualifies as an event that is covered is not clear yet.”\n\nHe was also asked about the Olympic flame, which was taken off public display this week in Fukushima prefecture. Muto had an away-from-the-microphone talk with Tokyo spokesman Masa Takaya before talking about the flame.\n\n“After the Olympic torch relay was canceled, the Olympic flame was put under the management of Tokyo 2020,” Muto said. “Obviously in the future there is a possibility it might be put on display somewhere. However, for now it is under the management of Tokyo 2020 and I’m not going to make any further comment on the issue.”\n\nThere are suggestions the International Olympic Committee is thinking of taking the flame on a world tour, hoping to use it as a symbol of the battle against the virus. However, any tour would be impossible until travel restrictions are lifted.\n\nTaking the flame away from Japan could also upset the hosts.\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The couple moved to San Francisco in 1953.\n\nThey co-founded with other lesbian couples the Daughters of Bilitis, a political and social organization for lesbians. They published a national monthly for lesbians and in 1972, a book called Lesbian/Woman.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom referenced her death at his daily briefing on the coronavirus pandemic Thursday, calling her one of his heroes.\n\nNewsom was a newly elected mayor of San Francisco in 2004 when he decided to challenge California’s marriage laws by issuing licenses to same-sex couples. His advisers and gay rights advocates had the perfect couple in mind to be the public face of the movement.\n\nLyon and Martin, who had by then been together more than 50 years, were secretly swept into the clerk’s office. They exchanged vows before a tiny group of city staff members and friends, according to a 2008 Associated Press story. Afterward they went to lunch, just the two of them.\n\n“Of course, nobody down there knew, so we were left to be by ourselves like we wanted to be,” Martin said. “Then we came home.”\n\n“And watched TV,” added Lyon.\n\nA wedding portrait of the couple cradling each other in pastel-colored pantsuits with their foreheads touching drew worldwide attention.\n\nLater that year, the state Supreme Court voided the unions before overturning the state’s ban on gay marriage in 2008. They wed again, among the first couples to do so in the state. Del Martin died weeks after their second wedding at age 87.\n\n“I am devastated to lose Del, but I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed,” Lyon said at the time.\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.\n\nCalifornia’s biggest political leaders expressed their sorrow Thursday and thanked Lyon —and her late wife — for their tireless efforts to make the city a better place.\n\n“All those who were blessed to know Phyllis and Del remember the extraordinary love that they had for each other,” said U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is from San Francisco, in a statement. “As we mourn the loss of our dear Phyllis, we find peace in knowing that she and Del are together again.”\n\nLyon was born Nov. 10, 1924, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She grew up in Sacramento, California, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, where she was editor of the heralded Daily Californian newspaper.\n\nLyon was a police reporter in Fresno and a reporter at the Chico Enterprise-Record during the 1940s, according to Kendell.\n\nFamily and friends are planning a celebration of her life.\n\nThis story has been corrected to accurately spell Kate Kendell.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The goal is to get as much of the country as possible open by April 30, the current deadline Trump set for stringent social distancing measures.\n\nThe economic task force will not meet every day, like the large one, and is expected to have a more informal feel, with many of the meetings held over the phone and as in-person briefings with the president.\n\nAn announcement could come as early as this week, although within the West Wing, there were previous plans to announce this second task force earlier this week — and those were delayed.\n\nThe White House declined to specifically comment on the new task force.\n\n“President Trump’s policies took this economy to record setting historic highs for all Americans but this unforeseen, unprecedented crisis has hurt many workers and businesses,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “The President wants to see this economy open again so people can get back to work, but scientific data will drive the timeline on those decisions because his number one priority is to protect the safety and well-being of the American people.”\n\nThe second task force adds yet another layer to an already unwieldy bureaucratic coronavirus response process within the White House; after becoming involved in the effort last month, Jared Kushner — Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser — has also formed his own working group, which some dismissively refer to as a shadow task force.\n\nThe idea of a group dealing solely with the economic impact of the virus has recently been under consideration.\n\nAfter initially announcing an Easter deadline — which falls on April 12 this year — to reopen the country, the president reluctantly pushed the time frame back to April 30, amid strong urging by public health officials. But he has remained fixated on reopening the economy and has publicly mused about a second task force focused on this goal.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump shared a tweet by Fox News host Dana Perino, in which she suggested a supplemental economic task force. “I think we need a 2nd task force assembled at direction of POTUS to look ahead to reopening of the economy,” Perino wrote. “Made up of a nonpartisan/bipartisan mix of experts across industry sectors, so that we have their recommendations  plan — let 1st task force focus on crisis at the moment.”\n\nAsked later at that day’s briefing whether he was, in fact, planning to go forward with a second task force, Trump replied that he was considering it.\n\n“Thinking about it,” he said. “Getting a group of people. And we have to open our country. You know, I had an expression: ‘The cure can’t be worse than the problem itself.’ Right? I started by saying that, and I continue to say it: The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.”\n\nTrump concluded: “We’ve got to get our country open.”", "categories": [{"confident": false,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1438040, "name": "David Von Drehle"}, "body": "If this pandemic is a war, Lisa Ewald was a soldier on the front line — sent into battle short on supplies and knowledge of the enemy, as first waves so often are. Wars tend to begin with overconfidence; then comes chaos; then carnage. As the novel coronavirus overran Detroit’s defenses, Ewald was among the first to meet it. The registered nurse died alone at home of covid-19 on March 31, a few days shy of her 54th birthday.\n The Henry Ford Health System operates multiple facilities across Greater Detroit, but the flagship hospital in Midtown is one of the nation’s great urban medical centers. Located across the street from the original Motown Records studio, the redbrick complex has opened its doors for more than a century to all the good and the bad of a turbulent city. It’s no place for the faint of heart.\n  Ewald, an RN for more than 20 years, brightened the emergency room each day when she arrived at 7 a.m., cracking jokes and talking politics, according to a colleague’s Facebook post. She was \"an amazing nurse and dedicated her life to serving others,” the colleague wrote. Her niece Aubree Standifer Farmer told the Detroit News that Ewald believed she contracted the virus while treating a patient complaining of chest pains in mid-March.\n Apparently, hospital protocol at the time did not call for her to wear a mask in what appeared to be a non-respiratory case. But when the patient later proved to be infected with the virus, Ewald — who had asthma — asked to be tested. Citing guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the hospital did not test her until she showed symptoms.\n It’s unclear whether, or when, Ewald was added to Ford’s large-scale drug trial for hydroxychloroquine, the potentially promising covid-19 treatment touted by President Trump. She was never hospitalized, though neighbors in the nearby suburb of Dearborn reported that she was exhausted, fatigued and sleeping at odd hours. She was found dead when a colleague came to check on her.\n  Days pass like weeks in a crisis. Much has changed since the patient with chest pains unwittingly loosed an unseen virus to war on Lisa Ewald. The Henry Ford Health System now houses more than 700 covid-19 patients. Nearly a third of them are in critical condition. And though all staff and visitors now wear masks, nearly 750 hospital employees have tested positive for the virus. (At Beaumont Health, the largest hospital system in Detroit, the number is twice as high: Some 1,500 employees have tested positive for covid-19.)\n  [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] \n With better knowledge of the enemy, perhaps better gear on the way, maybe a more sophisticated battle plan, the war on covid-19 in Detroit may be settling into a grim campaign of hardened veterans. But when that next phase comes, and the tide begins to turn, we must not forget the soldiers we sent unprepared and undefended to meet the initial invasion. Soldiers such as Ewald, whose candle was snuffed by the enemy before she really had a chance to fight.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1320494, "name": "Heather Long"}, "body": "The 17 million figure includes new reporting from the Labor Department that even more people filed for unemployment in the prior week, pushing the jobless claims up during the week ending March 28 to a record 6.9 million, up from 6.6 million.\n\nTop government and health officials have ordered a sweeping closure of businesses in an effort to fight the coronavirus by keeping workers and customers at home, but the side effect has been a massive rise in unemployment. Janet L. Yellen, one of the world’s top economists, said U.S. unemployment rate has jumped to at least 12 or 13 percent already, the worst level of joblessness the nation has seen since the Great Depression.\n\nNearly every industry is slashing workers and pay as tens of thousands of businesses closed due to shelter in place orders in more than 40 states. The hospitality sector -- hotels, restaurants, and amusement parks -- has seen the steepest losses, but manufacturing, retail, construction and even the health care sector outside of hospitals are shedding workers.\n\n“Today’s report continues to reflect the purposeful sacrifice being made by America’s workers and their families to slow the spread of the coronavirus,” said Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia in a statement.\n\nThere was hope that swift government aid for businesses would entice companies to keep workers employed and paychecks flowing, but job losses have mounted even after Congress passed a historic $2 trillion relief package. Businesses small and large are struggling to get loans. As companies run out of cash, they are cutting workers and telling them to file for unemployment benefits. But many states have been slow to distribute money.\n\nIt takes two to three weeks to process someone’s unemployment claim in normal times. Since Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, state unemployed systems have been overrun, causing even longer delays.\n\nFlorida started handing out paper unemployment applications this week because the state’s jobless claims website kept failing. In New York, laid off workers are having to call hundreds of times to complete their applications. The Washington Post spoke with a dozen workers across the country. Only one, a waitress in Pennsylvania who filed on March 19, had received money so far.\n\nAs unemployment checks are slow to arrive, people are turning to whatever aid they can find. Modern day “bread lines” have started appearing in cities like Orlando, San Diego, Pittsburgh and Cleveland where thousands lined up for free food. The slow release of funds in the United States is a marked contrast from Denmark where the government is paying workers 75 percent of their salaries during the pandemic, and Canada, which vowed to get money to workers in 10 days or less.\n\n“There were already hurdles to accessing unemployment benefits before the pandemic hit. Many states had done everything they could to reduce access to benefits. Well, now we are seeing the result,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links":

Janet L. Yellen, one of the world’s top economists, said U.S. unemployment rate has jumped to at least 12 or 13 percent already, the worst level of joblessness the nation has seen since the Great Depression.\n\nNearly every industry is slashing workers and pay as tens of thousands of businesses closed due to shelter in place orders in more than 40 states. The hospitality sector -- hotels, restaurants, and amusement parks -- has seen the steepest losses, but manufacturing, retail, construction and even the health care sector outside of hospitals are shedding workers.\n\nThere was hope that swift government aid for businesses would entice companies to keep workers employed and paychecks flowing, but job losses have mounted even after Congress passed a historic $2 trillion relief package. Businesses small and large are struggling to get loans. As companies run out of cash, they are cutting workers and telling them to file for unemployment benefits. But many states have been slow to distribute money.\n\nIt takes two to three weeks to process someone’s unemployment claim in normal times. Since Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, state unemployed systems have been overrun, causing even longer delays.\n\nFlorida started handing out paper unemployment applications this week because the state’s jobless claims website kept failing. In New York, laid off workers are having to call hundreds of times to complete their applications. The Washington Post spoke with a dozen workers across the country. Only one, a waitress in Pennsylvania who filed on March 19, had received money so far.\n\nAs unemployment checks are slow to arrive, people are turning to whatever aid they can find. Modern day “bread lines” have started appearing in cities like Orlando, San Diego, Pittsburgh and Cleveland where thousands lined up for free food. The slow release of funds in the United States is a marked contrast from Denmark where the government is paying workers 75 percent of their salaries during the pandemic, and Canada, which vowed to get money to workers in 10 days or less.\n\n“There were already hurdles to accessing unemployment benefits before the pandemic hit. Many states had done everything they could to reduce access to benefits. Well, now we are seeing the result,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links":

The goal is to get as much of the country as possible open by April 30, the current deadline Trump set for stringent social distancing measures.\n\nThe economic task force will not meet every day, like the large one, and is expected to have a more informal feel, with many of the meetings held over the phone and as in-person briefings with the president.\n\nAn announcement could come as early as this week, although within the West Wing, there were previous plans to announce this second task force earlier this week — and those were delayed.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nThe second task force adds yet another layer to an already unwieldy bureaucratic coronavirus response process within the White House; after becoming involved in the effort last month, Jared Kushner — Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser — has also formed his own working group, which some dismissively refer to as a shadow task force.\n\nThe idea of a group dealing solely with the economic impact of the virus has recently been under consideration.\n\nAfter initially announcing an Easter deadline — which falls on April 12 this year — to reopen the country, the president reluctantly pushed the time frame back to April 30, amid strong urging by public health officials. But he has remained fixated on reopening the economy and has publicly mused about a second task force focused on this goal.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump shared a tweet by Fox News host Dana Perino, in which she suggested a supplemental economic task force. “I think we need a 2nd task force assembled at direction of POTUS to look ahead to reopening of the economy,” Perino wrote. “Made up of a nonpartisan/bipartisan mix of experts across industry sectors, so that we have their recommendations  plan - let 1st taskforce focus on crisis at the moment.”\n\nLater, asked at Saturday’s briefing whether he was, in fact, planning to go forward with a second task force, Trump replied that he was considering it.\n\n“Thinking about it,” he said. “Getting a group of people. And we have to open our country. You know, I had an expression: ‘The cure can’t be worse than the problem itself.’ Right? I started by saying that, and I continue to say it: The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.”\n\nTrump concluded: “We’ve got to get our country open.”", "categories": [{"confident": false,

Discussing it along with his partner in the venture, Florida-based general surgeon Scott T. Kelley, Winston was eventually asked by host Ed Henry to comment on Brady and where he himself might play next.\n\nâ€œWell, one thing you can learn about me is my faith. I have tremendous faith in my Lord,â€� Winston replied. â€œAnd one thing about Tom Brady is that itâ€™s understood that he is the GOAT.\n\nâ€œAnd for you to get replaced by Tom Brady in a city that you love so much, I guess thatâ€™s kudos to me.â€� \n\nSay this much for Winston: If he shows this much composure and creativity in the pocket going forward, he might just get another starting job in the NFL.\n\nAs it is, he is a free agent who will likely have to wait at this point until after this monthâ€™s draft â€” assuming that manages to go as planned â€” before latching on with a team. Even then, Winston could have to settle for a backup role, despite coming off a season in which his 5,109 passing yards led the NFL.\n\nUnfortunately for the No. 1 overall pick in 2015, his 30 interceptions also led the league. After five years in which his inconsistent play contributed to a 28-42-0 record in games Winston started, the team appeared hesitant to bring him back even before Brady hit the market.\n\nWhile he remains in professional limbo, Winston has kept busy getting LASIK surgery and posting photos of himself working out. In addition to discussing the coronavirus hotline Wednesday, he shared details of his recent wedding to Breion Allen, his longtime girlfriend and the mother of their young son.\n\nWinston said of the wedding, which reportedly took place last month at their home in Odessa, Fla., on March 27, that it featured a â€œvery limitedâ€� guest list as a safety measure amid the pandemic. He noted that he and Allen exchanged their vows while standing in a swimming pool, and he claimed with a smile, â€œFrom my knowledge, chlorine does help prevent the spread of coronavirus.â€� \n\nDuring the interview, Winston quickly pivoted back to his hotline, which he touted as providing assistance to people â€œfrom the easy access of their own homes.â€� \n\nEarlier in the segment, the 26-year-old Winston pointed to how hard the pandemic has hit the African American community, as well as the community in and around his hometown of Bessemer, Ala. â€œI just really believe itâ€™s because of the resources that they lack, whether itâ€™s the local hospitals or different machines,â€� he said in explaining his motivation to try to help.\n\nAfter the conversation turned to his current situation in the NFL, Winston said, â€œAt the end of the day, itâ€™s a competitive sport. Weâ€™re all in the business.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m excited for whatever opportunity may hold, and eventually Iâ€™m going to have to play the Tom Bradys, the Patrick Mahomeses and all the other great quarterbacks,â€� he continued. â€œThatâ€™s how you win Super Bowls, and thatâ€™s what I want.â€�", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-12", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, which hosts the two-week event, is being converted to a 350-bed temporary hospital as New York battles its coronavirus crisis.\n\nAs it stands, the Citi Open would start Aug. 3, three weeks after the earliest date that men’s and women’s tournaments could resume (July 13), barring an extension of the current suspension of play.\n\nEin, a Washington-based venture capitalist who also owns the Washington Kastles TeamTennis franchise and the Washington Justice esports’ Overwatch team, acknowledged that having to cancel the Citi Open in his second year of managing the event would be costly.\n\n“If the tournament is canceled, we would lose a lot of money,” Ein said, “but the health and safety of everyone in our community is the higher priority. We would hope that doesn’t happen. But if it does, it’s because it’s the right thing to do.”\n\nRescheduling the Citi Open for later in 2020 would be difficult, Ein conceded, given the sport’s crowded calendar.\n\nFrench Open officials angered fellow tournament officials and many players by seizing the Sept. 20-Oct. 4 window to stage their postponed Grand Slam with minimal consultation. Those dates conflict with the Laver Cup, a star-studded, team-format event co-founded by Roger Federer and Tennis Australia. It also represents an unprecedented burden for top players, starting just one week after the U.S. Open ends, because they’re now expected to contest four weeks of Grand Slam events on two radically different surfaces in a five-week span.\n\nThe men’s field for the 2019 Citi Open, which was won by Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, included eight current or former top-10 players: Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, David Goffin, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, John Isner, Milos Raonic and Marin Cilic\n\nWhile 2020 Citi Open’s men’s field hasn’t been unveiled, the women’s event has received a commitment from Coco Gauff, the breakout star of the 2019 season.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the 2020 tennis calendar, Citi Open officials have put ticket-marketing operations on hold.", "categories": [{"confident":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2446240, "name": "Rokhaya Diallo"}, "body": "Although they were speaking about putting human lives at risk, the two doctors sounded totally casual.\n\nThe scientists ultimately apologized, but what is at stake is more than that single TV debate. The controversy unveiled an attitude that has been prevalent throughout French history.\n\nThe subtext of the conversation was clear. It conveyed a view that the bodies of Africans and sex workers are not valued in their own right. No mention of consent appeared during the talk. These bodies were presented as disposable subjects for any experimentation that could be helpful to the Western world.\n\nThis attitude has a lot to do with the history of France, and more generally of the construction of patriarchy and white supremacy. For centuries, enslaved and colonized bodies have been exploited for the purpose of so-called science.\n\nNumerous women were tortured by scientists so that colonial states could enjoy the progresses of medicine. These abusers include the American doctor James Marion Sims, known as the founder of the modern gynecology. His research was based on experiments performed on the bodies of enslaved black women, who endured atrocities in order to help him create tools that are still part of medicine today.\n\nSimilar abuses took place throughout French history and lasted even beyond the colonial era. In France, Saartjie Baartman — a woman from South Africa who became famous for her features, which were then seen as “exotic” and even erotic — was relentlessly exposed in fairs in the early 19th century, becoming a symbol of racist dehumanization. After her death in 1815, her body was dissected. Her remains stayed on display at the Museum of Mankind in Paris until the mid-1970s.\n\nThese attitudes are not just part of colonial history. As recently as 1996, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer conducted a meningitis drug trial on children in Nigeria; 11 children who took part in the trial died, and the company faced a lawsuit and eventually settled.\n\nNowadays, the bodies of sex workers and Africans are still seen as other, whether they are migrants unwanted by the Western world or prostitutes criminalized instead of being supported. The exploitation of these bodies is used to reinforce the structures of power created by colonization, enslavement and patriarchy.\n\nIn the midst of the spread of the covid-19 pandemic, many African nations cannot afford not to access treatments that could save their populations from tragedy. But they have their own scientists, and it is up to their governments to decide whether the tests are timely and appropriate. It is time to remove the colonial lens so that Africans settle policies on their own terms and remain in charge of their destinies.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB25-3", "level": 2,

And the question posed by then-Fox Business host Trish Regan did indeed mention the restrictions. But the number of confirmed cases in the United States now exceeds any other country’s (though data from China is unreliable).\n\nAt other times, McEnany joined in an aggressive attempt to portray the coronavirus as part of a political attempt to take Trump down — a claim that was popular at the time but has become less popular among Trump allies as the severity of the outbreak has become clear.\n\n“What is bad for America is good for Democrats,” she said Feb. 28 on Fox News. “It’s incredible that they think this way. They root against the stock market. They root for this [coronavirus] to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking down President Trump. It doesn’t matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there.”\n\nShe said on March 11, when Biden canceled campaign events: “Joe Biden’s looking for an excuse to get off the campaign trail. And let me just add: The media’s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies.”\n\nMcEnany continued: “We’re not going to cave to the media and Joe Biden. We’re not going to follow his lead as he tries to hide from the American people.”\n\nLater that day, though, the Trump campaign did follow Biden’s lead and canceled a series of rallies. Further events were canceled in the following days.\n\nOn Feb. 26, McEnany echoed Trump’s talking point that the coronavirus situation was “under control.” \n\nShe was asked whether the virus was a threat to Trump’s reelection, and she responded: “Not in the slightest. The president has this under control, and America will see that, just like with every single international incident. He knows what he’s doing.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-4", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1934294, "name": "Meryl Kornfield"}, "body": "With the executives’ blessing, Rathgeb, racecar driver Buddy Baker and a mechanical crew went to NASCAR’s Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama on March 24, 1970, with a Dodge Daytona stock car rigged with a nose cone on the wing of the car.\n\nThe first time around the oval track, the car clocked 194 mph. Thirty laps later, the team led by Rathgeb took it to 200.447 mph, a world record for a closed course.\n\n“NASCAR racing wouldn’t be what it is without Dad,” his son, Jeff Rathgeb, told The Washington Post.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the automotive achievement this year, car enthusiasts recalled Rathgeb, 90, who died two days before. He had contracted the coronavirus at a senior independent living community in West Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and was hospitalized from March 17 until he died on March 22, his family confirmed.\n\n“He has a legacy,” Jeff Rathgeb said of his father. “It’s been kind of humbling just to see the stuff on the Internet. It certainly helps.”\n\nEven though the family is waiting until after quarantine restrictions are lifted to hold a memorial, Rathgeb’s children, Sue, Jerry and Pam, are still appreciative of the automobile and racing community remembering their dad, Jeff Rathgeb said. Larry’s wife Phyllis also contracted coronavirus but is now recovering at home.\n\nRathgeb was among the more than 700 coronavirus fatalities Michigan had reported as of Monday night. More than 17,000 people have tested positive for virus in the state, which had the fourth-most cases in the country as of Monday.\n\nFifty years ago, it was a significant risk to change the design so drastically, and it could have cost Rathgeb his job.\n\n“I was grateful and privileged to work for Chrysler,” Rathgeb said, according to Mopar, a sister company of Chrysler.\n\nBut setting the 200-mile record proved he was right to suggest Chrysler focus on aerodynamics instead of horsepower, Doug Schellinger, the president of the Daytona-Superbird Auto Club in Milwaukee, told The Post.\n\n“They built a car that was strange-looking,” Schellinger said. “It would not appeal to everyone. The biggest positive to the cars, was the appearance. And the biggest negative of the cars was their appearance.”\n\nRathgeb was also a friend to well-known racecar drivers, including Baker and Richard Petty. Before Dale Earnhardt was a household name, Rathgeb encouraged him to pursue racing, Schellinger said.\n\nSteve Lehto, a Michigan lawyer who runs a YouTube channel about cars, said he is fascinated by the era of racing when Rathgeb reigned. He has interviewed Rathgeb, collected photos and written books about this time in stock-car racing.\n\nMany other influential figures from that era have since died, and Lehto said that Rathgeb’s death was a blow to his efforts to preserve the history and knowledge of auto racing.\n\nRathgeb told Lehto about his life outside of Chrysler, such as when he was in the motor pool for Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War. He previously was a general mechanic.\n\n“I was talking to him and he was casually mentioning these things, and I was like, ‘That’s a whole story right there. No, no, wait. That’s a whole story right there,’” Lehto told his YouTube followers in a video about Rathgeb. “The guy had an amazing life.”\n\nLehto said he treasures the times he got to talk to Rathgeb, including once when Rathgeb invited him to his home and showed him the chalkboard that clocked the record-setting time that day 50 years ago.\n\n“I interviewed him a couple of times, and I got a lot of great information from him,” Lehto told The Post. “But I assure you, I just scratched the surface of what he knew.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB2", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

The median listing price increased by just 2.5 percent during the week ending March 28 compared to the same week in 2019.\n\nHomes sold in a median of 60 days nationwide in March, four days faster than in March 2019.\n\n“Of course, the housing market, like the U.S. economy generally, is still undergoing a reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic, and conditions reflected in this data do not mean this momentum will carry forward into the spring,” Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an email. “At a national level, we see some deceleration in the weekly data in the last half of March — slowing price growth, fewer new listings — that could be a sign of what’s ahead.\"\n\nProperties in the Washington region sold in a median of 29 days, the third fastest in the country behind San Jose and Denver.\n\n\"The Washington metro area was a fast-moving real estate market in March, with … 24.4 percent fewer listings for buyers to choose from, and asking prices up 9 percent,” said Hale. “Conditions were tougher for buyers and better for sellers in this region than in the U.S. as a whole in March.”\n\nIn the D.C. region in March, 13.6 percent of homes sold at a reduced price. The percentage ranged from a low of 8.1 percent in San Jose and Seattle to a high of 26.2 percent in Tampa.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB21-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Celebrate only with the immediate family that’s at home with you now,” he said.\n\nBeginning Tuesday afternoon, Israel will ban movement between cities. From Wednesday evening until Thursday morning, Israelis will not be allowed to leave their homes.\n\nNetanyahu said similar travel restrictions would be in place for the upcoming holidays of Easter and Ramadan later in April.\n\nAt the same time, he said “there are positive signs on the horizon” and that preparations were already underway for a possible easing of movement restrictions after Passover.\n\nIsrael has reported nearly 9,000 cases of coronavirus and 57 deaths.\n\nFor most people, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and even lead to death.\n\nIn Egypt, the Coptic church said it was suspending Easter prayers and celebrations at churches later this month.\n\nChurch spokesman Boulis Halim told The Associated Press that the church also suspended services for the Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday, celebrated on April 19 by Egyptian Coptic Orthodox followers, one the world’s oldest Christian communities.\n\nMosques and churches have already been ordered to shut across Egypt to slow the spread of the deadly virus. Egypt has reported 1,173 cases and 78 fatalities so far.\n\nIran is facing the worst outbreak in the region. Iranian state TV reported Monday that the death toll there from the coronavirus rose by another 136 people, pushing total deaths to 3,739 amid 60,500 confirmed cases.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Officials in Hong Kong have discovered covid-19 in at least one cat and two dogs quarantined with their infected owners, while a cat in Belgium showed some signs consistent with the virus after its owner returned from Italy and later tested positive.\n\nWhile there have been no reports of pets in the United States contracting the virus, the USDA said it still recommends that “people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.”\n\n“If a sick person must care for a pet or be around animals, they should wash their hands before and after the interaction,” the agency said.\n\nFollowing Nadia’s positive coronavirus test, the Wildlife Conservation Society said Sunday that employees at the Bronx Zoo put in place “appropriate preventative measures,” leading some zoos elsewhere in the United States to follow suit. The Oakland Zoo, for example, said it was expanding its existing guidelines for personal protective equipment.\n\nThe animals at the Bronx Zoo who developed the dry cough were housed in its Tiger Mountain exhibit, the conservation society said. They included Nadia’s sister, Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions.\n\nBut while all showed similar respiratory symptoms, the USDA said Nadia was the only big cat tested because undergoing diagnostic tests requires that the big cats be placed under general anesthesia. The attending veterinarian “felt it was in the best interest of the animals to limit the potential risks of general anesthesia to one tiger for diagnostics,” the USDA said.\n\nThe Bronx Zoo also pointed out that coronavirus tests for people and animals are different, with the latter being performed at a veterinary lab, so no human in need of a test lost one to the tiger.\n\n“You cannot send human samples to the veterinary laboratory, and you cannot send animal tests to the human laboratories, so there is no competition for testing between these very different situations,” Dr. Paul Calle, the Bronx Zoo’s chief veterinarian, said in a statement.\n\nStill, the USDA said that the tiger’s diagnosis shouldn’t lead zoos or other pet owners to worry about routinely testing animals for coronavirus. And humans shouldn’t worry about catching it from pets or animals.\n\nThere is so far “no evidence,” the agency said, to suggest that animals who contract the virus can give it back to their keepers.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB16", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB16", "parent": null}, "score": 0.62, "taxonomy":
