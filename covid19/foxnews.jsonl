Driving ahead, customers would get their orders in another tub pushed to their window.\n“It’s going great,” Metzmacher said. “My regulars are supporting me, they’re really happy I’m open.”\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\nWithout people sticking around for a few more of the signature ciders, profit margins have been low -- but Metzmacher said it’s better than nothing.\n“At least we’re carrying on and we’re continuing to work,” he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB8-11", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

I know I think we should be thinking about that right now.”\nHe added:  “What we do between now and then is going to dictate a lot of that as well.”\nTRUMP WARNS OF ROUGH WEEK AHEAD: 'THERE WILL BE DEATH'\nThe Democrats already announced last week that they are pushing back their convention from a July 13 start date to August 17 because of fears that the country will still be on lockdown from the coronavirus.\n“In our current climate of uncertainty, we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention,” Joe Solmonese, CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee, said in a statement. “During this critical time, when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health care professionals and emergency responders.”\nBiden’s comments Sunday on ABC were not totally unexpected, as the former vice president has expressed his hesitancy about holding the convention in numerous interviews. \nBiden said in an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday night that “it’s hard to envision” thousands of Democratic convention delegates, officials, media and other spectators packed inside an arena this summer.\nBut Biden added that “we ought to be able to do what we were able to do in the middle of the Civil War, all the way through to World War II: have Democratic and Republican conventions, and primaries, and elections, and still have public safety. And we're able to do both. But the fact is that it may have to be different.\"\nBiden and his fellow candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have been forced by the pandemic to do virtual rallies and campaign events from their homes in Delaware and Vermont, respectively. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe coronavirus outbreak, which has spread globally, has forced most Americans to huddle in their homes in hopes of preventing the spread of the virus, which causes the deadly COVID-19 disease. Those venturing outside are urged to practice social distancing – keeping a minimum of 6 feet apart – and all large gatherings have been scrapped.\nThe Democratic convention will now be held the week before the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to take place Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C.\nMoving the Democratic convention to August -- which was under consideration for weeks by top Democratic Party officials -- became easier to do after the International Olympic Committee last week postponed the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo.

Kay Ivey and state Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris announced that the order would be in place until April 30, with a determination before then on whether the order would be extended past that date, AL.com reported.\n“We all have a duty to take this seriously,” the governor wrote in a Twitter message. “Wash your hands frequently, disinfect commonly used items often  practice social distancing.”\nFLORIDA'S DESANTIS ISSUES STATEWIDE STAY-AT-HOME ORDER TO CURB CORONAVIRUS\nIvey warned that that the state would likely see sharp rises in confirmed cases and deaths in the weeks ahead.\n“Folks, April stands to be very tough, and potentially very deadly,” the governor said, according to AL.com. “You need to understand we are past urging people to stay at home. It is now the law.”\nAs of late Saturday, Alabama had more than 1,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus – also known as COVID-19 – and had seen at least 26 deaths, according to the state’s Department of Public Health, division of infectious diseases and outbreaks.\nIvey, a Republican, had faced some criticism in the state for not enacting a stay-at-home order sooner. On Friday she addressed those concerns.\n\"I tried to find the right balance, something that was measured without overreacting that looked after people’s health without choking out the life from commerce,\" she said at a news conference Friday, according to the Advertiser.\n\n      Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey speaks to the media in Montgomery, Ala., Nov. 17, 2017. (Associated Press)\n      \n\n\nU.S. Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, argued that slowing the spread of the virus through a stay-at-home order would ultimately prove to be the best way to revive the economy.\n“We help this economy by staying home,” Jones said Thursday, according to the Advertiser. “By staying home, we can stop the spread, and we can get this economy rolling soon.”\nOn Friday, Ivey said the continued growth in cases in the state prompted her to finally issue the order.\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\"Yesterday [Thursday] the number of new cases jumped 160,\" she said at the news conference. “That was a big jump. Also EMA metrics that they got from the cell phone data, and it shows people are not paying attention to the orders we’ve asked them to abide by.” EMA refers to Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency.\nChambers County in eastern Alabama was especially hard hit, with authorities suspecting that local church gatherings may have helped spread the virus, the Advertiser reported.", "categories":

Instead the contests will be voted on 100 percent by mail. Officials have also pushed back the contests to allow voters more time to get their ballots in and for them to be counted.\nLouisiana was also due to hold its primary on Saturday, but the state has postponed the election until June 20.\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\nHawaii has already sent out two rounds of mailed ballots, and this week sent out a third. The deadline to register was also pushed back. Democrats there won’t have iprimary results until May.\nMeanwhile, in Alaska, the Democratic Party is allowing ballots to be downloaded from its website and has pushed back the date a mailed-in ballot needed to be postmarked from March 24 to April 10.\nIn Wyoming, the primary will also be mail-in only and people who registered too late to receive a ballot will be mailed one. The party also moved back the date by which ballots must be received from April 4 to April 17.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden currently holds a commanding lead in the primary, but Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has refused to throw in the towel, arguing that there is still a narrow path to victory for him.\nThe delays are one in a number of moves nationwide by Democratic Party officials, who have moved quickly to adapt their primary season to the unique challenge of the pandemic.\nDEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: STATES EMBRACE MAIL-IN VOTING AS CORONAVIRUS UPENDS ELECTIONS \n\n\nThe Democratic National Committee announced this week that its convention, scheduled for mid-July will be moved to August.\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers called for a special session of the state legislature Saturday to overhaul Tuesday's primary and allow an all-mail election. He is also calling for absentee ballots to be sent to every registered voter and the deadline for ballots to be sent back extended to May 26.\nWISCONSIN GOVERNOR, IN SURPRISE MOVE, CALLS SPECIAL SESSIONS TO HALT IN-PERSON VOTING IN LOOMING PRIMARY\nThe Democratic governor warned that in-person voting at polling stations would be “a very unnecessary public health risk” during the coronavirus crisis.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n“I can’t move this election or change the rules on my own. My hands are tied,” Evers pleaded in a video released on social media. “I was hopeful that the courts would intervene and help, and they did in fact implement some but not all of the common-sense changes I’ve been advocating for.”\nOn March 17, Florida, Illinois and Arizona were the last states to hold presidential primaries. Since then, 15 states and Puerto Rico – which were scheduled to hold their primaries and caucuses in late March, April or May –  postponed their contests or switched them to nearly entirely by mail or absentee ballot.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Instead, Disney said it will now open Nov. 6. Such delays have unique ramifications for Marvel movies because of their interconnection. With “Black Widow” on the move, that means a domino effect, pushing most all upcoming Marvel releases back at least three months.\n'TOP GUN: MAVERICK' RELEASE DATE DELAYED UNTIL DECEMBER\n“Black Widow” took the release date of “The Eternals,” which now moves to February 21 next year. “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" departs that February date for May 7, 2021. “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” shifts from next May to Nov. 5, 2021. And “Thor: Love and Thunder” is pushed three months, to Feb. 18, 2022.\n\n      This image released by Disney/Marvel Studios' shows Scarlett Johansson in a scene from \"Black Widow.\" .\n      (Marvel Studios/Disney via AP)\n\n\nDisney isn't abandoning the summer completely. “Mulan,” which been scheduled for March and already had its red carpet premiere, will now open July 24. That release date, of course, is subject to movie theaters being reopened by then and the pandemic subsiding.\nMOVIES BEING RELEASED EARLY ON DEMAND AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\nWhile Disney shifted nearly all of its big-budget movies, it's going to send one to its streaming service. The Kenneth Branagh-directed science fiction adventure adaptation “Artemis Fowl\" will go to Disney Plus instead of opening in theaters. The movie had originally been slate for release last August but had been rescheduled for May of this year. With the exception of Universal's “Trolls World Tour,” the major studios have chosen to delay their top releases rather than push them to digital release and sacrifice box-office revenue.\n\n      Chinese actress Liu Yifei is playing Mulan in Disney's upcoming live-action movie.\n      (Stephen Tilley/Disney Enterprises, Inc.)\n\n\nTV SHOWS, MOVIES AFFECTED BY CORONAVIRUS: FROM 'THE BATMAN' TO 'STRANGER THINGS'\n“Jungle Cruise,” with Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, is being pushed back a full year to July 30, 2021. The release of the fifth “Indiana Jones” movie, which Steven Spielberg last month departed as director with James Mangold replacing him, is also being delayed a full year, to July 2022. Harrison Ford will be 80 years old by then.\nWes Anderson's “The French Dispatch” is also postponed from July to Oct. 16.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "categories":

He added that whether Weinstein was ever given a COVID-19 test remains uncomfirmed.\nHARVEY WEINSTEIN MOVED TO NY STATE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON\n\n      Harvey Weinstein arrives at the Manhattan Criminal Court, on February 24, 2020 in New York City. \n      (Getty)\n\n\n\"He is fine,\" Juda S. Engelmayer told Fox News on Friday. \"There was never confirmation one way or another [on the test].\"\nEngelmayer's comments come a little over a week after he told Fox News that the real issue the former producer is facing is his new life behind bars.\n\"He's [physically] well,\" the spokesman said on March 26. \"It's prison he is having a hard time adjusting to.\"\nWeinstein, the Oscar-winning producer of “Shakespeare in Love,” was convicted of raping an aspiring actress in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006.

After his March 11 sentencing, he returned to the hospital with more chest pains.\nIn addition to heart issues, Weinstein’s lawyers have said he is also dealing with the ramifications of unsuccessful

Brian Kemp said Wednesday that he had just learned this week that the coronavirus can be contagious before people are showing symptoms, citing that fact as part of the reason why he ordered a more strict shelter-in-place order for his state after previously balking on doing so -- yet the White House had said so as early as Jan. 31.\n\"I think as the reason I'm taking these actions it's like I've continued to tell people I'm following the data, I'm following the advice of Dr. Toomey,\" Kemp told reporters Wednesday, referencing Dr. Kathleen Toomey, the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health. \"Her and I both mentioned in our remarks, you know, finding out that this virus is now transmitting before people see signs so what we've been telling people from directives from the CDC for weeks now that if you start feeling bad, stay home -- those individuals could have been infecting people before they even felt bad.\"\nKemp, a Republican, continued: \"But we didn't know that until the last 24 hours and as Dr. Toomey told me, she goes, 'this is a game-changer for us.'\"\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\nTRUMP SLAMS 'PARTISAN' PROBES AFTER PELOSI ANNOUNCES CORONAVIRUS COMMITTEE: 'HERE WE GO AGAIN'\nBut Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the most recognizable faces of the White House coronavirus response, had disclosed that \"game-changer\" detail in January.\n\"You know that, in the beginning, we were not sure if there were asymptomatic infection, which would make it a much broader outbreak than what we’re seeing,\" Fauci said. \"Now we know for sure that there are.\"\nKemp closed all public K-12 schools this week.\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health released a statement on Thursday that seemed to address and attempt to justify Kemp's Wednesday comments, which have been widely panned online, with one outlet suggesting he's either \"lying or incompetent.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"For weeks it has been known that people who were positive for COVID-19 but did not have symptoms likely were able to transmit the virus,\" the release said. \"However, on March 30, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield, M.D., confirmed that new data indicates that as many as 25% of individuals infected with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic. Additionally, science also now informs us that individuals who are symptomatic, are infectious up to 48 hours before symptoms appear.\"\nOn Wednesday, just three hours before Kemp's press conference, the CDC shared information that seemed to further confirm what Fauci had said in January -- that the coronavirus can be contagious in people who do not have symptoms.\n\"New @CDCMMWR report on #COVID19 in Singapore shows that some clusters of cases likely resulted from people without symptoms spreading illness,\" the agency tweeted. \"Social distancing and avoiding crowds are key to slowing

Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., who was criticized for dumping stocks after receiving a briefing from two members of President Trump's coronavirus task force.\n\"New congressional disclosures show that Loeffler sold far more stock than we initially knew,\" the \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" host began. \"Between Feb. 26 and March 11, Loeffler and her husband dumped almost 19 million dollars of stock in Intercontinental Exchange. That's the company her husband runs.\n\"During that same period, the couple also sold more than a million dollars in shares of other companies, including several retailers. Meanwhile, they bought a lot of DuPont [stock]. DuPont manufactures antiviral protective gear.\"\nSCHUMER CALLS FOR ETHICS REVIEW OF SENATORS' PRE-CORONAVIRUS STOCK SALES \nLoeffler defended her stock trades Wednesday by stressing that her investment portfolio is “managed independently by third-party advisors [sic].\" The trades disclosures were first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.\n\"So did Loeffler know any of this was happening? We don't know the answer to that,\" Carlson said. \"We do know that on March 10, after almost all these trades were done, she went on Twitter to assure her constituents that everything was fine.\"\n\"The good news is the consumer is strong. The economy is strong. Jobs are growing,\" Loeffler said in a video posted to Twitter on that date. \"Our president has done a fantastic job in making sure that we're in the best position to manage through this situation.\"\n\"Again, we don't know the truth,\" Carlson said, \"but if Loeffler knew about these trades and still issued the little PSA we showed you, she should leave office.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\nLoeffler denied wrongdoing in a March 20 interview conducted by Carlson.\nThe host also said a federal investigation should take place into Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., who executed similar trades to Loeffler's around the same time.\nFox News' Brooke Singman and Edmunde DeMarche contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": true,

Pritzker slams 'profoundly unamerican' 'racist speech' about coronavirus, in apparent swipe at Trump\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the daily news briefings by President Trump and the White House coronavirus task force, daily updates from top governors -- from Andrew Cuomo of New York to J.B. Pritzker of Illinois -- have emerged as must-see events in this COVID-19 pandemic.\nPritzker, a first-term liberal Democrat, blasted Trump this past March before the two got into a Twitter feud about the administration's response.\nLeading the Land of Lincoln, the 43rd governor of Illinois compared Trump to a \"carnival barker\" before the two got on the phone and the president promised the state of Illinois 250,000 masks and 300 ventilators.\nPritzker extended the state's stay-at-home order through the end of April in keeping with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] recommendations, as well as keeping schools closed. He also sent the National Guard to Stateville Correctional Center after one inmate died from the coronavirus.\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW \nThe state has seen at least 6,980 confirmed cases and 146 deaths from COVID-19.\nHe is the wealthiest governor in American history\nPritzker, named after his uncles Jay and Bob, \"J.B.,\" had an estimated personal net worth of $3.4 billion and more private wealth than any other governor in U.S. history. He is the second-wealthiest politician to ever hold office behind former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nPrior to becoming governor, he was co-founder and managing partner of the Pritzker Group in Chicago and is a member of the Pritzker family, who largely owns the Hyatt hotel chain and has been near the top of the Forbes \"America's Richest Families\" list since it started in 1982.\nHe was first elected in 2018\nPritzker unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois' 9th congressional district in 1998, spending half a million dollars from his own pockets. He finished third among five candidates in the Democratic primary.\nThen, in 2008, he served as Hillary Clinton's national co-chairman for the campaign and helped bring the Clinton and Obama campaigns together in Illinois.\nIllinois voters elected him governor in 2018; he took office in January 2019.\nBlagojevich consulted him to replace Obama's seat\nIn 2017, the Chicago Tribune published an 11-minute FBI wiretap between then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich and Pritzker from 2008, showing the two discussing campaign contributions and a potential appointment of Pritzker to a state office.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAt the time, Pritzker said he had \"not done anything wrong,\" but he later apologized for a number of controversial and incendiary comments made in a private conversation with Blagojevich as the two discussed who would fill then-President Obama's U.S. Senate seat in 2008.\nHe was recorded as saying that appointing then-Secretary of State Jesse White would \"cover you on the African-American thing\" and that he was the \"least offensive\" candidate.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB12-2",

She kept one mask for each one of our family members and then donated the rest to local hospitals.”\nBrinkley said her mother is continuously working to “find supplies and keep hospital workers safe as well,” adding that the legendary model is also donating 30 percent of her brand’s proceeds to the Direct Relief Foundation, an organization at the frontlines of providing hospitals with masks and other personal protective equipment.\nTRUMP PUSHES TO BRING BACK ENTERTAINMENT TAX DEDUCTIONS AMID CORONAVIRUS\nBrinkley maintained that she and her boyfriend each have just “one mask,” adding that in addition to being grateful to have one, they’re also “donating daily to organizations helping to create masks.”\n“When we go to the grocery store or out on a walk we wear them so that god forbid if we might have [COVID-19] and don’t know we don’t spread it to someone less able to fight it off,” she said. “Please stop sending me hateful messages, and stay safe❤️.”\n\n      Model Sailor Brinkley and professional dancer Val Chmerkovskiy compete on 'Dancing with the Stars.'\n      (Getty)\n\n\nOn Monday, Christie Brinkley revealed in an interview with “Extra” that Sailor had been responsible for the fact that she had been traveling extensively prior to the outbreak and was keeping her distance from the family for everyone’s safety.\nCELEBRITIES WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS\n“My son is with me. My daughters are -- don't even get me started, I'm missing them so much. And I'm so worried about them. They're both in the city,” the supermodel told the program via FaceTime.\n“But Sailor was touring with ‘Dancing with the Stars,’” Brinkley explained. “And she was meeting with crowds of people every night, hugging everybody so she said, 'Mom, there is no way I'm coming home until I'm 100 percent sure I haven't contracted anything.’\"\nHOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?\nBrinkley later added of Sailor and her other daughter, musician Alexa Ray Joel: “Of course, I want my babies here.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB18-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

That runoff was originally scheduled for this Tuesday, but due to coronavirus, was postponed until July 14.\nSessions previously held the Senate seat he is running for, which Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., now holds before he vacated it to become Trump’s attorney general.\nBefore their relationship soured, Sessions was one of Trump's most prominent supporters -- he was the first senator to endorse Trump's presidential campaign in 2016. But the president fired Sessions as his attorney general in November 2018 after frustration over Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation.\nLast month, Sessions responded to Trump’s endorsement of Tuberville by tweeting that the president “can endorse anyone he chooses for the U.S. Senate election in Alabama. But the Constitution expressly empowers the people of Alabama, and only them, to select their Senator. I intend to take my case directly to the people of Alabama.”\nFox News was unable to reach Sessions for comment on Thursday.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links":

(James D. Morgan/Getty Images)\n      \n\n\nOn Thursday, a 66-year-old man was evacuated from the Ruby Princess for medical care, according to The Guardian, after New South Wales (NSW) Ministry of Health authorities and an independent health care team boarded the ocean liner for medical evaluations of the crew, amid concerns that some may be infected with the novel coronavirus. Six crew members from the Ruby Princess have already been hospitalized after falling ill, though their exact diagnoses remain unclear.\nCRUISING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: SHOULD I CANCEL MY CRUISE? WHAT PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I TAKE?\nMore recently, about 250 crew members were \"experiencing sickness\" and isolating themselves, per 9News.\nReuters has similarly described the situation aboard the Ruby Princess as “Australia’s worst coronavirus outbreak.”\n\n      The Ruby Princess is seen off the coast of Sydney on March 24.

Though the Australian government has ordered the ships to leave during the coronavirus crisis, they have refused to comply, according to The Guardian.\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n      The Ruby Princess departs Sydney Harbour with no passengers and only crew on board as it passes the Opera House on March 19.

systems, per the outlet.\n“We know around the world that when the hospital systems become overwhelmed, then lots and lots of people die,” Fuller said.\nAn additional update on the developing operation

Despite the fact that I was covered in blood, I caught her eye and bounced my brows like Groucho Marx. Hubba hubba. Cher was bashful to be busted but then couldn’t help laughing out loud at the audacity.\n“Here we were, joking about beauty and desire, while I looked like a stunt man from Tarantino’s ‘Reservoir Dogs’ and, yes, while my life seemed to be in mortal danger,” added Kilmer. “We laughed out loud before they finished with my vitals and shut me up with an oxygen mask.”\nAccording to the outlet, Kilmer underwent a tracheotomy, chemotherapy and radiation.

However, he’s keeping busy by doing voice exercises every day. In addition, he’s been touring with his one-man show about Mark Twain and this summer he will reprise his role in the “Top Gun” sequel “Maverick.” The film is slated to open in theaters on June

The fire was suspected to be an arson, but no one was charged.\nWhat the documentary doesn’t cover is the fact that the animals that died are believed to have been previously owned by Jackson on his Neverland Ranch.\nCORONAVIRUS PREVENTION TIPS: HOW TO STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE\n\n      Animals that died in an alleged arson at Joe Exotic's zoo in 2015 reportedly belonged to Michael Jackson.\n      \n\n\n“As most of you know, an arsonist hit our facility a day before yesterday in the sometime wee hours and set fire to not only my recording studio but the studio that houses our alligators, which caused them all to burn up and perish, boiling alive in a towering inferno of nothing but flames and fire,” Joe said in a JoeExoticTV YouTube video, published on March 28, 2015.\nAt the time of the fire, Joe told the Los Angeles Times that seven of the alligators and a crocodile that died in the fire were taken from Neverland following its closure. New York Magazine reported in September 2019 that baby alligators were killed in the fire that were the offspring of an alligator that lived with Jackson at Neverland.\nWHY DO SOME COUNTRIES STILL HAVE NEXT TO NO RECORDED OUTBREAKS OF CORONAVIRUS?\nRepresentatives for Jackson’s estate did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\n\n      Joe Exotic is currently serving time in connection with a murder-for-hire plot. \n      (Santa Rosa County Jail via AP, File)\n\n\nThe documentary sees those involved with Joe’s story posit several theories as to who started the fire, with some even believing that Joe started it himself in an effort to destroy potentially damaging footage that was being housed in the recording studio for a potential reality show that was being filmed. Joe has denied those rumors.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nJoe is currently behind bars after being found guilty of hatching a murder-for-hire plot in which he paid $3,000 for one of the

Sign up here. \nDr. Sarosh Janjua, a cardiologist who was caught speeding by a Minnesota state trooper and was \"issued\" five brand new N95 masks instead of a ticket, said on “Fox  Friends” on Wednesday that she “needed to be reminded that ultimately it’s not toilet paper and N95 masks that are going to save us, it’s each other.”\nJanjua said she lives in Massachusetts and was working on temporary assignment in Minnesota last month.\nOn March 21, Janjua was headed to Minneapolis after getting off work at Essentia Health in Duluth when she was pulled over by Trooper Brian Schwartz for going 85 mph in a 70 mph zone, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Monday. \nOne week after she was pulled over, Janjua described what happened during the traffic stop in a Facebook post. \n“I waited for him to write me a ticket. Instead, he told me he was going to let me off with a warning,” Janjua wrote.\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\nShe said he then handed her what she assumed was her license back, but were “five N95 masks, from the supply the state had given him for his protection.”\nDoctors and nurses at U.S. hospitals treating coronavirus patients have reported a shortage of N95 masks, making them a priceless commodity.\n“I burst into tears. And though it may just have been the cold wind, I think he teared up a little as well, before wishing me well and walking away,” Janjua wrote in the post. \nSpeaking via FaceTime on Wednesday, Janjua said, “It’s been very isolating to take care of suspected COVID-19 patients.\n“It’s hard to look at stories of selfishness and hoarding,” she continued. “Whenever you turn on the news it seems like there are more stories of people clearing the shelves and keeping things for themselves rather than giving them away and, I think particularly at that time, I really needed to believe that we’re going to stay together as human beings and I needed to be reminded that ultimately it’s not toilet paper and N95 masks that are going to save us, it’s each other.” \nJanjua’s Facebook post has gone viral and, as of Wednesday, had more than 29,000 views and was shared more than 23,000 times. \nReacting to the response on social media, she said, “I think the emotional and psychological health of this nation has declined quite a bit over the last couple of weeks especially and it can be very hard to just be locked up at home and just listen to the news and just look at all the scary numbers and we’re not interacting the way we normally do to reassure ourselves about things.\n“I think people just needed to hear a good story,” she continued. “They needed to hear that we are going to be there for each other.” \nMinnesota State Patrol thanked Janjua in a Facebook post on Sunday, writing, “Thank you to Sarosh for her hard work and dedication. Troopers are working hard during the pandemic and are thinking about all the first responders who are caring for Minnesotans during this critical time.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n“It was humbling,” Janjua continued. “I think state troopers and policemen, they often get a very bad rap simply for doing their jobs and I just think that it’s time they got their due recognition.” \n Fox News’ Robert Gearty contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB12-3",

Douglas Linn Hickok, who was a drilling guardsman and physician’s assistant for the National Guard, was in \"great health\" before he tested positive for COVID-19.\nNATIONAL GUARDSMAN IS 1ST US SERVICE MEMBER TO DIE FROM CORONAVIUS, ESPER ANNOUNCES\nHe had recently passed the Army’s annual physical fitness test but had a history of lung cancer, his daughter said.\nHickok had received an MRI earlier in March to ensure he was still cancer-free. In the past, the dye from the scan had caused him to get a fever and when it happened again, her father was not initially worried, she said. But other symptoms developed rapidly and he checked into Lehigh Valley Hospital in the Poconos, in Pennsylvania, on March 21. He died a week later.\nHickock is the first U.S. service member to die from coronavirus.\nPrior to getting infected with the virus, Hickok had attended a “pre-scheduled” National Guard training session on COVID-19 in Sea Girt, N.J. The family does not know how, where or when Hickok became infected. \n\"All of us in the National Guard are grateful for his service to our nation, as a Citizen and as a Soldier,\" Gen. Joseph Lengyel, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\"As our nation fights its greatest challenge in recent memory, we are all going to need to draw on our inner strength and resilience to win this war and comfort those in pain. We will prevail -- and we each must bring our best selves to the task every day to overcome this as fast as possible for our great country.\"\nA third-generation military member, Hickok enlisted in the New Jersey National Guard medical unit in 2009, according to his obituary.\nHe then moved to Maryland to work as a civilian physician assistant at Andrews Air force Base.\n“He was a patriot,” his daughter said.\nIn 2017, he moved to Pennsylvania and worked as an orthopedic physician assistant at a clinic.\nHickok held a Physician Assistant Medical degree with a specialty in orthopedic surgery from Cornell Medical School in New York City.\nHe was an avid baseball player and a \"big fan of Fox News and was watching until the end,\" his daughter said.\n“Sean Hannity was his favorite,” she added. “He would text me the clips all day, he loved all of you.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n“Fair and accurate news media was important to him,” his obituary says. “Doug was loyal to his God, faith and country.”", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB12-2", "parent":

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) - A painting by Dutch master Vincent van Gogh was stolen in an overnight smash-and-grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, police and the museum said Monday.\nThe Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam said \"The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884\" by the Dutch master was taken in the early hours of Monday. By early afternoon, all that could be seen from the outside of the museum was a large white panel covering a smashed door in the building's glass facade.\n\n      This image released by the Gronninger Museum on Monday March 30, 2020, shows Dutch master Vincent van Gogh's painting titled \"The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring.\" (Groninger Museum via AP Photo)\n      \n\n\nMuseum General Director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is \"angry, shocked, sad\" at the theft.\nThe value of the work, which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, was not immediately known. Van Gogh's paintings, when they rarely come up for sale, fetch millions at auction.\nCLICK FOR LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\nPolice are investigating the theft.\n\"I'm shocked and unbelievably annoyed that this has happened,\" said Singer Laren museum director Jan Rudolph de Lorm.\n\n      Two people look at the glass door which was smashed during a break-in at the Singer Museum in Laren, Netherlands. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)\n      \n\n\n\"This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen - removed from the community,\" he added. \"It is very bad for the Groninger Museum, it is very bad for the Singer, but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us, the community, to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from, especially in these difficult times.\"\nThe 10-by-22-inch oil on paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background.\nIt dates to a time when the artist had moved back to his family in a rural area of the Netherlands and painted the life he saw there, including his famous work \"The Potato Eaters,\" in mostly somber tones.\nLater, he moved to southern France, where he developed a far more colorful, vibrant style of painting as his health declined before his death in 1890.\nPolice said in a statement that the thief or thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum. That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it were gone.\nA team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbors. Van Os said the museum's security worked \"according to protocol,\" but he added: \"Obviously we can learn from this.\"\nThe Dutch government on March 12 banned large crowds among its measures to halt the spread of the virus, leading several museums to close temporarily.\nBefore the closure, the museum was hosting an exhibition titled \"Mirror of the Soul\" with works by artists ranging from Jan Toorop to Piet Mondrian, in cooperation with Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.\nThe Singer Laren's collection has a focus on modernism such as neo-impressionism, pointillism, expressionism and cubism.\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt is not the first high profile theft from the museum. In 2007, thieves stole seven works from its sculpture garden, including a bronze cast of \"The Thinker\" by Auguste Rodin. The famous sculpture was recovered a few days later, missing a leg.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB10-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

OK, go ahead,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"Everyone should follow the laws. I am not against it, I know that fighters need to feed their families and pay their bills.\n“I know how hard it is for the fighter,” he added. “Unless they fight they aren't getting any money.

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\n\n\n\nJon Bon Jovi is lending a helping hand to Prince Harry.\nThe 58-year-old rock star recently re-recorded his song \"Unbroken,\" originally used for a documentary, as a single for Prince Harry's Invictus Games, featuring a choir from the games.\n\"I was called upon to write that song for a documentary in America, it came out late last year, called 'To Be of Service,'\" Bon Jovi told Entertainment Tonight. \"And though I had never served, it was going to be a daunting task. I was the narrator, talking about soldiers with PTSD and service dogs. Difficult song to write. But even as I was writing it for this documentary, I thought on a parallel course about the Invictus Games and the British soldiers.\"\nPRINCE WILLIAM, KATE MIDDLETON ENCOURAGE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AMID 'UNSETTLING' CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\nThe Invictus Games are a series of adaptive sports competitions in the U.K. for disabled veterans. The event was created by Harry, 35.\n\"So I sent it to Prince Harry knowing that they had this choir,\" continued Bon Jovi. \"And after months of getting up and through the changing hymn, he loved the idea.\"\nThen came the announcement that Harry and Markle, 38, had chosen to \"step back\" from their royal duties, which Bon Jovi thought indicated the end of his partnership with the prince.\n\"But I got a call two days later saying, 'Oh, no, no, no, not only is it not falling apart but it's the first thing on his docket when he comes back. We're doing this,'\" said the \"It's My Life\" singer.\nQUEEN ELIZABETH 'ALWAYS PROTECTED' HER SISTER PRINCESS MARGARET DESPITE MEDIA SCRUTINY, ROYAL BUTLER SAYS\nHe added: \"So I went to England before COVID took over. We went to the famed Abbey Road Studios and with the Invictus choir re-recorded the band's song and released it today with them, for them, as a battle cry for all those men and women who have served.\"\nCoronavirus concerns have caused this year's Invictus Games to be delayed until 2021.\n\n      Prince Harry and Jon Bon Jovi collaborating on \"Unbroken\" for the Invictus Games.  (Photo by HANNAH MCKAY/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n      \n\n\nNews recently broke that Markle and Harry have relocated from Canada to Los Angeles, but Bon Jovi said he didn't offer much in the way of advice to the royal duo upon their move.\n\"It's not for me to give advice to a man like that. They’ve got it figured out,\" Bon Jovi said. \"It was a real pleasure to work with him and to get to know him a little bit.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I’ve met his brother before and I’ve met his dad before. I met his grandma before,\" explained the musician. \"I’ve performed for all of them over the years. So this completed the circle. I wish them both all the very best.

But I think it’s not even questionable today that we’re going to need two more weeks of nonessential workers.\"\nCuomo announced the development of a “less intrusive saliva and short nasal swab test” for coronavirus that could be given by health care workers that may be available as early as next week, heralding this as a step in the right direction.\n“People ask when is this over, I think the testing, you tell me when they come up with an inexpensive home test or point of care test that can be brought to volume, I think that’s probably when you see a real return to normalcy in the

not to allow New Yorkers into their state.\n\"I know we feel under attack,\" Cuomo said. \"No one is going to attack New York unfairly, and no one is going to deprive New York of what it needs.\"\nTrump ended up not ordering a quarantine, and Rhode Island repealed its order.\nCuomo also addressed the struggles families will face in the coming weeks with the Easter and Passover holidays, which are typically celebrated with religious services and family gatherings.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Worship the way you can, but the gatherings are just not a good idea,” he

Once aboard Rotterdam, all guests will continue to remain in their staterooms until disembarkation. Any guests who are currently ill, or in isolation as a close contact, and all crew will remain on Zaandam.”\nIncluded among those feeling ill are 53 passengers and 85 crew members.

The launch window had opened at 2:57 p.m. ET, but the launch time was pushed back while engineers dealt with a ground hydraulics issue.\nAEHF-6 is the sixth and final satellite in the Space Force’s AEHF constellation. “AEHF satellites provide global, survivable, protected communications capabilities for strategic command and tactical warfighters operating on ground, sea and air platforms,” ULA explained on its website.\nAMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, SPACEX LAUNCH OF ARGENTINIAN SATELLITE POSTPONED\nThe AEHF-6 proceeded despite the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. A SpaceX satellite launch that had been scheduled for later this month has been postponed amid the pandemic.\n\n      A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket lifts off from launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station with a payload of a high frequency satellite Thursday, March 26, 2020, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Built by Lockheed Martin, this U.S. military spacecraft will provide highly-secure communications.\n      (AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\n\nThe SAOCOM1B satellite is being launched for Argentina’s Space Agency, the Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket had originally been scheduled for March 30 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\nArgentinian officials cited travel restrictions as the reason for the delayed launch of the Earth observation satellite.\nCORONAVIRUS MAY DELAY NASA'S RETURN TO THE MOON\nThe impact of the coronavirus outbreak on space exploration programs is being closely followed. Earlier this month, for example, the European Space Agency and the Russian space agency Roscosmos announced that the launch of the second ExoMars mission is being postponed to 2022, in part because of the pandemic.\n\n      CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - MARCH 25, 2020: A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with an Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications satellite for a payload is seen the day before its scheduled March 26, 2020 launch at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n      (Paul Hennessy / Echoes Wire/Barcroft Media via Getty Images)\n\n\nThe European Space Agency also said Tuesday that it is putting eight of its spacecraft into hibernation as it scales down operations during the coronavirus outbreak.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNASA has also temporarily suspended work on the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope in California due to the coronavirus, putting its spring 2021 target launch date in jeopardy.\nFollow James Rogers on

The online race is in place of the canceled Homestead-Miami NASCAR Cup race, which was axed due to the coronavirus.\n\n\n\n\nNASCAR’s shift into the virtual world was a success.\nThe first race of the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series that was organized to fill the void created by the suspended NASCAR season pulled in 903,000 viewers on Fox Sports One on Sunday, making it the most-watched sports broadcast on cable that day.\nThe numbers were way down from the over 4.5 million viewers the last three NASCAR races before the hiatus had, but were more than enough to make it the highest-rated televised eSports event ever.\nThe network has now committed to carrying the entire season, which will continue until NASCAR gets back on track sometime after May 3 when coronavirus restrictions are eased, with the broadcast team of Mike Joy, Jeff Gordon and Larry McReynolds calling the races.\nThe inaugural 100-lap event featured drivers from the NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Truck series -- including Kyle Busch, Joey Logano and Jimmie Johnson -- competing on an iRacing simulator and saw Denny Hamlin hold off Dale Earnhardt Jr. to take the checkered flag on a digital version of Homestead-Miami speedway.\nThe drivers were racing from remote locations in their homes and garages and were allowed one crew member to help them out. Denny Hamlin won despite driving shoeless and having a bottle of soda that was handed to him by his daughter spray all over his hands and a $40,000 driving rig.\nThe next race is scheduled for Sunday, March 29 at 1 pm ET at Texas Motor Speedway, where Hamlin won in the real world last year.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-22", "level": 2,

In exchange, the Taliban would release 1,000 Afghani prisoners.\nBut, one day after the peace deal was signed, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected the notion of releasing Afghan prisoners as a precondition for peace negotiations. The impasse threatened the historic peace agreement which included the withdrawal of the bulk of foreign forces from Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.\nAFGHAN GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE 1,500 TALIBAN PRISONERS, MAJOR STEP IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS \nOn March 10, Ghani agreed to release 1,500 prisoners as a precondition to talks with the Taliban -- and an additional 500 prisoners every two weeks after talks began until the number reached 5,000. It was unclear whether the Taliban would accept the deal, as they previously had refused to speak to the Afghan government until all prisoners were released.\n\"Everyone knows clearly that the threat of Coronavirus makes the release of prisoners urgent,\" U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted.\n“All sides reaffirmed their firm commitment to reducing violence, inter-Al-Afghani negotiations, and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire. We also agreed on the next technical meeting in the next couple of days,” Khalilzad added.\n“Everyone clearly understands the coronavirus threat makes prisoner releases that much more urgent,” he said. “All sides conveyed their strong commitment to a reduction of violence, intra-Afghan negotiations, and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.”\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Taliban’s Doha office spokesman Suhail Shaheen confirmed the meeting on Twitter but stressed it was only about the release of prisoners.\nThe Afghan government and the Taliban have sparred often over the past few days, including a storming of the Afghan military base on Friday, which investigators blamed on the insurgent group.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2,

On Jan. 21, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the United States. Just 10 days later, on Jan. 31, President Trump declared a public health emergency, implemented quarantines and announced a ban on travel to and from China.\nOn the very same day, Biden called the president’s response “hysterical xenophobia”, and “fear-mongering”. To this day, Biden is STILL against travel bans of any kind — even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the bans saved us from untold amounts of suffering.\nIn the days and weeks after Jan. 31, the Trump administration organized a massive public-private partnership, implemented brand new drive-up testing sites, engaged the U.S. military for support, cut red tape across the board to speed up research and development, and declared a national emergency.\nMy message to Joe Biden is simple: If you refuse to be a part of the solution, you might consider heading to a church (reminder – it’s Sunday, not “Super Thursday”), and pray to… “you know the thing.” \nThe response is unprecedented, but pandemics are not.\nIn April 2009, during the H1N1 outbreak (or N1H1, as Biden mistakenly called it), Obama’s Health and Human Services Department quickly declared a public health emergency. However, the Obama/Biden administration failed to declare a national emergency until October 2009.\nBy that point, over 1,000 Americans had been killed by the disease and tens of thousands more were infected. In the first year of the H1N1 pandemic, nearly 13,000 Americans lost their lives.\nUltimately, over 60 million Americans contracted the virus, and hundreds of thousands were hospitalized.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThe Obama/Biden administration NEVER implemented a mandatory quarantine. The Obama/Biden administration NEVER enacted a travel ban. The Obama/Biden administration NEVER created drive-up testing sites.\nSomeone might want to remind Vice President Biden.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nClearly, he’s doesn’t remember his administration’s lackluster response in 2009, or perhaps, he still doesn’t understand the seriousness of a worldwide pandemic. Because now, instead of lending support, he’s using this crisis as a political weapon. In fact, his campaign is fundraising off of COVID-19. Yes, Biden is actually trying to raise money in the middle of a pandemic.\nMy message to Joe Biden is simple: If you refuse to be a part of the solution, you might consider heading to a virtual church (reminder – it’s Sunday, not “Super Thursday”), and pray to… “you know the thing” (God the Creator of everything). Or, perhaps, you could just ask your son, Hunter “Zero experience” Biden, for some of his millions, so you can travel the world, and let the adults respond to this crisis in a serious manner. By the way, if you’re wondering who to blame for the outbreak, ask your son.

A British consumer report in April 2019 found that many tech products were being boosted by fake reviews. Just 24 pairs of headphones contained 10,000 reviews from unverified purchasers, a strong sign of being fake.\nHIV DRUGS DON'T WORK AS CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT, CLINICAL TRIAL REVEALS\n\n      Andrea Wyatt of Inglewood, Calif., wears a mask as she collects her concessions at the Paramount Drive-In Theatres, Thursday, March 19, 2020, in Paramount, Calif.

Edward Markey, D-Mass., sent the FTC a letter that urged the agency to crack down on online scams related to COVID-19.\n\"The FTC should not allow any consumer to suffer from a scam or predatory business practice during this public health emergency,\" the letter states.\nSaoud Khalifah, the founder and CEO of Fakespot, a firm using machine learning to find fake reviews and fraud as a way to make online shopping more transparent, told Gizmodo the third-party sellers \"are using fake reviews to pump their product when people search for antiviral masks. Our system gives all the aforementioned examples F and D grade for fraud and people should be wary buying them.”\nCHLOROQUINE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT POTENTIAL CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT\nAccording to Gizmodo, Fakespot uses a database of over 6 billion reviews to train a machine learning model to “recognize patterns of inauthenticity and deception” in Amazon listings.\nFox News reached out to Amazon for comment on this story.\nAmazon told sellers last week that the platform would be blocking new listings for face masks, hand sanitizer, or other coronavirus-related products.

The suspension also impacts its hiring and onboarding process, though officials emphasize their recruitment website will remain open as they may need more employees than originally planned for.\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\nAccording to a statement released by the Census Bureau, “in late May, census takers around the nation will begin visiting households that have not yet responded to the 2020 Census to help complete the count.”\nIt’s a month later than Census takers were supposed to start knocking on doors of households that had not yet responded.\n“Respond on your own, so a Census worker does not need to come to your household,” Olson said. \n\n      Census officials expect field operations to resume April 1.\n      \n\n\nFortunately, Census officials say they’ve already exceeded their expected response rate. So far, about 18.6 million households have sent their forms in.\n“I think people are realizing this is a big deal,” Olson said. \nThe Census officially kicked off March 12 and by March 20, every U.S. household is supposed to have received their mail-in Census forms. That envelope will include instructions on how to complete the Census form online, on paper or over the phone. \n“It certainly will impact our operations and everyone’s operations,” said Stephanie Reid, Philly Count’s executive director.\nMost major cities have committees such as Philly Counts to engage with the local community. Its Philadelphia office of nearly 20 people is also impacted.\n“We are all working from home. And we do virtual meetings, a Zoom meeting every day,” Reid said.\n\n      Stephanie Reid, Philly Count's Executive Director, works from home amid coronavirus concerns.\n      \n\n\nReid says a major focus now is college students.\n“College students should still be counted where they go to school, and I know this is going to be confusing for people because students have gone home now,” Reid explained. \nThe upcoming outreach events Philly Counts had planned are now stripped from the calendar, so the committee is brainstorming virtual ways to reach people.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n“I think that we are looking at how do we continue and keep the momentum going and have online events,” Reid added.\nCensus officials are still hoping to submit all the collected data to the president by December 2020.\nAll operational updates are expected to be released on its website.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

It also allows them to pledge a wider range of collateral in return for the loans. The funds will then mostly be used to purchase commercial paper.\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n“We’re living in a different world, like the 1930s in which 1930s, 1932, you have a devaluation of the dollar.

Cuomo are just two officials considering how to address this issue.\n\n\n\n\nKansas GOP lawmakers on Wednesday moved to limit their Democratic governor’s emergency powers during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that they are an overreaction that is fueling panic and an unnecessary intrusion into people’s lives. \nThe pushback came after Gov. Laura Kelly announced Tuesday that all public schools will be closed for the remainder of the school year and classes will be held remotely to curb the spread of the coronavirus. \n\n      Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly answers questions from reporters after announcing that she'd order all public and private K-12 schools in the state to close for the rest of the semester, Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan.\n      (AP)\n\n\nConservative critics have suggested that Kelly's actions suggest she might go after firearms and try to limit their sale.\nKelly declared a state of emergency last week to mobilize state resources, but it will expire March 27 unless legislators pass a resolution extending it. Lawmakers are now set to have the GOP-controlled legislature's leaders scrutinize all of Kelly's future coronavirus orders and to give them the power to revoke many of them within days. \n\"There is a concern about civil liberties, a concern about the proper exercise of government authority and not wanting it to be too extreme,” House Speaker Pro Tem. Blaine Finch, who helped draft the final version, told fellow Republicans.\nThe House approved a version of the resolution last week as a straightforward extension of Kelly's state of emergency into January 2021. \nCURFEWS, CLOSURES AND MORE: WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN AND CAN'T DO IN A HEALTH EMERGENCY\nThe Senate on Wednesday passed its version limiting Kelly's power, 37-2. The two chambers then negotiated a compromise Wednesday night, with final votes in both chambers expected later Thursday.\nThe state of emergency would last until May 1, but legislative leaders could approve further extensions every 30 days.\nThe Senate-approved language from conservatives to strip Kelly of power governors have had in other emergencies. Among those powers is the authority to say who goes into or out of a disaster area and to restrict movement within an area. She also would lose the governor's broad power to act to \"promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nConservatives argued that Kelly's bold moves, and similar actions in other states, are unnecessarily torpedoing the economy and isolating people. \nDemocrats warned that the Senate's language could limit Kelly's ability to set up quarantine zones around communities in crisis. \nKansas has had more than 20 confirmed coronavirus cases and one COVID-19-related death. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Following President Donald Trump’s address earlier this week, I knew we would need to make the difficult decision of transitioning to remote-learning for a period of time.\nAt the end of this week, President Trump declared a national emergency in light of this pandemic. Now is the time for universities to consider all necessary precautions to secure the safety and health of their students.\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread in Florida, we decided to take all necessary measures to be responsive and, first and foremost, ensure the safety of our community.\nPETER NAVARRO: FACED WITH CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, CONGRESS SHOULD PASS TRUMP’S $800 BILLION PAYROLL TAX CUT\nThis past Friday, Southeastern University announced to our students that all face-to-face classes will transition to a remote-learning format.\nWe have chosen to close school on Monday, March 16, for students and faculty to prepare for this transition, which will take place from March 17 to April 13 until further notice.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nMany institutions of higher education, both private and state, are taking a similar approach. As they embark on this new strategy of education, many students may be concerned of the impact this will have on the remainder of their semester, including major events (such as graduation) and their individual academic success.\nBut, like many universities following a similar plan of action, for our campus this temporary shift to remote instruction will not change the academic calendar.\nAt Southeastern, our final exams, start and end dates for the semester, and our commitment to academic excellence will remain the same.\nMoving to a remote and virtual learning space, we are seeking to remain flexible and supportive of all of our students throughout this season. Similar to how other campuses are operating, faculty will continue to communicate directly with students as their classes progress forward, and remain on schedule.\nOf course, these transitions to remote instruction require patience and cooperation. Both parents and students may be alarmed by these developments, but these steps of action are being taken as a precaution. All of this is in an effort to contribute to the decrease of the spread of the coronavirus.\nOur teams continue to work diligently to accommodate this transition for our campus, and we are providing additional information as it becomes available. During this time, our administration, faculty and staff will continue to remain focused on their roles to see our students succeed.\nWhile the coming weeks present a very different way of doing life together as a university, we believe this season will only strengthen us further.\nIt is easy to allow stressful situations to get the best of us, and these uncertain times surely present a unique way of approaching education.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe trust, as I know many other state and private universities do as well, that we will make this transition to a new way of learning seamless and undisruptive, with every effort to ensure the academic success and health of our students.\nAt Southeastern University, we believe these difficult decisions have ultimately been made to best serve and support our students. After all, our sole purpose is to see them thrive.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\n\n\n\nTribeca Film Festival will no longer be taking place next month.\nThe 19th annual event for independent film was set for April 15 through April 26, but has been postponed because of coronavirus. No new dates have been announced.\n“We founded the Tribeca Film Festival as a way to heal our community after the devastation of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. We were determined to overcome our fear and anxiety by joining together.  It is in our DNA to march forward while caring about our community,” Jane Rosenthal, co-founder and CEO of Tribeca Enterprises, said in a statement. “We have made the difficult decision to postpone the 19th Tribeca Film Festival (April 15-26) based on the announcement by Gov. Andrew Cuomo that events of 500 people or more are banned due to the spread of the novel coronavirus. We are committed to ensuring the health and safety of the public while also supporting our friends, filmmakers and storytellers who look to Tribeca as a platform to showcase their work to audiences. We will be back to you shortly with our plans.”\nThe festival had selections from 12 filmmakers representing 33 countries. “Jimmy Carter Rock  Roll President” was set to open the festival on April 15 with a premiere screening at the Beacon Theatre and live performances from Willie Nelson and Nile Rodgers.\n‘FAST  FURIOUS 9’ RELEASE PUSHED BACK A YEAR DUE TO CORONAVIRUS\nThe lineup also included the U.S. premiere of “Bad Education” starring Hugh Jackman; the New York premiere of Judd Apatow’s comedy “The King of Staten Island” with Pete Davidson; Elisabeth Moss in “Shirley;” and “Call Your Mother” featuring Bridget Everett, Tig Notaro and Awkwafina. “Fries,” a documentary from Chrissy Teigen and Malcolm Gladwell, was to have its world premiere at the festival.\nThe competition included 10 U.S. narratives, 10 international narratives and 12 documentary competition features. Additionally, the lineup had 16 spotlight narratives, 20 spotlight documentaries, 17 viewpoints, five midnight and 13 movie plus selections.\n‘A QUIET PLACE 2’ RELEASE DELAYED AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\nThe short film lineup included 64 films from 20 countries.\nAbout 150,000 people were expected to attend this year.\n“First comes the story, then empathy, then comes change. When you change the narrator, you empower different voices to show audiences new worlds through their eyes,” Paula Weinstein, Chief Content Officer of Tribeca Enterprises and program advisor said in a statement when this year’s line-up was announced. “We are privileged to have so many new and rich worlds brought to life by visionary storytellers. We hope audiences leave the Festival deeply touched, moved, and entertained.”\nKIMMEL, CORDEN, SPADE LATE-NIGHT SHOWS WILL DROP LIVE CROWDS\nFor the first time, some festival programming was going to take place outside of Manhattan in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nThis story originally appeared in Variety.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB1-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Disinfectants “with 62-71 percent ethanol, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite” — bleach — was able to inactive the viruses within a minute, according to the study.\n“We expect a similar effect against the SARS-CoV-2,” or the novel coronavirus, researchers said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its website warns human coronaviruses most commonly spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, close contact with an infected person (shaking hands, for example), but also by touching an object or surface that has been exposed to the virus, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes with dirty hands.\nCOULD CORONAVIRUS BECOME A PANDEMIC? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CLASSIFICATION \nTransmission via inanimate objects sparked concerns that imported goods from China could pose a health risk. But an infectious disease expert previously told Fox News it’s unlikely the virus will survive the journey from China to your front door.\n“The virus on materials they ordered would not survive such a trip. Outside the body, we believe this virus only survives on [an] object minutes to an hour or so, not the days it takes your goods to travel the globe,”  Patricia A. Stinchfield, vice president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), told Fox News at the time. “As always after handling things, wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-15", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7-15", "parent":

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nFast-food companies operating in China have taken extraordinary steps to contain the spread of the coronavirus by ramping up “contactless” pickup and delivery services to keep both their workers and customers safe, Reuters reported Sunday.\nThe companies taking the extra precautions include McDonald’s, Starbucks and Kentucky Fried Chicken, the report said.\nMcDonald’s has instituted contactless pickup and delivery of Big Macs, fries and other menu items across the country as the outbreak has grown.\n\nAMERICANS QUARANTINED ON DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP OVER CORONAVIRUS FLOWN TO US; 14 INFECTED AND ISOLATED ON PLANE \nAs part of the plan, customers order remotely – by mobile phones or using computers in the restaurants – and employees seal the meals in bags and put them in a pre-arranged location for pickup without human contact, McDonald’s says on its website.\nDelivery order procedures have also undergone revisions as drivers now drop McDonald’s packages at building entrances, disinfect their delivery bags and wash their hands more frequently, the wire service reported. Drivers also now carry ID cards showing they - and the people who made and packaged their food - had their body temperature scanned to prove they do not have a fever.\n\n      An entrance to a closed McDonald's Corp. restaurant is barricaded near the famous West Lake, usually a popular tourist attraction, in Hangzhou, China, on Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2020. The death toll from the coronavirus climbed above 1,000, as the Chinese province at the epicenter of the outbreak reported its highest number of fatalities yet. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n      \n\n\nThe flu-like virus has infected more than 70,548 people globally and killed 1,770 as of Sunday, mostly in the central Chinese province of Hubei. \nIn early February, 83 percent of all stores on the Meituan-Dianping delivery platform - one of the largest in the country - were closed, according to Beijing-based data firm BigOne Lab.\n\nDR. MARC SIEGEL PRAISES US RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS AMID GLOBAL PANIC: 'WE'RE BEING PROTECTED'\nStarbucks has implemented procedures where customers order coffee via its app and then wait outside its cafés until receiving a pick-up notice, Reuters reported. Orders are placed on tables just inside café entrances.\nIf customers enter Starbucks locations, they must submit to having their temperature taken at the door, as fever is one of the main symptoms of infection, and baristas wear masks.\nFor delivery, Starbucks said it regularly sterilizes containers and its delivery people have their temperature taken daily, the report said. Indoors staff must wash hands every 30 minutes, and public areas are sterilized every two hours.\n\nCHINA SEES CORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL RISE BY 105\nMeanwhile, Yum China Holdings Inc rolled out contactless delivery on Jan. 30, with contactless pickup coming two days later at its KFC and Pizza Hut locations, the company said.\nChinese companies used contactless delivery prior to coronavirus, as couriers would drop packages at a consumer’s door or lobby or place parcels in lockers for later pickup.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut since the outbreak, many residential compounds are limiting access for drivers and asking customers to pick up their own packages.\nIn transactions that previously would have involved one person handing a package to the other, the driver now puts the food down – on the back of a moped, for instance – and then steps back and waits for the customer to take it and leave.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB8-4", "level": 2, "links":

mistake.\nOne of the men, Terrence Leroy, has now been acquitted of entering the home in July 2019 intending to intimidate while armed with an offensive weapon, after the New South Wales district court accepted his explanation.\nConceding \"the facts of the case are unusual,\" judge Sean Grant set out his reasons for the not guilty verdict, saying the evidence did not suggest the men's actions were intentional.\n\"They carried the machetes either as a prop or something to use in that fantasy,\" he said.\n\"The fantasy was unscripted and there was discretion as to how it would be carried

called out: \"B----- off, it's too early.\"\nAfter hearing a voice asking \"is your name Kevin?\" the man said he turned his light on to see two men he did not recognize standing next to his bed, both holding machetes.\nA conversation then ensued, in which the pair repeatedly sought to establish whether he was \"Kevin,\" each time being told \"no\" in response.\nAt one point, one of them asked:

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nLeaving his home in Wilmington, Del., for his first public trip anywhere since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered much of the country two months ago, former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill made an unannounced visit on Monday to attend a Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony.\nThe presumptive Democratic presidential nominee wore a black mask covering his mouth and nose during the ceremony at Veterans Memorial Park at the Delaware Memorial Bridge in New Castle, which is a short drive from Biden's home.\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\n      Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden and Jill Biden depart after placing a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veterans Memorial Park, Monday, May 25, 2020, in New Castle, Del. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n      \n\n\nThe Bidens placed a wreath of white flowers at the memorial, briefly spoke with the retired adjutant general of the Delaware National Guard, and saluted a small group of veterans before returning to their nearby motorcade, according to a press pool report.\n“Never forget the sacrifices that these men and women made. Never, ever forget,” Biden told reporters during the somber ceremony to honor members of the military killed while serving in the U.S. armed services. \nThe brief stop to mark the holiday was the first time the former vice president’s left his Wilmington property since mid-March, when the pandemic forced most Americans to huddle in their homes in order to prevent the spread of the virus. The last public event Biden held outside his home was a March 12 briefing on the coronavirus with reporters at a hotel in Wilmington.\n\"It feels good to be out of my house,\" Biden told reporters.\n\n      Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden and Jill Biden, arrive to lay a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veterans Memorial Park, Monday, May 25, 2020, in New Castle, Del. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n      \n\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE'S NOT 'HIDIN' AS HE DEFENDS VIRTUAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGY\nPushing back against criticism from President Trump and his allies that he’s hiding in the basement of his home in Delaware during the coronavirus crisis, Biden emphasized two weeks ago that he’s “following the guidelines” by campaigning online and argued that he’s “winning” right now in his general election faceoff with the GOP incumbent in the White House.\n“We’re on the campaign trail now. Everybody says ‘Biden’s hidin.’ Let me tell you something, we’re doing very well. We’re following the guidelines of the medical profession. We’re following the guidelines of the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world,” Biden said in an interview on ABC’s \"Good Morning America.\"\nWith most Americans following social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, all large-scale events and gatherings have been scrapped, which has made holding traditional campaign events like rallies and town halls impossible. Political campaigns have improvised, holding their interactions with voters and supporters and their fundraisers virtually.\nAfter mostly staying at the White House for a month and a half, the president has made three coronavirus-related official White House trips to three crucial general election battleground states the past three weeks.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

Ralph Northam faced criticism on social media after appearing in Virginia Beach Saturday without a face mask and not practicing social distancing measures around members of the public.\nNortham reportedly visited the beach with Mayor Bobby Dye on the second day of the beach’s reopening, according to local news outlet 13News Now. Virginia Beach's reopening is considered a test to see if people can safely follow social distancing rules before other beaches in Virginia reopen.\nBut Northam, who previously served as an Army doctor, came under fire when images of him surfaced on social media not wearing a face mask and apparently in close contact with other community members.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reminded the public this week that the coronavirus mainly spreads person-to-person when in close proximity, while it also revealed that surface contamination is far less likely than previously thought.\nAccording to the state-mandated rules, people are allowed to be outside without a mask when sunbathing, swimming and fishing as long as they remain distant from other parties.\nNORTHAM DITCHES CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS FOR VIRGINIA BEACH AFTER WEEKEND SEES CROWDS DEFY HIS ORDERS\nThe governor’s office told NBC in a statement: “The governor has repeatedly encouraged wearing face coverings inside or when social distancing is impossible. He was outside today and not expecting to be within 6 feet of anyone.”\nThe governor is expected to announce new mask protocols on Tuesday, according to an NBC source in the governor’s office.\nAll inside businesses will have new face-covering requirements as the state slowly returns to business as usual.\nVIRGINIA GOVERNOR TO DELAY REOPENING NORTHERN PARTS OF STATE, NEAR DC, FOR TWO WEEKS\nThe state initiated Phase One of its reopening plan on May 15, but northern Virginia was allowed to wait until midnight May 28 to start reopening, to give local businesses more time to meet the new health and safety standards.\nPhase One of the plan still bans social gatherings of 10 people or more, and the recommended social distancing guideline of six feet or more is still in place.\nCLICK HERE FOR

During that period, she claims her fever reached 104.1 degrees Fahrenheit, and she also lost her sense of taste and smell.\nNow, more than 50 days later, she told CTV she still suffers shortness of breath. “COVID-19 has taken a lot out of me, and it continues every day,” she said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAfter producing a positive result seven times, her eighth test came back negative. “I cried because I was so happy,” Schofield said.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes on the rich — just not pay her own.\nThe Democratic socialist congresswoman from The Bronx still hasn’t paid a 7-year-old tax bill leftover from a failed business venture.\nAOC had founded Brook Avenue Press, a publishing house that sought designers, artists and writers from urban areas to help paint The Bronx in a positive way in children’s stories, in 2012.\nAOC SAYS GREEN NEW DEAL 'COSTS US $0 IF PASSED' BECAUSE IT'S JUST A 'NON-BINDING RESOLUTION OF VALUES'\nAs the Post previously reported, public records show the state dissolved the company in October 2016. The state can make such a move when a business fails to pay corporate taxes or file a return.\nThe state Tax Department then filed a warrant against her now-defunct business on July 6, 2017, over a $1,618.36 unpaid bill.\nAs of Friday, the tax warrant had still not been satisfied, and the outstanding balance had grown to $2,088.78, the department said.\n\n      Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., listens to questioning of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, at the House Oversight and Reform Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2019. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n      \n\n\n“She just thinks she’s better than everyone else. Clearly, she’s worse,” said Hank Sheinkopf, spokesman for AOC’s chief June primary-race opponent, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, to The Post.\nBut Ocasio-Cortez’s camp says the rep is challenging the $2,088.78 bill because it was issued “in error.\"\nAOC'S TOP AIDE ADMITS GREEN NEW DEAL ABOUT ECONOMY, NOT CLIMATE\n\n\n“The congresswoman is still in the process of contesting the tax warrant. The business has been closed for several years now, and so we believe that the state Tax Department has continued to collect the franchise tax in error,” said Lauren Hitt, an AOC spokeswoman.\n“As anyone who’s tried to contest a tax bill in error knows, it takes time,” Hitt added.\nAOC, a first-term incumbent, will face Democratic voters in the June 23 primary in the 14th Congressional District covering portions of The Bronx and Queens.\nShe shocked the political world when she toppled Ex-Congressman and former Queens Democratic Party Chairman Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn one of her first moves as a congresswoman in 2019, AOC said taxes on the country’s wealthiest should be increased to as much as 70 percent.\nMeanwhile, the financial statement of Caruso-Cabrera, a former CNBC anchor, has yet to be publicly posted. Her campaign spokesman said it was filed Friday – the May 15 deadline.\n\nCLICK FOR MORE FROM THE NEW YORK POST", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

An independent review found Deras did little to investigate the case even when the victims reported attempts to lure her out of her dorm, the paper said.\nLYFT DRIVER CLEARED IN DISAPPEARANCE OF UNIVERSITY OF UTAH STUDENT, POLICE SAY\n“This latest revelation makes me wonder when we’ll hit bottom,” her father, Matt McCluskey, told the Tribune.\nOne of Deras’ colleagues confirmed to campus police that Deras had shown him an image, the force admitted to the Tribune, which said it also spoke to another officer who had overheard the initial conversations.\nDeras — who later resigned and now works for Logan police, 85 miles away — did not respond to several requests for comment, the paper said.\nWhile confirming the claim, university police insisted it was not reported at the time — and only came to light when the Tribune started making requests for records.\n“He was long gone before we had any inkling that that incident with the photo being shown had occurred,” Lt. Jason Hinojosa told the paper.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \nThe officer who saw the image was not disciplined because he had not asked to see it, Hinojosa said. Data later downloaded from Deras’ phone was either corrupted or from after the McCluskey investigation, the paper said.\nMaj. Scott Stephenson, who oversees all police training in the state under the Utah Department of Public Safety, said it could be grounds for action against Deras’ police certification.\n“It’s very alarming to me,” Stephenson told the Tribune, suggesting it might be a “policy violation” for having not been reported earlier.\n\nCLICK FOR MORE FROM THE NEW YORK POST", "categories": [{"confident":

The capacity of the ships is believed to be around 175,000 metric tons. \n“This is like a new one for everyone,” said Capt. Ranjith Raja, an analyst who tracks oil shipments by sea at the data firm Refinitiv, of the gasoline shipments. “We haven’t seen anything like this before.”\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\nRaja notes the ships all appear to have been loaded from the Persian Gulf Star Refinery near Bandar Abbas, Iran, which makes gasoline. One of the vessels, the Clavel, listed its AIS destination as Caracas beginning May 12, according to log data from ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com. \nThe vessel later changed its destination as \"TO ORDER\" two days later, though the ship remains on route to what appears to be Venezuela as it leaves the Mediterranean Sea.\nGiven the crushing U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran, Venezuela appears to be the country willing to accept the shipments. Raja said Refinitiv had no data on any Iranian gasoline shipment ever going to South America before.\nQuoted by a website affiliated to Iranian state television, cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei on Saturday said he did not have any information on the ships.\nUS RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO EXTEND IRAN ARMS EMBARGO\n“We have to sell our oil and we have access to its paths,” Rabiei said. “Iran and Venezuela are two independent nations that have had trade with each other and they will” in the future.\nIran has warned America that it will retaliate against any actions should America act “like pirates” and attack any of the vessels. \n“If the United States, like pirates, intends to create insecurity on international highways, it will take a dangerous risk that will certainly not go unnoticed,” warned Nour, an Iranian news agency believed to have ties to the country's Supreme National Security Council.\nVENEZUELA CLAIMS IT 'FOILED' ATTACK BACKED BY US, COLOMBIA\nVenezuela suffers a deepening economic crisis, which has driven up crime rates and deepened political divides within the country. Crumbling public services such as running water, electricity and medical care have driven nearly 5 million people to leave.\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has previously turned to Iran for help, but Iran has finally responded after the coronavirus pandemic, an oil crisis and U.S. sanctions have hit the Iranian economy. \nEarlier this month, Iran authorized the replacement of the rial with the toman, which is worth 10,000 rials, in an effort to curb the rampant inflation that has ravaged the country. Iran's currency as lost more than 60 percent of its value while consumer prices rose 37 percent just this year.\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt remains unclear how the U.S. will respond to the tankers. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury, State Department and Coast Guard issued an advisory warning the maritime industry of illegal shipping and sanctions-dodging tactics by countries, including Iran.\nThe

Flynn had been seeking to withdraw his guilty plea to a false-statements charge brought in late 2017 by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nKT McFARLAND: BARR RIGHT TO DROP FLYNN PROSECUTION – THOSE WHO FRAMED FLYNN MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE\nWhile working on the Trump transition team in December 2016, Flynn spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in conversations that were intercepted by our government (because Russian-government operatives, such as Kislyak, are routinely monitored by the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies). Among the topics Flynn and Kislyak discussed was the imposition of sanctions against Russia, which President Obama had just announced.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThat these conversations took place has been known for over three years — ever since a still-unidentified government official leaked that classified information to the Washington Post. For almost as long, it has been known that the FBI became aware of the Flynn–Kislyak discussions very shortly after they happened.\nWhat was not known until last week was that then–acting Attorney General Sally Yates was out of the loop. She found out about the discussions nearly a week afterward — from Obama, of all people.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThis was at a White House pow-wow on Jan. 5, 2017. That was the day when the chiefs of key intelligence agencies briefed top Obama White House officials on their assessment of Russia’s meddling in the campaign.\nAfter the main briefing, the president asked Yates and FBI director James Comey to stick around to meet with him, along with Vice President Biden and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Yates was taken aback when Obama explained that he had “learned of the information about Flynn” and his conversation with Kislyak. She was startled because, she later told investigators, she “had no idea what the president was talking about.”\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\nCLICK HERE TO READ

The deals won’t disappear the moment we’re allowed back on planes.\nWHICH AIRLINES ARE REQUIRING MASKS FOR CREW OR PASSENGERS?\nKeep reading to learn more about airfare trends, along with other ways to prep for a cheap and stress-free vacation in the hopefully-not-too-distant future.\nWill deals disappear when the pandemic ends?\nNo. Airlines understand that after months of social-distancing, it’ll take something pretty special to get people back into the mindset of cramming themselves in planes, so watch for super-deals to be the bait. And don’t worry, these deals will be around for a while.\n\n      Airlines are hoping to make flights more attractive to Americans once the guidelines against non-essential travel are lifted, says Rick Seaney, the CEO of travel analytics company 3Victors.\n      (iStock)\n\n\nShop now, fly later\nNormally, you make darn sure of your travel dates before you book, because change fees are killers (up to $200 per ticket, even more for international flights). Most change fees have since gone out the window, however, because airlines are trying to remove any hurdles that might prevent people from purchasing tickets, to fly now or fly later. And airlines keep tweaking their change fee policies, so they become ever-more generous.\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\nHolidays will be cheaper\nHoliday travel will never be an out-and-out steal, but we are already seeing deals for Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2020 already. It may even get cheaper as we get closer to the end of the year, but here are some current examples of round-trip fares, all of which were found recently via online deal-finding tools.:\nThanksgiving:\nBoston to Washington, D.C., Nov. 24-28, $183\nLos Angles to Seattle, Nov. 24-28, $267\n\nChristmas:\nChicago to Fort Lauderdale, Dec. 20-27, $220\nDallas to Denver, Dec. 22-26, $223\nNew York to London, Dec. 20-27, $476\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nThe old rules to find cheap airfare will still work\nOld rules like \"fly cheaper days.\" For domestic travel, you can usually pay less by flying Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday; outside the U.S., weekdays are generally cheaper than weekends. The following airfare examples (found April 28) are the cheapest flights from Los Angeles to New York in early November:\nFly Tuesday-Saturday, $139\nFly Friday-Sunday, $257\n\nDon’t worry about expired ID at security checkpoints\nAccording to the folks who oversee airport security, if your driver's license expired on or after March 1 of this year, and you can’t renew because the DMV is closed, you can still use the old license as acceptable identification at any TSA checkpoint, for up to a year after expiration. \n\n \nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' CONTINUING CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\nOne more thing: Remember how we were all supposed to have the new \"Real ID\" licenses in order to fly starting in October of this year?

Everybody else is locked at home, as they have been for more than a month, but not former President Obama. For him, golfing at his country club was an essential activity.\"\nCarlson noted that a few days after Obama was photographed on the golf course, District of Columbia residents received an automated phone message from Michelle Obama \"urg[ing them] to stay home except if you need essential health care, food or supplies -- or go to an essential job.\"\n\"It didn't seem to occur to her that those standards might also apply to her family and that's why she didn't mention essential trips to your country club,\" Carlson said.\nCarlson then turned to the state of Maine, whose Democratic governor, Janet Mills, extended the state's stay-at-home order through the end of May, with hotels and bars prohibted from reopening until July 1 at the earliest.\n\"She told every church to keep its doors locked, ensuring that many of them will go defunct and disappear forever,\" Carlson said of Mills, adding that at \"the very moment [Mills] spoke, a grand total of 33 people were being treated in Maine hospitals for the coronavirus, 33 people out of a population of more than 1.3 million people. Over the full course of this entire epidemic, just 51 people in the state of Maine have died from the coronavirus.\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\"You may be wondering where exactly does Janet Mills derive the power to invent a new normal for 1.3 million people, to remake human society in whatever form she chooses?\" Carlson continued. \"Mills did not explain that.\"\n\"People in power abuse their power -- that may be the lesson here,\" he concluded. \"The arrival of a terrifying new virus from China gave our leaders more power than anyone has had in the history of this country. Six weeks ago, America was something resembling an imperfect democracy ...

Back then I was a field artillery lieutenant,\" Walker told Fox News. \"With the COVID deaths today... These are all not just Americans, but these ... are innocent people.\"\nLAUREN GREEN: CORONAVIRUS CRISIS -- WHY SOME CHURCHES ARE DEFYING BANS ON GATHERING\nWalker is one of several chaplains at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan's Upper East Side. He is on the front lines of this pandemic, providing spiritual and emotional support to patients and hospital staff in the city that never sleeps, which is the epicenter of America's outbreak.\nAll the chaplains help people of all different faiths, even those without any stated religion.\nCARDINAL DOLAN SAYS HE ADMIRES TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP ON HELPING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY RECOVER FROM CORONAVIRUS\n\"My job is to try to figure that out ... read between the lines and then meet them where they are,\" he said. \"All chaplains are trained to walk right alongside them where their faith is.\"\nWhile most COVID-19 patients will recover – Mount Sinai has discharged at least 2,000 – many do not. And those are the ones Walker looks after, as he is the chaplain overseeing the intensive care unit. He sees the most severe cases of the disease, sometimes providing a FaceTime chat for families and loved ones.\nHe can't go into a patient's room, but through the glass doors can give families a view of their loved one.\n\"I'll walk right up to the door and I'll let them see their family members, which is oftentimes very hard to see someone they love hooked up to so many different machines,\" he said, adding that he uses his own phone of FaceTime calls. \"And at that time, it's very personal between them and the family. Sometimes I pray with them. Sometimes I just let them look in.\"\nPETER ROSENBERGER: CORONAVIRUS — AS A CAREGIVER FOR 30 YEARS, I KNOW HEALING POWER OF THIS ONE THING\nWitnessing dozens of deaths has been difficult and painful for the staff. The hardest cases are when the end comes too quickly.\n\"There's been more than one for me that the patient dies before we could bring the family in,\" Walker said, choking back tears. \"And that's hard.\"\nAs the virus continues to claim victims, his task is to help medical staff deal with the mounting battle fatigue. The chaplain staff has provided a small safe room for them where they can cry, scream, or just sit and ponder the existential reality.\nWalker sees his job as a humbling spiritual responsibility.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \nHe offers these heartfelt words in prayer:\n\"God you trust me to be with this person, right as they're coming to meet you,\" he said. \"It's such

Ted Cruz on issues surrounding China's actions before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\n\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced Friday that he intends to introduce legislation that would prevent outlets -- like China's Phoenix TV -- from using Canadian or Mexican stations to spread foreign propaganda across U.S. airwaves.\nThe move comes as the U.S. has criticized the Chinese government for its role in spreading disinformation about the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in a lab in Wuhan. Cruz's office specifically mentioned Phoenix TV, which is reportedly using a Mexican broadcast tower to transmit Chinese propaganda into the U.S.\nAccording to a press release, this particular legislation would amend communications law in a way that would preclude the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from granting licenses to \"broadcast applicants who intend to change the language of the station they are purchasing, unless the FCC can certify that the programming of the station will never be influenced by a foreign government or governing party.\"\n\"China should not be able to set up shop in Mexico and blanket America with propaganda,\" Cruz said in the press release.\nCNN'S HARWOOD CALLS TRUMP 'AUTHORITARIAN' FOR QUESTIONING MEDIA OUTLET TIED TO CHINA'S GOVERNMENT\n\"Every year, the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] spends billions of dollars purchasing news outlets and waging information warfare to extend the reach of its propaganda and whitewash the unflattering and politically inconvenient truths about its totalitarian regime.\"\nHe added: \"We are seeing this play out right now as news outlets across the country parrot Chinese talking points about the coronavirus pandemic -- a pandemic that could have prevented. I look forward to introducing this legislation when Congress returns and closing FCC loopholes that allow China to wage their information warfare from across the border in Mexico.\"\nPhoenix TV previously caught attention when Trump questioned one of its reporters at a press briefing earlier in April on the coronavirus.\n\"Sounds like a statement more than a question,\" Trump said at the time. The reporter went on to cite a Chinese ambassador's op-ed calling for cooperation with the United States. \"Are you personally working directly with China?\" she asked.\nTED CRUZ PRAISES BILL MAHER FOR 'RANT' ABOUT CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATING IN CHINA\nAfter Trump cited his trade agreement with China, the reporter again asked whether he was cooperating with China. \"Who are you working for? China?\" Trump responded.\nPhoenix TV is partially owned by a company backed by China's government, and U.S. intelligence has reportedly identified the station as a propaganda outlet.\nCLICK HERE TO GET COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\nIn 2005, The Washington Post reported that Phoenix TV CEO Liu Changle served in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and worked as a \"military journalist\" for Central People's Radio, a state-owned outlet that was later renamed \"China National Radio.\" The Hoover Institution at Stanford University previously labeled Phoenix TV as \"quasi-official\" state media, adding it was \"completely controlled by [the] Chinese government.\"\nCruz previously expressed concern about this issue in 2018 when the FCC was reviewing an application from a company -- HH Group -- tied to the Chinese government and Phoenix TV.\n\"I am concerned that approving this application would enhance the ability of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] to broadcast objectionable political propaganda into America and to interfere in American domestic politics,\" Cruz said at the time.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

On the brink of bipartisan passage of COVID-19 relief, filibustering Senate Democrats stalled the $2.2 trillion CARES Act for five business days last month. Pelosi abused this national emergency to demand taxpayer dollars for the musician-hating Kennedy Center, subsidies for windmills and solar panels, an ingenious ruse to fund

He added that the WHO had ignored \"credible information\" in December 2019 that the virus could be transmitted from human to human.\nAs early as late December, Wuhan medical staff were suspected to have contracted the disease, indicating likely human-to-human transmissibility.\nOn January 4, in a statement first flagged by The National Review, the head University of Hong Kong’s Centre for Infection warned that “the city should implement the strictest possible monitoring system for a mystery new viral pneumonia that has infected dozens of people on the mainland, as it is highly possible that the illness is spreading from human to human.\"\nThe Chinese government also began suppressing news about the virus. Nevertheless, on January 8, the WHO declared: “Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\"\nAgain on January 14, the WHO simply echoed Chinese government statements:  “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.”\n\n      President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House, Tuesday, April 14, 2020, in Washington.

Make up a game. Use your imagination!” my parents said.\nAnd so we went outside. We made up games and played with our friends. We actually talked to each other (and fought with each other!).\n\n      Author Dana Perino with her younger sister.\n      (Courtesy of the author)\n\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: CORONAVIRUS -- GET READY FOR LIFE AFTER COVID-19. HERE'S WHAT TO DO TODAY\n\n\nAs a busy adult, I’ve long wanted a moment of boredom. Boredom is a luxury!\nThe best part about boredom is that it can lead to wonderfully creative ideas. \n\n\nKids today have no idea what it was like to be bored — back then literally nothing was on television, no Internet, no Spotify.\nThe video games we had in the 1980s were visually uninteresting (though I spent hours playing “Frogger” and “Donkey Kong”).\nScreen time was unheard of -- and now it is something kids and parents argue about every day. And as a result these days, kids struggle to imagine and create their own entertainment.\nThen came social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. There was only so much looking at our phones that our brains could take. And we ran out of shows to binge upon. \n\n\nWe started to crave other ways to spend all this time at home we are having now.\nWe want to keep communicating, encouraging, laughing and, most importantly, connecting. \n\n\nAnd that has led to some wonderfully creative family projects.\nFor instance, I’ve loved the family dance videos, such as this one from New Zealand and the coronavirus take on \"Les Miserables\" by this British family. \n\n\nOne of my favorites of these family endeavors was a video made by Ian Prior and his family.

Hardly. In fact, profit margins are so thin, one storm could blow them over permanently.\nEspecially restaurants, which are getting hit hard these days. By the time this is over, a night out will be heading to 7-Eleven to buy beans.\nTOM BASILE: WHO-CHINA CORONAVIRUS FAILURES — TIME FOR US TO DO THIS AT THE UNITED NATIONS\nWe worry about waitresses, servers, and of course, every tavern's ICU specialist, the bartender. But to help them, you've got to help the owners first.\nIt’s like in airline emergencies, where the parent has to put on the oxygen mask before he or she helps the kids.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThe guy who owns the bar needs help first so then he can then pay his staff. If not you end up with boarded-up storefronts. A bustling street becomes skid row. Towns die this way.\nThe solution? Glad you asked. I once balanced my checkbook.\nSo, President Trump, if you're listening – I know you are – first government needs to make loans directly to business owners. Cut out hiring requirements. If the owner can’t pay it back, it’s on him or her.\nThey did this after 9/11. It worked.\nThe loans should also have a long payback period to reduce thoughts of suicide, because that’s where debt can lead. Sixteen percent of all suicides are financially driven.\nThe second part involves you, the viewer. You need to go out and spend. Get that oxygen pumping into the system.\nBut first, you need an incentive. So how about for one year, we make meals and beverages tax-deductible? Take those bar tabs and mark them all \"self-entertainment.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSo if your family goes out and spends $200, you get $60 back later. Let’s put the “fun” in “refund.”\nBecause if we don’t, you could lose your favorite bar. Which sucks, because after all this, you’re going to need a drink.\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld's monologue on \"The Five\" on April 8, 2020.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREG GUTFELD", "categories":
