The correct position is spelt out in my tweet of 2nd April 2020,\" Puri tweeted on Sunday.\n\nOn April 2, he had tweeted: \"The current lockdown on both domestic and international passenger flights is till April 15. A decision to restart the flights after this period remains to be taken. If required, we will have to assess the situation on a case by case basis.\" \n\n\n\nAsked at a press conference on April 2 about resumption of international flights, Puri had said: \"Air India had first cancelled the flights to China, then the other carriers stopped flying. \" \n\n\n\n\"So far as the lockdown is concerned, the lockdown is till April 15. And, we can start considering the resumption of flights on a case-by-case basis depending on where they are coming from after that,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about resumption of passenger flight services, Civil Aviation Secretary P S Kharola's statement at the briefing indicated that the government direction is very clear that the lockdown is up to April 14.\n\n\"As far as post that (April 14) is concerned, it is all up to airlines. Airlines have to judge the situation and they can take the bookings,\" he had said on April 2.\n\n\"In case the lockdown gets extended, then the same process (of cancellation) has to be followed, and if the lockdown is not extended, then the bookings will be honoured,\" said the secretary.\n\nLike many other countries, civil aviation sector has been hit hard in India too following restrictions of flight operations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Sunday, Air Deccan became the latest casualty of the crisis as it announced indefinite suspension of flight operations and asked all employees to go on sabbatical without pay.\n\nAs revenues have fallen significantly due to the coronavirus crisis, IndiGo has announced a pay cut of up to 25 per cent for its senior employees.\n\nAnother airline, Vistara, too has announced a compulsory leave without pay of up to three days for its senior employees.\n\nSpiceJet has stated that its employees' salaries would be reduced between 10 to 30 per cent while the Air India has announced a 10 per cent cut in allowances for every employee, except cabin crew, for the coming three months.\n\nGoAir has cut salaries of its employees, laid off its expat pilots and introduced leave without pay for employees on a rotational basis.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

This may include going easy on the insistence for additional collateral as a pre-condition by\n\nThe NPA delinquency relaxation to 180 days “may be heavily qualified to prevent its abuse”, said a source. The staggered NPA relaxation glide path can be expected to have ‘start-stop dates’, which will finally settle down to the current 90-day timeline by the close of 2020-21.\n\nThe interest accrued, but not received after January 1, 2020, may be allowed to be repaid in six monthly instalments from October 1 to end-March 2021. This ties in with the possibility of the delinquency period for classification of being extended to 180 days.\n\nA key concern is that the three-month moratorium on term loans by the central bank, and its linkage to the account being ‘regular’ to avail of the same, may lead to a situation wherein weaker borrowers come under even more stress.\n\n“These borrowers may default and get downgraded as under the current norms due to their inability to service the interest component on which there is no breather,” said a source.\n\n“This is especially since sales in the June 2020 quarter will be extremely poor. Their ability to get fresh financing will also be under a cloud,” he added.\n\nThe amount that can avail of by way of refinance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, National Housing Bank, and the Small Industries Development Bank of India is also to be looked at. A reference may be made to International Accounting Standard 10 pertaining to ‘events after the reporting period’. Its applicability to the Indian context is said to have been examined. Receipts, payments, recoveries, or provisions made or received up to September 30, 2020, could be considered while finalising the accounts for 2019-20 (FY20). Or an additional six months will be captured in banks’ accounts for FY20. It has been gathered that ‘talks with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) have been initiated on this aspect’.\n\nThe additional provisioning norm under the central bank’s June 7 circular and incorporation of a three-month breather in its key trigger points may also be warranted. The additional provisioning have to comply with under the June 7 circular is as follows — 20 per cent after 180 days from end of the review period; and 15 per cent after a year; or a total additional provisioning of 35 per cent.\n\nIt was given to understand that the central bank’s insistence that the three-month moratorium ‘shall be contingent on lending institutions satisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from Covid-19’, has been flagged off to both its senior decision-making levels and to North Block. Borrowers, especially micro, small and medium enterprises, service the interest just in time before the 90-day NPA norm kicks in. It was suggested to the RBI that it could have said the account should have been ‘standard’ — that is, it is not an NPA or a special mention account — rather than insist it should be ‘regular’.",

It condescendingly told The Netherlands to 'double-check the instructions' on its masks, for example, after The Netherlands complained that half of the masks they were sent did not meet safety standards, the media reported.\n\n\"It's so disingenuous for Chinese officials now to say we are the ones who are helping the Italians or we are the ones who are helping the developing when, in fact, they are the ones who infected all of us,\" the senior administration official said.\n\n\"Of course they should be helping. They have a special responsibility to help because they are the ones who began the spread of the coronavirus and did not give the information required to the rest of the to plan accordingly,\" he added.\n\nThe official also said that China's 'disinformation campaign' of lying to the world about the seriousness of its COVID-19 outbreak has further delayed the response by countries.\n\nAs China downplayed the outbreak within its borders, nearly half a million people traveled to the US potentially carrying the virus, the official said.\n\nAs the lethal virus paves its way through continents and various territories across the globe, killing people in millions and crippling economies, China has still been underreporting about the accurate figures in the mainland. The country has also claimed no new deaths from the virus, even as thousands of ash urns are shipped to local hospitals.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-19", "level": 2, "links":

It sends preachers to countries to spread Islam's ideals.\n\nAccording to organisers, a number of foreign nationals also attended this year's gathering from countries including China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Afghanistan.\n\nAbout 1,500 foreigners are now quarantined in Pakistan, but others left the country without being tested.\n\nOn March 23, Gaza's health ministry confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus were Palestinians who had attended the gathering.\n\nPakistan's Science Minister Fawad Chaudhry expressed exasperation the Jamaat took place, and blamed \"the stubbornness of the clergy.\" \"Any group of people who will not adhere to the government advice and will continue to do their normal activities will become a danger to others,\" he told AFP.\n\nSpeaking to AFP, senior Tablighi preacher Naeem Butt said it was \"ignorant\" and \"irresponsible\" to blame the movement for spreading the virus.\n\n\"We cancelled our event after two days when the authorities told us to do so,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, organisers blamed rainy weather, not the virus, for ending the event.\n\nCoronavirus has killed at least 41 people in Pakistan, though with only limited testing available, observers worry the number is far higher.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB23-7", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Budget carrier AirAsia India on Saturday said bookings for its flights will be open from April 15, but it is open to any change in case aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issues fresh directives on the issue.\n\n\n\nWhile most airlines have commenced taking bookings for their flights from April 15, state-owned Air India said on Friday it has stopped bookings till April 30 and is awaiting a decision after April 14. Thackeray said during a webcast on Saturday that lifting of the lockdown post April 14 will depend on the compliance by people. On Saturday morning, PTI reported that railways is preparing to resume all its services from April 15. It quoted sources who said all railway safety personnel, running staff, guards, TTE and other officials have been told to be ready to join from April 15.\n\n\n\nIt said the railways has issued a “restoration plan” to all its zones with a schedule of trains to be run, their frequency and the availability of rakes. All 17 zones have been sent a missive to be prepared to run their respective services, the source said. Hours later, the railways clarified that no final decision has been taken yet on restoration of train services. “Train services will resume only on specific approval of each train from the Railway Board. Suggestions for phase-wise planning should be given to the board,” an official said. This decision was taken after a video conference of railway minister Piyush Goyal with chairman of Railway Board on Friday, said officials.\n\n\n\nTrains, however, will begin operations only after receiving a green light from the government.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-3",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1149264, "name": "Ap"}, "body": "There are the new dead. And then there are the bodies waiting in overcrowded mortuaries to be buried as cities struggle to meet demand and families wrestle with rules on social distancing that make the usual funeral rituals impossible.\n\nMed Alliance Group, a medical distributor in Illinois, is besieged by calls and emails from cities around the country. Each asks the same thing: Send more refrigerated trailers so that we can handle a situation we never could have imagined.\n\nThey're coming from all over: From hospitals, health systems, coroner's offices, VA facilities, county and state health departments, state emergency departments and funeral homes, said Christie Penzol, a spokeswoman for Med Alliance. It's heart-wrenching. The company has rented all its trailers and there's an 18-week wait for new materials to build more, she said.\n\nWith U.S. medical experts and even President Donald Trump now estimating the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic could reach 240,000 nationwide, the sheer practicalities of death where to put the bodies are worrying just about everyone as cities, hospitals and private medical groups clamor to secure additional storage.\n\nThe need is compounded by private mortuary space that is occupied longer than usual as people wait to bury their loved ones regardless of how they died because rules on social distancing make planning funerals difficult. It's a crisis being repeated worldwide.\n\nIn Spain, where the death toll has climbed to nearly 12,000, an ice rink in Madrid was turned into a makeshift morgue after the city's municipal funeral service said it could no longer take coronavirus bodies until it was restocked with protective equipment. In Italy, embalmed bodies in caskets are being sent to church halls and warehouses while they await cremation or burial.\n\nAnd in the coastal Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, macabre images and pleas from families on social media show dead loved ones wrapped in plastic or cloth, waiting for days to be taken away by overwhelmed morgue workers.\n\nIn the U.S. epicenter of New York City, where the death toll was nearly 1,900 on Saturday, authorities brought in refrigerated trucks to store bodies. At Brooklyn Hospital Center, a worker wheeled out a body covered in white plastic on a gurney and a forklift operator carefully raised it into a refrigerated trailer.\n\nCities and states that haven't been hard-hit yet are trying to prepare for the worst.\n\nIt's hard to say exactly how much morgue space is available nationwide. Many cities and counties submit emergency preparedness plans for review by state and federal officials, but tallies aren't always complete and private mortuaries aren't always included. Trade groups like the National Association of Medical Examiners don't track those capacities either.\n\nBut, in general, few morgues in the country can hold even 200 to 300 bodies. In Washington, D.C., which has a morgue that can hold about 270 bodies, officials said they would seek help from federal partners if needed. Dallas has a plan for refrigerated space as part of its emergency preparedness efforts. And Chicago is already using a trailer outside the medical examiner's office for the bodies of coronavirus victims, and may use a refrigerated warehouse if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked the Defense Department for 100,000 body bags, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Michael Andrews said Thursday.\n\nOn a daily basis, the system works at essentially full capacity in most jurisdictions, said Robert A. Jensen, co-owner of Kenyon International Emergency Services, a private disaster response company based in Texas.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2426696, "name": "Jack Wittels"}, "body": "The world over, one mainstream fuel -- -- has managed to remain a decent profit center for the oil refining industry at large as the novel ravages economies and their wider demand for petroleum products.\n\nhas risen in value relative to crude in recent weeks due to a combination of continued industrial usage and purchasing of a near-identical fuel for stockpiling as a heating oil in Europe. In addition, there have been curbs in refining to minimize a glut of products like gasoline and jet fuel.\n\nBut diesel’s star is starting to fade, with its premium to crude oil recently dropping in trading hubs around the world. As refiners try to maximize output of the fuel and with only a finite amount of land-based storage, it may be just a matter of time before the market starts to collapse.\n\n“It feels like we’re running almost at full tilt into a brick wall,” said Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy.\n\nDiesel’s premium to crude in northwest Europe dropped to under $10 a barrel on Friday, after settling at a little over $17 -- the highest since October -- on March 30. The premium, or so-called crack spread, has also dropped dramatically in Singapore and on the U.S. Gulf Coast in recent days.\n\nUntil now, has been somewhat shielded from the troubles plaguing jet fuel and gasoline, which have tumbled in value as airlines ground flights and governments impose restrictions on people’s movement. Because of the collapse of those markets, refiners have been focusing on diesel production instead, building up a potential problem for the future.\n\nThe extent of the possible oversupply is unclear. Diesel margins in Europe are likely to be hit first, Sawyer said, adding that the continent’s relatively high number of diesel-powered passenger vehicles makes the fuel there potentially vulnerable to coronavirus-related lockdowns that sap demand. Tankers hauling millions of barrels of unwanted product from Asia and Russia will further add to supplies.\n\n \n\n\n\nAmerica is also seeing waning demand. Pilot Company, the country’s biggest truck stop company, said diesel sales across its business were strong several weeks ago, when the World Health Organization declared the a pandemic. Since then, diesel sales have dipped, this week down about 10-15% as industrial plants, other businesses and cities shut, according to Pilot Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Haslam.\n\nRefineries across the globe have been curbing production as the outbreak spreads. If supply drops enough, then the risk of a diesel glut will subside.\n\nOne factor to watch will be the amount of fuel that moves into storage. In Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region, diesel and gasoil supplies in independent storage are near their lowest seasonal levels in six years, data from Insights Global show. Distillate inventories in the U.S. have also declined, according to government data.\n\n“We don’t actually expect to see that much diesel end up in stock in the coming weeks,” said Eugene Lindell, senior consultant at JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna. “This is because it is the only product that is short, and therefore the only product that keeps refineries running. So if demand falls more, supply will have to fall more as well.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB2-9", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

It just took two days to add 200,000 Covid-19 cases across the globe.\n\nThe number of days taken to add 200,000 fresh cases to the global infected cases tally as well as the time taken to add 10,000 Covid-19 casualties is rapidly shortening. It took 122 days to reach the 200,000 mark since the first Covid-19 positive case was registered on 17th November in China and 67 days to cross 10,000 fatalities. At present, it takes just two days to attain the same number of fresh cases or deaths. \n\n\n\n#2. France added the most number of fatalities in a day\n\nJust ten days ago, Italy’s share in the total death toll of Covid-19 was the highest in the world. Italy’s share then was 29% but has since shrunk to 13%. The share in the death toll of the new epicentre of the pandemic, the United States, currently stands at 16% along with Spain. On 2nd April, France alone accounted for over 20% of global fatalities.\n\nMajor reduction in the share in the number of deaths was witnessed in Italy and Spain which were earlier accounting for almost half of the overall Covid-19 deaths between 25th-30th March. Apart from these four nations, the rest of the world has one-third share in the overall daily death due to \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n South Korea saw a major spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the first week of March. At that time, the country was going through its deadliest phase – the death rate was at its peak, and the recovery rate was at its lowest and the country was adding more than 500 cases daily, on an average.\n\nSouth Korea has since made significant strides in controlling the pandemic, with both metrics improving considerably in just one month. Experts have attributed this to aggressive testing and contact tracing by the government. The number of cases being recovered daily are more than the number of new case additions.\n\nAmong the closed Covid-19 cases in the country, the outcome ratio between recoveries and deaths was almost equal during early days in March. However, South Korea made a massive comeback with the death rate reducing to less than 3% as the recoveries have risen substantially in the country.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20",

However, India’s six diplomatic missions across the US are in touch with affected citizens and preparing a tentative list of possible evacuees once and if evacuations do start,” said a senior official in the Ministry of External Affairs.\n\nThe ministry’s stance is based on the argument that “Indians currently abroad on employment visas like H-1B work in multinational firms, draw significant wages, and in many cases have retrenchment benefits”. People in the know said no meetings were scheduled with the US State Department regarding the matter.\n\nOn the other hand, those stuck in the US also face no official legal guidance as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has temporarily suspended routine in-person services since March 18. The USCIS plans to re-open offices on April 7.\n\nThe IT sector, a big beneficiary of H-1B visas, has been trying to sort out the issue with US authorities for some time now.\n\n \n\n\n\n“In the US, we have requested the Departments of Homeland Service, Labor and U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services for a 90-day grace period for professionals to depart the US following expiry of their H-1B/ L-1 visas. Additionally, we have sought ease of Labor Condition Application (LCA) norms to allow for ‘work from home’,” said Shivendra Singh, vice-president and head (global trade development) of Nasscom. The UK has announced visa extensions until May 31 for all foreign nationals, while France has also extended visas for three months.\n\n“Many IT professionals in the US are at the risk of being laid off because their employers have lost end-client contracts. Such individuals can remain in the US for up to 60 days, during which they can look for a new job with an employer who can file a new H-1B petition for them. If there is no job in sight, the worker should leave to avoid running the risk of accruing unlawful presence,” said Poorvi Chothani, managing partner of LawQuest.\n\nNasscom’s Singh said people leading the MEA’s COVID-19 efforts have confirmed they have advised Indian Ambassadors to take this up with foreign governments.\n\nThere have been reports of thousands of Indians under similar visa regimes being stuck in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, South Africa, and the UAE, among other areas.\n\nAt present, there is no standard operating procedure in place for airlifting stranded citizens from corona-hit nations, with the External Affairs ministry identifying particularly hit areas such as Iran, China, and South Korea.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB4-11",

This is forcing oil & gas operations to an unviable status,” the letter said.\n\n\n\nThe association demanded that benefits arising to contractors from reduction in rates should be exempted from corporate income tax. The operator group also indicated that gas prices are much lower than per barrel operating expenditure resulting in negative return.\n\n \n\n\n\n“We have asked the government to reduce its various shares. In addition to this, other policy changes and timeline reconsiderations, too, along with more marketing and pricing freedom,” said Ashu Sagar, secretary general, AOGO. On Thursday, the price of Brent crude was seen at $27.12 a barrel.\n\nThe dip in international prices is positive for India as the country’s import dependency in 2019-20 was around 85.1 per cent, up from 83.8 in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nOwing to lower prices, the import bill, too, dropped from $111.9 billion in 2018-19 to around $95 billion till February in 2019-20.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has curtailed all activities and downsized the global energy demand, resulting in excess supply and low prices. However, this lower price regime is denting the profits of domestic producers. Based on industry estimates, domestic producers save the country more than Rs 1.7 trillion per annum with their production and consequent reduced imports.\n\n\n\nAOGO, in its letter, added that production-sharing contracts that are due for renewal between March and September 2020 should be extended till March 2021 on same terms, and extension can be made effective from April 2021 under the PSC extension policy.\n\n\n\nOther demands include allowing exploration cost recovery from existing revenues and removal of ceiling on gas price for difficult fields. The current ceiling price on domestic natural gas is $5.61 mBtu on gross calorific value basis. The AOGO letter also asked the government to provide tax benefit for exploration and development activities by levying zero goods and services tax.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":

However, it is likely to washout three to six months of revenue and profits in domestic market while hitting hard companies dependent on or with exposure to countries in Europe, US, Middle East and China with uncertainty in the near future posing higher risk,” it said.\n\nThe sector is likely to see a strain on orders, execution as well as face challenges on working capital, cash flows, balance sheet and profits for the financial year ending March 2021 (FY21), it added.\n\nPrivate sector capital goods major Larsen and Toubro has been beaten down to price/book (PB) valuations last seen in the global financial crisis (GFC), noted foreign brokerage firm Jefferies India equity analysts Lavina Quadros and Apoorva Bahadur in their 30th March company update report. The report noted some disruption in the June quarter (1QFY21E).\n\n“L&T is trading at 1-year forward PB valuations below GFC levels and its order book probably reflects one of the lowest private sector and new capex projects’ contribution since it demerged the cement business in 2003...Our earnings reflect 20-25 days work disruption in 1QFY21E,” it said.\n\nGross domestic product, a measure of economic activity, had seen domestic and global headwinds such as weak credit growth and global supply chain disruptions even before the Covid-19 issue came to the fore.\n\nCompleted projects were down from Rs 2.65 trillion in March 2019 to Rs 0.76 trillion in March 2020. Stalled projects declined from Rs 2.68 trillion to Rs 0.48 trillion in the same period.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 992934, "name": "Amritha Pillay"}, "body": "Tata Power has decided to restart its Mundra ultra mega power project (UMPP) units to supply low-cost electricity. This comes at a time when there's rising demand for electricity from its five dedicated power-consuming states. The company had in March briefly shut three of its Mundra units over lack of revised tariff.\n\nThe private power producer will restart these units for the same reason it had shut them - lower tariffs.\n\n“Considering India's present condition when the country is hugely impacted by Covid-19, it is time for us to contribute to the might of the country in this nation-building exercise by supporting and running power plants like Mundra UMPP, which can provide low-cost power to consumers in these states,” Tata Power said in response to Business Standard on Tuesday.\n\nThe company said \"in deference to the demands of the states and the extraordinary condition\", it has decided to restart the Mundra UMPP units.\n\nAccording to a weekly (March 16-22) MIS report for western regional load dispatch centre, three of Mundra’s five units were under generation outage starting March 21. The reason stated for the outage was non-signing of the supplemental power purchase agreements (PPAs).\n\nTata Power supplies power to five states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana — from the 4,000-megawatt plant.\n\nBeginning March this year, Tata Power sent a shutdown notice to these states over delay in adopting the high powered committee recommendations and entering into supplemental PPAs for higher tariff.\n\nOn March 11, Tata Power said it has agreed to continue to supply power to the states up to March 20, giving them time to arrive at a decision on the tariff.\n\nA senior executive from a distribution company (discom) said last week, “We have formed a new resolution plan and need to take it to Cabinet for approval. Other states will also need to do the same.\"\n\nThe executive did not disclose details of the new resolution. Last week, he said, “In the interim, Tata Power has decided to stop supplying power to us and pay a fine instead.”\n\nTata Power’s decision to restart Mundra units will now reverse this.\n\nTata Power welcomes MERC order on tariff cut for next 5 years Tata Power on Tuesday said it was happy that its consumers in Mumbai would continue to get reliable and uninterrupted power at the most competitive tariffs for the next five years. “We appreciate the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) for timely release of order despite the adverse situation the country is facing due to Covid-19. The new tariff order would boost industrial development due to proposed reduction in commercial and industrial tariff,” the company said in its statement. The Maharashtra government on Monday announced an average 8 per cent electricity tariff cut for the next five years to help businesses and people tide over the Covid-19 crisis. For consumers served by private sector discoms Adani Energy and Tata Power in the financial capital, industrial units will have their power rates slashed 18-20 per cent, commercial establishments 19-20 per cent, and residential ones 10-11 per cent, it said. Executives at Adani Electricity did not comment on the order.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

I think my debut was the last time I recall I've done this. Like it or not??\" Warner said in an Instagram post with a video of the dashing left-hander trimming his hair in time-lapse mode.\n\nDue to the pandemic, Australia's death toll stands at 19, as per the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nEarlier, Australia Test skipper Tim Paine had said that the team's upcoming tour to Bangladesh slated to be held in June is unlikely, conceding that one doesnt need to be an \"Einstein\" for that amid the global crisis due to pandemic.\n\n \n\n\n\nAustralia are slated to play a two-Test series against Bangladesh beginning June 11 in Chattogram, followed by the second match starting June 19 in Dhaka. The series is part of the ICC World Test Championship and 120 points will be at stake for both the teams.\n\n\"You don't have to be Einstein to realise (the Bangladesh tour) is probably unlikely to go ahead, particularly in June. Whether it's cancelled or pushed back, we're not quite sure at the moment,\" Paine was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) currently has the WTC final marked down for June 2021, and Paine has suggested there could be scope to rearrange cancelled Test series before then.\n\n\"I hope they don't push it back too far for my sake, that's for sure,\" said Paine.\n\nIf Australia manage a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh when the series does take place, it would see the second-placed Aussies (currently on 296 points on the WTC standings) take all 120 points on offer, meaning they would overtake India (360 points) ahead of the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia at the end of the year.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-9", "level":

However, the 29-year-old is not stressing about it at the moment.\n\n\"I am sure at some point in the coming weeks there will be a discussion but those discussions will probably take place between the PCA and the ECB. Until that happens, that is not my area of expertise,\" ICC’s official website quoted Root.\n\n\"We just have to concentrate on being as fit as we can be for when we get back playing cricket and making sure we are doing everything we can to look after the community,\" he added.\n\nThe cornavirus outbreak, which has infected over 7,00,000 people and caused more that 37,000 deaths worldwide, has forced the global sporting events to come to a standstill.\n\nEngland's tour of Sri Lanka was cancelled earlier this month. Their home Test series against the West Indies and Pakistan and the limited-overs engagement with Australia from June to August are also at risk of being postponed or cancelled depending on the situation.\n\nHere's what Root said about the workload \n\n \n\n But when normal cricket does resume, Root is bracing himself for an exponential increase in the workload.\n\n\"It would be a very tough winter, a huge amount of workload, especially on the multi-format players, but we have had some tough winters in the past and found ways to get through them.\"\n\n \n\n \"It would be interesting to see how they would fit it in looking at the schedule as it right now but if it was to go ahead, we would have to be able to adapt, look at the squad sizes we take over and make sure guys weren't blown out and overworked.\n\nWith uncertainty looming, the skipper has kept an open mind regarding the scheduling.\n\n\"If we are lucky enough to be in a position where we can play then we should try but whether Tests overpower other formats is going to be difficult to know. We have to be very open minded.\"\n\n \n\n\n\nGovernments all across the world are calling for imposition of lockdowns and Root, like several other athletes, is also confined to his house.\n\nThe right-hand batsman, who has turned to home workouts, feels nothing can compare to training together as a group.\n\n\"You can never really replicate the dressing-room environment and building something as a group of players.\"\n\n \n\n \"You spend a long time working towards something collectively and that's something you can take for granted, especially when you play as much as we do.\n\n\"It has become more evident the longer we spend time apart and, as this goes on, I can see that this is what sticks out,\" Root added.\n\n\"Very strange times we are living in. I think it's important that when we get our opportunities we try to help and support everyone around us and really come together like we've seen a lot of throughout the whole nation over the last couple of weeks.\"\n\n \n\n While there may not be any cricket, Root's responsibilities as Test captain are still continuing as he checks on the health and well-being of his squad.\n\n\"I've actually been in touch with every single player across the course of the winter throughout the last couple of weeks to make sure everyone is OK, make sure everyone is getting their stuff done,\" he said.",

Booking during this quarter has largely been on track as a significant part of closures happened in January,” HCL said.\n\nHCL says its business model is a mix of recurring product revenues, managed services and discretionary spending-led professional services. “From a vertical perspective, our exposure to verticals like oil and gas, travel and hospitality, and high-end retail is in single digits,” the company said.\n\n \n\n\n\nALSO READ: Coronavirus LIVE: Lockdown an extraordinary, unprecedented measure, says PM\n\nAviation, travel and tourism, and hospitality have been among the hardest-hit business verticals, since most countries have completely stopped air travel and people have been asked to stay at home as much as possible. As a result, the hotels and hospitality sector has suffered — a big name like Marriott International says it has been hit worse than the September 2001 (9/11) and Great Depression events combined.\n\nOil and gas as a sector has also suffered. “The outbreak has contributed to a dampened demand for oil, resulting in plummeting prices and production declines, especially in the wake of the Russia-Opec (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) price war. As we move forward, then, the energy sector expects to face two headwinds: managing the issues of the health emergency all sectors face, and simultaneously coping with a low oil-price scenario, lower demand and the need to shore up revenue and manage debt obligations,” consultancy PwC recently said.\n\nHCL says its investment in risk management systems and processes is helping it minimise the short-term impact from the closures enforced because of Covid-19. And, that the company is adequately prepared for the medium term, if things gets worse. “We are also confident our business model will help us to emerge stronger in the longer term, as it has been built for resilience during tough times,” it added.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: How Indian companies are contributing to the war against coronavirus\n\nIT firms like HCL had started putting travel restrictions in place since February, when the novel began spreading in China and outward. The Government of India stopped all international flights from March 23, and extended the ban to domestic air travel a few days later.\n\n\n\nhave put in measures to ensure their employees work from home but IT have got an exception for some of their staffers, providing essential services to clients. “As of today, 76 per cent of our India-based employees and 92 per cent of our employees in other geographies are enabled to work from home. In certain geographies, a limited set of our employees are working from our offices, wherever it is permissible by the government and local authorities...we have not witnessed any outages or major disruption in operations with this newer format of work from home delivery,” HCL said on Monday.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3-9", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Despite several efforts to revive mandis, distribute essentials and instruct ports to facilitate exports, the situation is far from normal.\n\n\"Farmers have prepared early mango crops - Hapus or alphonso- for exports. Many in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra (the hub of Hapus mango production) had kept their consignments ready for delivery. Several enquiries were received before the lockdown. We hope the government will open exports with some riders. But, most importing markets are shut and this will make it difficult to executing orders. Thus, exports would certainly be hit,\" said Abid Raien, Director, Raien Fresh Produce, a Navi Mumbai-based fruit and vegetable exporter.\n\nMany exporters have estimated a 30-40 per cent decline in exports this season, as by the time markets open, grape season would be over. Most of the mango export season would also be lost.\n\nThe fruit and vegetable trade across India is gradually coming to a standstill due to sealing of state and district borders, which has hit plying of trucks and other carriages to mandis throughout the country. Even after easing the rules, these exporters have not become active. They have to protect themselves and also manage cancellations of orders.\n\nThe global lockdown and trade restrictions have forced large-scale cancellation of orders. Actual defaults of exporters and importers would be assessed after opening up the world markets.\n\n \n\n\n\nALSO READ: Sugar mills boost production capacity of hand sanitisers to 100K L per day\n\n\"We don't know how long this lockdown will continue. Currently, everything has cme to a halt. Even if the market opens after lockdown, the grape season will be over. The future looks uncertain for India's fruits and vegetables exports,\" said Rajesh Gumber, Chief Financial Officer, IFC Overseas, a Delhi-based exporter.\n\nData compiled by the government-owned Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) showed a 16 per cent decline in India's at $1 billion for the period between April 2019 and January 2020, from $1.19 billion for the same period the previous year.\n\nIndia's are expected to be hit badly as major import countries including the Middle East, China, United States and European Union, all of which are struggling to deal with Covid-19.\n\n\"It takes many years to build a market and many serious efforts to get customers, but few days to destroy them. We don't know whether they would be able to buy from us in future also,\" said a worried mango farmer from Sindhudurg.\n\nTo ease the problems at least on India's ports, the Union Ministry of Shipping has asked its employees to handle essential services and clear consignments wherever possible with adequate care.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union has eased its norms for import of fruits and vegetables from India under which Indian exporters do not require to submit a physical certificate assuring food safety and animal and plant health standard. Now an online certification will be sufficient.\n\nA city-based fruit exporter said that the relaxation would not have any major impact on India's fruits and vegetables exports being the European Union an insignificant importer of horticulture products from India.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB8", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

If the tender was available why didn’t they share it?” said Relhan, chair of the Preventive Wear Manufacturer Association of India.\n\nThe government banned exports of personal protective equipment on Jan. 31 to avoid shortages but other manufacturers of the equipment rued what they saw as a waste of time in getting ready to face the virus.\n\n“If we were preparing ourselves from February everyone would have been ready,” said Smita Shah, managing director of Mediklin Healthcare.\n\nFor instance, specifications India mandated included seam-tapping, which requires importing machines - a near-impossible feat now that India is under lockdown and global supply chains are frayed.\n\n“We could have imported some machines, or come up with some solution,” said Relhan.\n\nNow, medical staff lack sufficient masks, gloves and coveralls, according to the United Resident & Doctor’s Association India, which complained about the shortages in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday.\n\n“Asking a health professional to work without these essentials is like asking a soldier to ... fight without a gun,” the association said.\n\nThe group’s president, Dr Manu Gautam, said he did not have shortage estimates, but added that at least eight health workers had been infected with the coronavirus, half of them at government health centers.\n\n\n\nNow the lockdown is contributing to shortages as workers struggle to get to their plants, slowing production, manufacturers said.\n\nThe Ministry of Textiles acknowledged shortages in a March 18 meeting, according to minutes seen by Reuters.\n\nIndia needed some 725,000 coveralls and 6 million N-95 masks but “the rate of supply is not able to meet the rising demand”, the ministry said in the document.\n\nThe Textile Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe government has centralised acquisition of equipment through state-owned healthcare product manufacturer HLL Lifecare.\n\nA source at HLL Lifecare, who said it was only the health ministry that was authorized to brief media, said the company was working around the clock to provide equipment but the lockdown was slowing transport.",

It also surpassed the PM’s March 19 address when he proposed a janata curfew (83 million viewership).\n\n\n\nThe lockdown announcement was almost four times of the PM's speech, which had 57 million viewers tuning in, the report showed. The Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) is the TV audience measurement body.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also spiked television viewership on expected lines. With billions confined to homes, the average daily television viewers grew by 32 million, with each of the 592 million watching TV daily for 3.51 minutes.\n\n \n\n\n\nhas compared the data between pre-COVID-19 period (January 11 to January 31) and COVID-19 period (March 14 to March 20). During this period, the weekly viewing minutes jumped 8 per cent, while average daily reach increased 6 per cent and daily average time spent per user jumped 2 per cent. The Hindi-speaking market (HSM) saw the sharpest jump of 10 per cent in viewing minutes.\n\nViewership by kids has seen a 20 per cent jump for the age group of 2 to 14 years. What are kids watching? A whopping 83 per cent of them are watching news now. Around 40 per cent are watching kids content, and only 11 per cent are watching general entertainment channels (GECs).\n\n\n\nWith no fresh content (episodes) being created, the GECs are the worst hit in the COVID-19 crisis. These channels have seen a 5 per cent drop in daily average time spent (ATS). Amongst genres, news has seen the strongest jump, 17 per cent rise in daily ATS, while kids (11 per cent) and movies (4 per cent) come in next. Sports has a genre has suffered the most with no new content at all, a drop of 56 per cent in daily ATS.\n\n\n\nIndia Chief Executive Sunil Lulla said news as a genre had seen an increase in ad insertions. Overall, there has been a 13 per cent rise in advertising free commercial time (FCT). The highest spike came in social advertising (147 per cent), followed by banking (47 per cent), food and beverages (36 per cent), and services (22 per cent).", "categories": [{"confident": false,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 962860, "name": "Vinay Umarji"}, "body": "Even as the country goes into a 21-day lockdown starting Wednesday to contain the (Covid-19) spread, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), popularly known as Amul, is facing glitches in areas like inter-state transport and supply of packaging material.\n\nWhile so far it has not seen any major impact on milk supplies, the leading dairy co-operative is working with respective state and central government authorities to sort out the issues before it begins to impact supply.\n\nCurrently, procures 26 million litres of liquid milk a day of which 21 million litres is from Gujarat and rest from other states such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. While the dairy co-operative has been able to keep up with its average daily liquid milk sales of 15 million litres of which 6.5 million litres are sold in Gujarat and rest in other states, might face issues in supplementary services, GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi told Business Standard.\n\n\"We are ensuring that milk procurement from farmers continues with safety measures being taken. However, we are facing some problem in workers being able to reach our factories due to lockdown. But this should be gradually sorted out as we have all the permissions in place and are in touch with the relevant authorities,\" said Sodhi.\n\nIn inter-state transport, the dairy cooperative is facing delay in empty trucks coming back from other states to Gujarat after delivering milk. While trucks full with milk and milk products are being allowed to pass inter-state borders, returning empty trucks are facing delayed re-entry due to lockdown. Along with other states, Gujarat had also begun sealing its borders by March 22.\n\n\"We saw that trucks that go full are allowed at state borders but empty trucks coming back face problem at entry,\" Sodhi added.\n\nIn terms of transport, is also facing issues in supply of ingredients for cattle feed. While some of the ingredients are available within Gujarat, Amul's cattle feed plants source raw materials like rice bran, corn, millet, and molasses from other states like Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. \"These ingredients are crucial so that we can supply cattle feed to farmers so that milk procurement is not hampered,\" he said.\n\nAnother issue that could hamper Amul's supplies is packaging material. \"No factory gives more than a fortnight of packaging material. They should also be allowed to operate and there workers should be provided free movement so that milk and food items' packaging supplies do not take a hit.\"\n\nAccording to Sodhi, while so far these issues have not had any major impact on its supplies, GCMMF has made representations to relevant authorities to ensure smooth supplies of milk and milk products.\n\nMeanwhile, in a video message being circulated on social media, Sodhi is also urging consumers to not resort to panic buying amidst the 21 days lockdown.\n\n\"I want to reassure our Amul consumers that I have read the Ministry of Home Affairs' notification in detail in which milk and other food items and grocery stores are allowed to remain open. And in Gujarat we see roughly 30 million litres per day of milk production which if you divide by a population of 60 million in the state then 500 ml per person milk is available. So there is going to be no shortage of milk. Milk parlours will remain open. So I request all the consumers to not get into panic buying and buy only as much is required each day,\" Sodhi urged consumers.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB8", "level": 1, "links":

Before the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, around 4.5 mt of stocks was getting added every month on the average, however, in March 2020, the net stock addition is expected to be around 11-12 mt.\n\n \n\n\n\n“It is happening because of a cascading effect. Lower industrial activity results in lower demand for power which in turn leads to lower coal demand”, a senior Coal India official said.\n\nIn fact, during the first 15 days of this month, when the scare around Covid-19 surfaced, electricity consumption stood at 51 billion units (BU) which is 3.6 per cent lower than the demand in the same period in 2019.\n\nAccording to data from Central Electricity Authority, the is enough for plants to produce power for 24 days without any supply from Coal India.\n\nCompany sources suggested that power demand, until the first week of March had grown on a year-on-year basis, but it started to decline thereafter.\n\nThe official suggested that measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, included work from home, implying lower power demand from offices as well as schools, colleges, malls, cinema screens, parks and other public places shutting down temporarily.\n\n\"Now with the lockdown in place, demand for power is expected to go down further and hence the demand for coal as well”, the official at Coal India said.\n\n\n\nDespite the outbreak, Coal India hasn’t suspended mining operations as it feels production and supply lines of coal needs to be kept open so that power generation remains unaffected and any exigency can be addressed.\n\nAccording to a Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL-a Coal India subsidiary) official, almost all power plants linked to CCL are directly or indirectly refusing to accept more coal supply.\n\n“The hurdles faced by the company have reached to an unprecedented level, so much so that the power consumers have stopped making payments”, the CCL official said.\n\nOn the other hand, Coal India has suspended calculation of its annual stock measurement from April 1 to April 15 after the Centre and several state governments enforced mandatory travel restrictions.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB13-11", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1401310, "name": "Deepak Korgaonkar"}, "body": "The coveted club of companies with market capitalisation in excess of Rs 1 trillion has shrunk drastically in the last one month. After Monday’s sharp 13 per cent drop in the benchmark indices, there are only 18 listed firms in that club. On February 20 — just before the coronavirus-induced sell-off began —there were 30 companies with an m-cap of at least Rs 1 trillion.\n\nSeveral blue chips such as Axis Bank, Wipro, ONGC, Bajaj Finserv, and Titan have fallen off the list following unprecedented declines in their stocks. If the market continues to fall, the list could shrink further, with firms such as (L&T) hanging on to Rs 1 trillion in m-cap with the skin of their teeth.\n\nOn Monday, India Inc’s overall m-cap declined by Rs 14.2 trillion to Rs 102 trillion. Down nearly Rs 59 trillion from the peak, India’s m-cap had stood at Rs 161 trillion on January 17.\n\nNeedless to say, bulk of the erosion in terms of value took place in India’s most-valued firms. For instance, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries alone has lost Rs 3.8 trillion in m-cap, followed by HDFC Bank, which has seen its value erode by Rs 2.45 trillion and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which has lost Rs 1.85 trillion to stand at Rs 6.24 trillion, making it India’s most-valued.\n\nAt present, RIL has an m-cap of Rs 5.6 trillion, making it the second-most valuable. Only in November 2019, RIL had become India’s first company to touch Rs 10 trillion in market value.\n\nAxis Bank, which had an m-cap in excess of Rs 2 trillion about a month ago, is presently valued at Rs 87,000 crore. The private lender is the latest to move out of the club, following a 28 per cent crash in its share price.\n\nA further 2 per cent drop in the market would lead to India’s overall m-cap falling below Rs 100 trillion. India had first crossed that mark in November 2016. Interestingly, it took India five years to move from Rs 100 trillion to Rs 160 trillion. However, the reversal has taken only two months. Given the velocity of the latest correction, many experts have termed the current turmoil in the market the ‘worst ever’.\n\nExperts believe the revival could be steep on account of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\n“Indian are worst-hit as the rapidly spreading pandemic has sent major states, including the country’s capital, into a lockdown. There are increasing fears that the outbreak could bring world economies to a grinding halt. The OECD has warned that the world will take years to recover from the pandemic,” says Deepak Jasani, head (retail research), HDFC Securities.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13",

But were things back to normal post 9:00 pm?\n\nNot really. However, the next thing that happened, after the loud applause was Delhi Chief Minister in a briefing announced a complete shut down to control the spread of (Covid-19) in the region. The lock down kicked in from 6 a.m. Monday and will last till March 31.\n\nThe chief minister has mentioned that all dairies, grocery shops, chemists and petrol pumps will remain open during the period. However, no public transport service will run, with exception of 25 per cent to help people reach essential services.\n\nBut what exactly are essential services?\n\nIn this case, essential services that have been exempted from the lock down are:\n\nHospitals, food and milk supplies, chemist and pharmacies, police stations, armed forces, fire, telecom, internet, postal, e-commerce, banks, media (both print and digital) municipal and aviation services among others, keeping in view the smooth supply chain of goods.\n\nThis means, even metro train services will remain shut till March 31 and only 25 per cent of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses will hit the roads.

Police officials at the borders were seen asking people to go back and were only allowing those exempted from the lock down order.\n\n\n\nThe CM also directed private firms to give compulsory paid leave to all employees, including contractual — until the end of March.\n\nSo far, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India rose to 415 on Monday, with 15 more people testing positive in Maharashtra. While the Delhi government has already put the capital under a lock down for nine days, the Centre has also ordered all the states to enforce lock down strictly. Legal action will be taken against violators, says a notification by the government.\n\n\n\nThis comes after Prime Minister tweeted that some people were still not taking the lockdown seriously.

The department is hoping that the target will be crossed.\n\nThe reason for the higher STT is heightened volumes in the futures and options segment during April 2019 to January 2020, even as volumes fell in February. So far this fiscal year, equity derivatives turnover have gone up 43 per cent, while overall market turnover across both cash and derivatives segments was up 39 per cent.\n\nEven tax payouts from dividend distribution tax (DDT) are up 2 per cent because of changes in the tax structure from April 1, which require firms to shell out more on dividends in the next fiscal year.\n\nTypically, collections had declined during weak market conditions or fall in stock prices, but this year’s activity on the futures and options front is helping tax collections. For instance, collection dropped below Rs 500 crore in FY13 amid a downturn in the market. Since then, collection has been on the rise thanks to an upward trend in the market. In FY19, the government collected Rs 11,528 crore from STT, of which Mumbai contributed Rs 11, 235 crore.\n\nThe market performed relatively well between April 2019 and January 2020, but in February, the sharp sell-off sparked by the coronavirus outbreak pushed the Nifty and Sensex into bear territory, eroding billions of rupees of investor wealth. Total derivatives trading volume fell 22 per cent in February, while in the cash segment total volumes were down 2 per cent.\n\n\n\nIntroduced in 2004, the STT is levied on all stock market transactions. The tax is in the range of 0.017 per cent and 0.125 per cent of the transaction amount. The STT rate for delivery-based trades is 0.1 per cent, while that on intra-day trades is 0.025 per cent. Similarly, the tax levy on derivatives trade is between 0.01 per cent and 0.05 per cent, unless an option contract is exercised.\n\nMeanwhile, DDT collection (up to March 15) stood at Rs 51,873 crore. Of this domestic companies paid Rs 46,720 crore and mutual funds payout was Rs 5,153 crore. In FY19, the total collection was Rs 57,114 crore, according to data.\n\nThis is because dividends payouts were advanced by the companies in February after the Union Budget announced changes in DDT structure. The Budget announced abolition of DDT of 20.56 per cent paid by companies, but said taxes on dividends would be levied on individuals.\n\nMarket players say companies are advancing their dividend payouts to lower the tax burden of promoters, who will have to pay tax in excess of 40 per cent from April. In February, about 200 companies declared interim dividends, which was over double that of the corresponding period last year. Payouts, too, were higher than last year. Total direct tax (net collection) up to March 15, however, slipped by 5.3 per cent and stood at Rs 9.57 trillion against the revised target of Rs 11.7 trillion.", "categories": [{"confident": true,

In a notification, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE, said it would be business as usual and all market segments will operate normally.\n\nWell, here is a piece of history. The two instances the were shut by authorities was back in 1993 and in 2008 in the wake of terror attacks in Mumbai. The 1993 terror attack was a series of 12 bomb explosions that rocked Mumbai (then known as Bombay), on 12 March. The single-day attacks resulted in 317 fatalities and 1,400 injuries, according to reports. Among the targeted locations was the building in Fort.\n\nMore recently in 2008, a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai shook the city between November 26 till November 28. The stock exchanges, as a result was closed for trading on November 27 in response to the development.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the health and safety is of paramount importance, analysts say shutting the exchange now for a prolonged duration in the backdrop of COVID-19 can send a wrong signal to foreign investors.\n\n“Foreign investors have a huge investment in the Indian financial and shutting the exchange for long will send out a wrong signal. That said, the authorities have taken appropriate steps to ensure safety of employees and also taken adequate measures that the investors / traders and the other stakeholders do not panic,” says G Chokkalingam, founder and managing director at Equinomics Research.\n\nForeign investors as it is have been on a selling spree thus far in March given the COVID-19-related developments. According to the available data, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have sold a net $4.9 billion of Indian equities thus far in the current month. Eight of the top-10 Indian companies saw a combined loss of Rs 3.63 trillion in market valuation last week, with HDFC Bank taking the biggest hit.\n\nMeanwhile, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday halved position limits for certain stock futures, restricted short-selling of index derivatives and raised margin rates for some shares in a bid to curb volatility.

This came after the (ED) submitted before the court that it does not need Kapoor’s custody any further.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has also moved a production warrant to take Kapoor into custody. The CBI had filed a case against Kapoor for allegedly obtaining illegal gratification by acquiring a property in New Delhi from Gautam Thapar’s Avantha group. In exchange, waived the industrial house’s dues and advanced new loans.\n\n\n\nEarlier, Kapoor’s ED custody was extended by four days to March 20 while the ED had asked for a six-day custody. The former banker was arrested on March 8 by the ED under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and was since in the probe agency’s custody.\n\n\n\nKapoor told the court on Friday that he is suffering from asthma, and because of his age, he is vulnerable to coronavirus. The court has asked the jail authorities to take appropriate precautions on this count.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a number of high profile corporate promoters were summoned by the investigative agency, including Anil Ambani, Naresh Goyal, Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, Subash Chandra and Sameer Gehlaut in connection with the case.\n\nAnil Ambani was questioned by the ED on Thursday and asked to furnish some important details which are crucial for the case, said an ED official. Ambani’s Reliance group is among the largest borrowers of the bank, with an exposure of around Rs 13,000 crore. \n\n\n\nAmbani sought more time from the agency to provide further clarifications on some specific queries. The probe agency has asked him to appear again on March 30. Other big defaulters of YES Bank, who had been summoned by the ED to appear this week, did not show up.\n\n\n\nDuring investigations, the probe agency found that a loan of Rs 202 crore was sanctioned to Mack Star Marketing, which is a joint venture among HDIL promoters Sarang Wadhawan & Rakesh Wadhawan, former Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank chairman Waryam Singh and the De Shaw group. \n\n\n\nThe first three hold only 16.64 per cent shares in the entity while the De Shaw group holds majority stake. The ED found that the loan of Rs 202 crore, sanctioned to Mack Star Marketing, was used by HDIL to pay off its previous loans. The loan was sanctioned to the entity with the specific purpose of renovating its office building.\n\nFurther investigations have revealed that about 78 companies owned by Kapoor’s family members were being controlled and managed by Kapoor himself.\n\nThe ED has also found that had bought debentures of Dewan Housing (DHFL) worth Rs 3,700 crore while the latter gave a loan to a company owned by Kapoor’s daughters for Rs 600 crore.\n\nBoth the transactions were suspicious as the company owned by Kapoor’s daughters did not have sufficient businesses or assets. Also, the mortgage shown for the loan was only a property worth around Rs 40 crore. The property mortgaged was an agricultural land shown as residential land with its worth inflated.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB13-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

It's going to take 12 to 18 months until you have a registered vaccine on the market.\"\n\n \n\n Rajeev Venkayya, president of the Global Vaccines Business Unit at Takeda Pharmaceuticals, said that timeline was \"very aggressive but we think it might be feasible\".\n\nDozens of clinical trials for vaccines and treatments are under way around the world after the virus's genome was shared by China, where COVID-19 first broke out in December.\n\nBut industry chiefs said they could not lower the testing standards to get a preventative vaccine on the market more quickly.\n\n\"You're injecting this into healthy people, so you don't want to have suddenly people getting sick because you are short-cutting,\" said Loew.\n\n\"It could also have deleterious effects on other vaccines, if people lose trust in vaccination,\" he added.\n\n\"The regulatory authorities are cutting red tape, and that's the way we can accelerate getting to the market quicker.\"\n\n\n\nVenkayya added that some, if not most of the testing programmes being run, would fail to produce a viable vaccine.\n\nHowever, the value of running multiple trials simultaneously was that \"some will succeed and get across the finish line\", he said.\n\nVenkayya said the industry would \"prioritise access and equity in the distribution\" of any effective vaccine.\n\nPaul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson and Johnson, said the industry would make sure that any vaccine, wherever it is produced, \"will be available\" to everyone \"who needs it\" across the globe.\n\n\"That's a promise for what we are doing jointly as an industry,\" he stressed.\n\nStoffels said the problem in reaching solutions was that the virus had new characteristics compared to outbreaks such as SARS.\n\n\"This virus is extremely transmittable -- and that's what is so new. So it's a new virus which needs new tools, and that's where we have to start from scratch on the research.\"\n\n \n\n Meanwhile Ricks said money was not the issue for pharmaceutical giants in finding solutions.\n\n\"This is not a capital resource problem right now, more of a human resource problem,\" he said.\n\nRicks said nobody in the industry was talking about how to take the credit and make money out of vaccines and treatments, while public-private partnerships could help share any financial risks.\n\nIFPMA director-general Thomas Cueni said the industry was putting on an unprecedented united front to conquer the virus.\n\n\"We won't rest until we find the solution,\" he said.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 973253, "name": "Krishna Kant"}, "body": "Lenders’ exposure to the travel and hospitality sectors is at risk because of the economic disruption from the novel (COVID-19). The 65 listed companies in the sector had combined outstanding loans worth around Rs 30,500 crore at the end of September 2019, up 37.2 per cent year-on-year (YoY) compared to the corresponding period a year ago.\n\nThe companies had total loan outstanding of around Rs 22,200 crore at the end of September 2018.\n\nHotels are the biggest borrowers followed by airlines. Hotel chains such as Indian Hotels, Chalet Hotels, Lemon Tree Hotels, and Asian Hotels (North) accounted for around 50 per cent of the combined borrowings of firms that Business Standard analysed. (See the adjoining chart)\n\n \n\n\n\nThe analysis excluded unlisted large borrowers such as Air India and defunct companies such as Jet Airways, Cox & Kings and Kingfisher Airlines.\n\nAmong individual companies, SpiceJet was the most indebted in the industry. The airline had total outstanding debt of around Rs 8,800 crore at the end of September 2019, against Rs 1,217 crore a year ago. It was followed by Coffee Day Enterprises, which had debt worth Rs 6,500 crore at the end of September 2019, up from Rs 4,410 crore a year ago; Indian Hotels (Rs 3,500 crore); and, Mahindra Holidays (Rs 1,770 crore).\n\nAirlines are facing the brunt of the disruption caused by COVID-19 as countries restrict air travel and travelers themselves cancel holiday plans. A prolonged decline in air travel is likely to hit SpiceJet’s finances, given its highly leveraged balance sheet. Its debt of around Rs 8,800 crore at the end of September 2019 was backed by a negative net worth of Rs 461 crore, putting the airline and its lender in a financially vulnerable position.\n\nIn comparison, market leader Interglobe Aviation that runs IndiGo had total outstanding debt of around Rs 622 crore at the end of first half of financial year 2019-20 (H1FY20), backed by net worth of around Rs 6,200 crore. This gives it a greater resilience to survive the downturn.\n\nIn the hospitality or hotel industry, smaller chains such as Lemon Tree Hotels, Asian Hotels (North), and Asian Hotels (West) look more vulnerable to a downturn than their larger peers such as Indian Hotels, EIH and Chalet Hotels. In the first nine months of FY20 (9MFY20), these smaller hotels chains had much lower interest coverage ratio (ICR) — a measure of the company’s debt servicing ability — than larger and well established chains.\n\nFor example, Lemon Tree Hotels, which reported total borrowings of Rs 1,285 crore at the end of September 2019 has ICR of 1.6x compared to 3.3x for Indian Hotels and 6.5x for EIH. Similarly, Asian Hotels (North) reported ICR of 0.6x, which was close to a default, while Asian Hotels (West) had ICR of 1.5x during 9MFY20. A company with ICR below 1.5x is treated by rating agencies as being close to default.\n\nCoffee Day Enterprises could also face financial difficulty. The café chain operator reported total debt of around Rs 6,500 crore at the end of March 2019, backed by net worth of around Rs 2,530 crore. This translated into an uncomfortably high debt to equity ratio of 2.6x at the end of March 2019.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-18", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

It has also been signed by several venture capitalists such as Kalaari Capital’s Chirag Gandhi and Accel Partners’ Prashanth Prakash.\n\nThe group claims that India could have between 600-2,500 positive cases as compared to the current 137 reported in the country as learnings from Wuhan suggest actual undiagnosed cases are typically 5-20 times the diagnosed cases. It also points out that countries which have acted early and strongly such as South Korea, Singapore, and Japan have been able to bring down cases compared to those which waited and watched such as Iran, Italy and France. “Hence, while containment efforts should continue, imposing a lock-down and Section 144 now versus 30 days later might reduce deaths by 5 times,” says the note.\n\nIt suggests that from March 20 to April 12 there should be Section 144 across all major affected areas, businesses should work from home, and stores, schools, cinemas all should be shut down and public transport should run on a limited need basis.\n\nIn the second stage, between April 13 and May 17, the government should reassess the situation and lift off Section 144 in most if not all places.

However, companies are not sure whether an increase in April will be possible in the wake of the virus outbreak.\n\nM C Agrawal, executive director (sales & ITD), Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), said the price increase in March was holding. \"There is no change in demand which is already recovering. Auto has also started picking up.\"\n\n\"Whether an increase in price will happen in April is difficult to say,\" he added. But he sounded confident about a recovery in demand for steel. \"There is a fear factor right now because of coronavirus, but things will settle. At best, the pick-up could be delayed by a month or two,\" he said.\n\nFor the time being there could be some ups and downs due to coronavirus, said Hervinder Singh, president- mining & international projects, Jindal Steel & Power Limited (JSPL). \"Prices are holding for this month,\" he added.\n\n\"The India story is very positive, and at JSPL, we have crossed all records in production,\" Singh said. The last quarter was the best so far, and this quarter ending in March will be even better,\" he added. JSPL is ramping up capacity and expects to end 2020-2021 with 8.5 million tonnes.\n\nThe steel sector has been gradually recovering from lows since November. The price of HRC had touched a low of Rs 32,250 in the first week of November. have been clawing back month-on-month since November.\n\nHowever, primary and secondary producers are unsure how the virus outbreak would play out in the next few weeks. The secondary producers said that the sentiments had hugely been impacted by the outbreak.\n\n\"There is no visibility on where things are headed right now,\" said a secondary producer. ICRA, in a recent report on the sector, said that prices were expected to come under pressure in the near term as an aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe price rise in India was in line with the global trend. Chinese export HRC prices had increased from $428 a tonne end-October to $496 a tonne in January 2020, ICRA noted. However, since mid-January, due to a slowdown in China's steel consumption, following outbreak, prices had witnessed a six per cent fall.\n\nBut producers pointed out that the situation in China had now been contained and shipments were moving out while that in Europe was spiralling out of control. For the steel producers, though China is not a major market, it is a source for consumables and spares. A major steel producer said that right now there was no threat to business continuity.\n\nThe domestic were currently trading at a discount of seven per cent to landed cost from China and at a discount of three per cent to landed cost from Japan, said ICRA.\n\n\"While this provides a headroom to domestic steelmakers to increase steel prices, rising number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in India remains a concern, and the same along with continuing macroeconomic headwinds, could affect domestic steel consumption and pressurise steel prices in the coming months,\" it said.\n\nConsequently, ICRA expects the domestic steel consumption growth to remain between four and five per cent in FY2021 as against the November 2019 forecast of 6.5 per cent.", "categories":

This despite the sharp reversal last week and the subsequent claw-back.\n\n\n\nToday with the support of a lower rupee against the dollar, standard gold (995) in the Mumbai physical market opened 1.9 per cent higher at Rs 44,097 per 10 grams, a surge of almost Rs 2,000 jump in this week, and a Rs 3,000 rise in two weeks. After considering 3 per cent GST, the price has already crossed Rs 45,000 mark. Silver, however, has moved only marginally higher despite the fact that it is emerging as the poor man’s gold now.\n\nPrices in India are trading at a huge discount to the cost of imports. Gold opened at a discount of about one per cent today and was later trading at a markdown of as much as 1.5 per cent, or $16-22 an ounce, to the cost of imported metal during the day.\n\nJewellers are saying only need-based purchases, such as those made during marriages, are evident. Demand has otherwise evaporated. Their expectation is that once all central banks announce their stimuli, the market may see some profit-booking. Consequently there could be a small dip in gold prices, attracting customers to the market again.\n\nIn the international market, there was a slight reversal in the price after the metal surged over $1,680 within a span of a week. The price had started moving up after California declared a state of emergency amid the outbreak that has taken 11 American lives so far and infected more than 100 others.\n\nMetal focus, a London-based consultancy, said in its latest report that apart from the spreading of the virus to newer areas and Federal Reserve's sharp cut in interest rates, “the impact of political turmoil and geopolitical tensions also proved to be a positive for the metal. Among the various problems, some that stand out include uncertainties ahead of the US presidential election, uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations and ongoing tensions across the Middle East.”\n\nThe world Gold Council data released last night show that Global gold-backed exchange-traded funds (gold ETFs) and similar products added 84.5 tonnes, or net inflows of $4.9 billion, across all regions in February, boosting holdings to an all-time highs of 3,033 tonnes. The spike in saw them deliver a return of 4.4 per cent in a month, breaching the previous September 2012 record high.\n\nThe council also stated that in 2012, gold was ruling 10 per cent higher than current levels and that US investors have not yet raised their gold allocations as much as they did in 2012.\n\nMetal focus said political and economic conditions suggest that, institutional investors’ appetite for gold will go up further. Investor positions are high in both tonnage and value terms at present, though they are far lower than previous peaks. This will leave considerable room for further rotation by mainstream investors into gold from stock and bond", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Until last week, probably no one had sensed how massive the overall adverse effect of Coronavirus would be. The moment it started spreading rapidly outside China, things became worse and this eventually resulted into a complete meltdown in global For us, we saw some hope of revival on Thursday but Friday’s huge gap down followed by sustained selling poured water on it. Eventually, we concluded by registering the biggest weekly cut after 2008.\n\nThere was no respect shown for any major support as we saw breaching of crucial points one after another. Honestly speaking, no analysis works in such kind of fearsome environment. Although, the next path of action is solely dependent on further developments with respect to coronavirus; but still, let us see where we stand now and what are the next key levels to watch.\n\nAt present, we are placed precisely at the 161 per cent retracement of the recent up move from 11,614.50 to 12,246.70. In case if the Nifty slides further, then the last ray of hope would be the lower end of multi-year ‘Upward Sloping Channel’ placed at 11,000. On the upside, Friday’s huge gap area of 11,384.80 – 11,536.70 remains to be an immediate hurdle. In our sense, if any sustainable recovery has to happen this week, it should be V-shaped or steep in nature. If that doesn’t happen and if the recovery is gradual, that would be an ominous sign for the bulls.\n\nMomentum traders are advised to stay light and should avoid leveraged positions in such kind of global uncertainty. But having said that, historically it’s been proven that such panics generally offer very good opportunity for investors who are willing to build their portfolio.

Yet with Chinese and Hong Kong exchanges shut for an extended holiday, that’s a lowball figure.\n\nAs Treasuries drift and US stock-futures gain in early Tuesday trading, the epidemic’s toll looms large across assets. Raw materials have been hit hardest, with the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index slumping 4.5 per cent. Meanwhile havens have rallied as investors seek safety.\n\nThe Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Treasuries Total Return Index is up 1.3 per cent, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has strengthened 0.5 per cent.\n\nHere’s a look at how the major global asset classes have reacted so far.\n\nStocks: With the virus originating inside its borders, China’s stocks have borne the brunt of its spread. Though local remain shuttered until Febuary 3, futures on the FTSE China A50 Index have fallen over 10 per cent since January 20. Equities across the world have slumped, with Asia the worst-performing region while European shares have emerged relatively unscathed.\n\nBonds: Investors have been rushing to the comfort of US Treasuries with year-to-date declines in 10-year yields now sitting at over 30 basis points. The global benchmark yield has fallen out of the uptrend it was in since September, with a growing number of strategists targeting 1.5 per cent. The move has reverberated across the globe, with rates on bonds at the lowest since October and Australian equivalents back below 1 per cent. The market value of negative-yielding debt jumped on Monday by $860 billion, the most in a day since Bloomberg began tracking the data regularly three years ago.\n\nCommodities: Traders are dumping oil and industrial metals on fears the virus will crimp worldwide demand. WTI crude has fallen around 9 per cent since January 20, putting it on course for the biggest monthly decline since May. But gold is showcasing its long-standing reputation as a haven in troubled times, trading near the highest close in more than six years.\n\nCurrencies: The historic calm in currency markets snapped as the outbreak gained traction, with the offshore yuan sliding to its weakest level this year. That pushed dollar-yuan above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, with traders watching closely as the pair nears 7, an important psychological level.", "categories": [{"confident": true,

One thing that makes this gradual slowdown more serious than the ones experienced before is that it came without any external shock. Also, the data shows the slump has covered all the sectors.\n\nis weakening, as is the job-generating (chart 1).\n\nAgriculture and public spending are the only green shoots of the economy, and the concentration of the slowdown in the core economy is becoming sharper (chart 2). Core GVA is the gross value added in the economy without that in the farm sector and public administration. Consumer spending grew at 2.7 per cent in the March quarter, while investments contracted for a third straight month, falling faster than the preceding quarter every time (chart 3).\n\nThe data also showed the economy grew slower than initially estimated in the first half of the fiscal year 2019-20. For example, the output from construction activities was 6 per cent lower than what it had been estimated (chart 4) in November 2019. The economic slump, which began after demonetisation and implementation of the GST, has shown no signs of recovery until the end of FY20 (chart 5). The Covid economic shock would play over and above this pre-existing slowdown.\n\nSlowing of growth has had a definite impact on the Centre’s revenues, but revenue spending, most of which is salaries, and interest payments, has grown massively (chart 6). Capital expenditure has grown slower over years. While the gap between capex and fiscal deficit was narrowing till FY17, it blew out of proportions in FY20. Fiscal deficit neared Rs 10 trillion last year, and its quality deteriorated\n\n(chart 7). These underline the limitations the Centre faces in giving a direct stimulus to the economy.\n\nStatsGuru is a weekly feature.

Salil Parekh, who is presently the CEO & MD at was a member of the Group Executive Board ay looking after the company’s UK, Asia Pacific and financial services business before joining the Bengaluru firm in January 2018.\n\non Friday announced that Delaporte who is Capgemini’s chief operating officer and also a member of the group executive board, would join the company as its CEO & MD, effective July 6, 2020. A French national, he would be based out of Paris. also said that since Neemuchwala would leave the company from June 1, its chairman Rishad Premji would oversee the daily operations of the firm during this interim period.\n\nDuring his twenty-five year career with Capgemini, Delaporte held several leadership roles including that of chief executive officer of the global financial services strategic business unit, and head of all global service lines. His experience in overseeing Capgemini’s India operations- one of the largest delivery centres of the company- is likely to put him in good stead in managing the operations of Wipro. He has a bachelor’s degree in economy and finance from Sciences Po Paris and a Masters in Law from Sorbonne University.\n\n“I am delighted to welcome Thierry as CEO and Managing Director of the company. Thierry has an exceptional leadership track record, strong international exposure, deep strategic expertise, a unique ability to forge long-standing client relationships, and proven experience of driving transformation and managing technological disruption. We believe that Thierry is the right person to lead Wipro in its next phase of growth,” said Rishad Premji, Chairman at Wipro Ltd. “I want to thank Abid for all that he has done for Wipro and for making this transition as smooth and seamless as possible despite his personal commitments.”\n\nThe appointment has come at a time when Wipro continues to lag its peers in driving top line growth in the past years.\n\nIn the past years, Wipro has taken many steps to realign its business operations for driving faster growth under the incumbent CEO like. While the West Asia business of the IT services firm has been restructured, Indian business has also been reorganised by carving out a separate unit for state-run public sector undertakings and government organisations from enterprise business. The IT services firm has also divested its low margin data centre business as part of its portfolio restructuring initiatives.\n\nDespite all these measures, Wipro posted 1.7 per cent growth in its revenues from IT segment at $8.256 billion in the last financial year. So, the appointment is critical for the IT services firm to accelerate its revenue growth at a time when the industry is staring at a dip in demand owing to ongoing Covid-19 crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Wipro also announced the appointment of Deepak M Satwalekar, a financial services professional and former MD of HDFC Ltd, to its board of directors for five years effective July 1, 2020.",

This is billed as the steepest fall for the industry in any year. Capacity utilisation in FY21 is seen at 40-45 per cent.\n\nEven before the onset of Covid-19, cement producers were wrestling with an economic slump. In the last fiscal, cement output fell by 0.8 per cent as against a growth of 13.3 per cent registered in FY19.\n\n“The was already impacted by the general economic slowdown prevalent in the economy and now with the Covid-19 pandemic prevalent, it has further added on to the weakness present in the industry even though the macros seem strong in the long term. is usually closely in-line with demand which is also poised to fall sharply given the related restrictions present as the virus is showing no signs of abating. The nationwide has come at the time when construction activities is at its peak and it will be followed by the monsoon season where again the construction activity will be impacted thereby affecting entire dynamics of demand-supply for cement”, said a report from CARE Ratings.\n\nAfter easing of curbs, cement manufacturers have resumed operations. However, due to limited manpower availability and logistics constraints, the plants are running at depleted capacity. Logistics and transportation continue to be a stumbling block as priority of Railways is on transporting essential goods.\n\nDue to bleak outlook and unfavourable business conditions, cement companies are unlikely to make fresh additions to existing Capex (Capital expenditure) as demand stays muted. Besides, some of the players are likely to defer Capex spends.\n\nFlagging demand in the domestic market has unnerved cement makers as India is the world’s second-largest cement market, both in production and consumption.\n\n“Weakness in housing demand, prolonged rains in many parts of the country and decline in demand from the infrastructure segment due to lack of funding and halting/temporary stoppage of state projects following change in government post state elections has had a negative bearing on the production of cement in the domestic markets. The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Indian sub-continent which forced the government to announce a nationwide lockdown from March 25 onwards also affected the domestic during FY20. Construction activity across the country was halted, which is normally at its peak in the month of March, affected the cement offtake. Production fell by 24.7 per cent during March 2020 as compared with the 15.7 per cent growth achieved during March 2019”, the report added.\n\nAs per the Cement Manufacturers Association, India accounts for eight per cent of the world’s installed capacity. The nameplate capacity of cement manufacturers has increased at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.1 per cent during FY16-FY20. Manufacturers maintained a capacity utilisation rate of 65-70 per cent between FY15 and FY19. But prolonged rains and government-enforced nationwide lockdown shrunk the capacity utilisation rate from 70 per cent in FY19 to 61 per cent in FY20.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

A total of 442.6 million shares are being offered in the rights issue, nearly half of this will be subscribed to by promoters, as they hold 50.07 per cent stake.\n\nALSO READ: Sebi shifts to NCL building as another staffer tests coronavirus-positive\n\nOne RE will give an investor the option to subscribe to one RIL share in the rights issue, which too opened simultaneously on Wednesday. On the first day, the issue subscribed about a per cent, however, bulk of the subscription in any rights offering comes closer to the last day of the issue, which is June 3 for RIL.\n\nOn the NSE, the closing price of RIL RE was Rs 212, nearly 40 per cent higher than the opening price of Rs 152. Trading in RIL RE will continue till May 29.\n\nRIL has fixed the price at Rs 1,257 per share. Meanwhile, shares of RIL closed at Rs 1,437.4, up 2 per cent on Wednesday. The difference between the current price and price is Rs 180.4, or 14.35 per cent. Technically, the cost of acquisition for one share for those buying REs in the secondary market works out to Rs 1,469 (Rs 1,257 plus RE price of Rs 212).\n\nMarket players said the premium of Rs 32 was to factor in interests cost.\n\n“Investors have to pay only a fourth of the amount now. The remaining 75 per cent over next 18 months. Purely by adding interest cost of 9 per cent for an 18-month period, those buying RE at current price still stand a chance to make money. The underlying assumption, however, is that you are bullish on the prospects of RIL,” said SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com, an investment advisory firm.\n\nRIL rights issue is carried out in three trances. At first shareholders have to pay 25 per cent of the issue price (Rs 314.25), another 25 per cent (Rs 314.25) in May next year and the remaining 50 per cent (Rs 628.5) in November 2021. Those participating in the rights issue will have to make these staggered payments irrespective of where RIL shares trade in the secondary market.\n\nALSO READ: I've to be careful, am answerable to Parliament: FM Nirmala Sitharaman\n\nMany brokerages have advising their clients to subscribe to the RIL rights issue.\n\n“We are recommending investors to subscribe to the rights issue as we are positive on the future prospects given the strong traction in digital and retail business. Based on sum of the parts valuation we have a target price of Rs 1,748,” said Jyoti Roy, DVP Equity Strategist, Angel Broking.\n\nTulsian said there is scope for the RIL RE price to move up even more

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1338769, "name": "Joydeep Ghosh"}, "body": "At a time when the economy is likely to see a severe contraction, we continue to apply band-aid. There was hope after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a Rs 20-trillion package, roughly translating into 10 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Rs 21 trillion largesse doesn’t translate into more cash-in-hand for most. For example, the Rs 3-trillion central government guaranteed credit line for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sounds great. After all, there will be a moratorium of one year. But the interest will accumulate for one year and will have to be paid later. Yes, MSMEs are facing severe problems due to cash crunch, but will they borrow more, produce goods and pay salaries in these uncertain times? Let’s see. Similarly, the two per cent reduction in Employee Provident Fund benefit for employers and employees will not give too much benefit to either. Anyway, it is only for three months.\n\nThe Indian economy was already suffering from a downturn before the Covid crisis hit us. Last September, the government gave hefty tax sops to India Inc. Result: Due to the reduction in tax liabilities, the price-to-earnings ratio improved. The markets cheered for a few days. But as days went by, there was a clear realisation that no fresh investments will happen because there was no demand.\n\nAt the same time, non-banking financial companies went into deeper stress as people stopped borrowing and there was a general fear about lending money to these firms. When the skeletons came out of the cupboards, the realisation dawned that many of these were riding tigers. For example, the monthly interest liability of a non-banking financial company was Rs 1,500 crore on a loan book of around Rs 1 lakh crore. This NBFC was clearly raising money at an unaffordable rate during a falling interest rate regime.\n\nThen, Covid-19 happened. And the lockdown began. Now, after 50 days of the lockdown, a grand stimulus package has been announced. But it again focusses mostly on the supply side, and reforms that will give results in months or years later.\n\nMeanwhile, demand has suffered badly. Most companies, barring an odd Asian Paints, have announced salary or job cuts… some of them severe ones. Even the central and state governments have cut salaries so one cannot blame the private sector only. So, in terms of income, an upper middle class family will most likely going to be downgraded to middle class, middle class to lower middle class and so on.\n\nSo car companies can make cars, builders may build houses, banks may lower interest rates, malls may open and there could be grand discounts at the best hotels, but few would be able to or interested in spending on such luxuries. The ones who do aren’t dependent on salaries but dividend incomes. Instead, there will be downtrading. A Pears soap user may go for Lux. And a Lux user may seek comfort in Lifebuoy.\n\nManaging such times is an ‘out of syllabus exercise’ for any government. But this could be a good time for free lunches and tax holidays. A one-year tax income holiday for everyone or up to a certain salary level is likely to ensure that people don’t down trade or defer basic expenses. Yes, a car or home buying may not happen immediately, but even being able to maintain the existing lifestyle will help growth and India Inc.\n\nFew would want a loan currently, but most need a free lunch. Since the nineties, successive governments have sold the ‘middle-class spending power’ dream to attract investments from global companies. It’s time to protect it.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13", "parent": null}, "score":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1083634, "name": "Anish Kumar"}, "body": "Cricket is set to do away with one of its oldest practices -- the use of saliva to polish the ball – as (ICC) is gearing up to resume the operations amid (Covid-19) pandemic.\n\n  \n\n The ICC cricket committee led by has recommended some changes in the existing rules. The recommendation included banning the use of saliva, no neutral umpires and increase the use of Decision Review System (DRS).\n\n  \n\n However, the ICC Cricket Committee saw no health hazard in continuing with the use of sweat.\n\nSo, how the cricket as we know it is going to be changed in post-Covid-19 world:The use of saliva to polish the ball has been a significant method used from early 90s, which help the bowler to reverse swing the ball after it gets old. If ICC accepts the recommendation on use of saliva, then it would be very hard for the bowler to get the swing. This will make the batsman more dominant. But the committee advocated the use of bowler-friendly pitches to balance the gap.The headed committee, though, allowed the use of sweat to shine.Recently, Australian manufacturer Kookaburra has also said that it will ready a wax applicator as an alternative to saliva and sweat to help bowlers shine cricket balls in the post Covid-19 world.\"Kookaburra's research and development centre in Australia has been working on a product to replace the traditional methods of polishing a ball that could be controlled and managed by the match umpire. We have developed a unique wax formula for polishing a cricket ball,\" Brett Elliott, group managing director of the brand, said on May 5.\"The pocket size sponge applicator would enable umpires or players to apply a thin layer of wax which could then be rubbed and polished in a traditional manner to enhance the shine on the ball,\" Kookaburra’s MD said.According to cricket website ESPNcricinfo, the cricket committee has discussed the use of artificial substance for shinning the ball. But, it felt that the use of any artificial substance on the ball is termed as ball-tampering under the existing law. The Kumble-led committee felt bending the rule at present would lead to complications.The committee also suggested the re-introduction of two non-neutral umpires in bilateral series at least till the time travelling becomes safer.\"Given the challenges of international travel with borders being closed, limited commercial flights and mandatory quarantine periods, the Committee recommended that local match officials be appointed in the short-term,\" the governing body stated in its release.The concept of having two neutral umpires officiating in matches came in 2002. From 1994 to 2001, it involved one local and one neutral umpire.The committee said that the appointments will continue to be made via the ICC from local Elite and International Panel referees and umpires.Where there are no Elite Panel match officials in the country, the best local International Panel match officials will be appointed.This effectively means that Anil Chaudhary, Shamshuddin and Nitin Menon can officiate in Test matches in India.However, the neutral umpires have been brought in the Test matches so that it would not favour the home team. The cricket committee also addressed this problem by suggesting the use of technology.In case non-neutral umpires are introduced, then teams may get an additional review (currently two per innings).\"The Committee also recommended that the use of technology is increased to support the appointments of a wider pool of umpires from around the world and has proposed an additional review per team per innings is introduced in each format as an interim measure.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-9", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

She also said the tax concessions announced since March 22 had cost the exchequer Rs 7,800 crore.\n\nAs part of the March 26 package of Rs 1.7 trillion, the FM announced measures regarding free foodgrain distribution to 800 million people, one-time cash transfer to senior citizens, women and divyangs, and free gas cylinders for three months to Ujjwala beneficiaries. All this is expected to cost around Rs 92,000 crore\n\nOn May 13, the FM announce measures worth Rs 5.94 trillion, to provide relief to MSMEs, taxpayers, NBFCs, power distribution companies, real estate sector, organised sector employees, and contractors. Most of these were on the liquidity and credit side. Analysts differ on the direct fiscal impact of this set, with estimates ranging from Rs 19,800-41,000 crore. A top government official clarified that the outlay from Wednesday’s measures will be around Rs 35,000 crore, including some initial support from the Centre to boost the liquidity measures announced. These may be spread out over multiple years.\n\n \n\n\n\nALSO READ: Govt to privatise non-strategic PSUs, suspend new bankruptcy filings\n\nOn May 14, the FM’s measures totalled Rs 3.1 trillion.

The last point was not mentioned by Sitharaman.\n\nMay 15’s announcements focused on the rural and agriculture sector and totalled Rs 1.5 trillion. Around Rs 35,000 is expected to come from the Centre’s Budget over the next two-five fiscal years on schemes such as formalisation of micro food enterprises, matsaya sampada yojana, promotion of herbal cultivation beekeeping initiatives, and others.\n\nOut of May 16’s announcements, which analysts estimate totalled around Rs 63,000 crore, about Rs 8,100 crore will be towards increased viability gap funding for social infrastructure projects like hospitals and schools.

There will only be a gradual return to normalcy.\n\nToll collections and remittances from roads will fall a sharp 13% assuming there is only a 57-day lockdown (from March 22 to May 17). That decline will be an even sharper 17% if the lockdown is extended by another two weeks.\n\n \n\n\n\nALSO READ: Three UPA-era initiatives prove crucial in Modi govt's war on Covid\n\nWhile construction of new highways is also affected, those constructed and commissioned over the past one year will help reduce the rate of decline in toll collections by more than half.\n\nOver the long term (up to FY24), Research expects toll collections to bounce back to a healthier compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11-12% on the back of new road construction. This, however, is lower than the 14.6% clocked in the preceding five financial years.\n\nNew road executions will hold the key to both reducing the impact of the lockdown in the immediate term and boosting growth over the long term.\n\nAny further increase will likely come from new national highways. The executed 3,979 km of national highways in fiscal 2020 compared with 3,380 km in fiscal 2019.\n\nThat growth was driven by order backlog and the award of appointed dates for delayed hybrid annuity model (HAM) projects. The pace of execution is expected to pick up further to 3,500-4,000 km per year between fiscals 2021 and 2024.\n\nWhile new highway completion is expected to fall 20-25% from the initial expectation this fiscal, completions of last would help stem a slide in numbers, said.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Tough times for sugar mills as demand from business consumers dwindles\n\nOur base-case scenario (with lockdown ending on May 17) is traffic on existing stretches would de-grow 16.5% in fiscal 2021. Although some relaxations have been provided for the manufacturing sector in the recent guidelines, these are unlikely to help the sector revive immediately because of multiple factors such as hampered supply chains, persisting labour issues and slack end-consumer demand.\n\nThe lockdwon will have an adverse impact on the consumption of major commodities and therefore construction materials such as cement and steel, which account for a high share of freight traffic, will see a significant drop in consumption due to the fall in construction activity in fiscal 2021. Some other major commodities, such as agri produce and e-commerce, are, however, expected to support the freight traffic, thereby lowering the rate of de-growth.", "categories": [{"confident": true,

Mindtree posted strong numbers — and its highest-ever deal wins, at $393 million — and its management's commentary on deal pipeline and room for margin expansion was more optimistic than those of its bigger peers.\n\nHere's a look at what analysts expect from Tech Mahindra's March-quarter result announcement:\n\nThe brokerage expects the company's US dollar revenues to grow 1 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to $1,367 million, mainly driven by the partial contribution of its Born group acquisition, the AT&T deal, and the Jackson National Life Insurance deal. Rupee revenues may grow 2.6 per cent QoQ and 11.4 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 9,903 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) is seen at Rs 1,554.8 crore, down 0.5 per cent QoQ and 5.1 per cent YoY. Profit after tax (PAT) is estimated at Rs 1,040.4 crore, down 8.1 per cent YoY and 9.2 per cent QoQ. \"Ebitda margins could decline 50 bps QoQ to 15.7 per cent on account of the continuity of large deal transition cost in the quarter partially offset by rupee depreciation,\" the brokerage said.\n\nIt expects a revenue decline, despite the contribution of $10 million of incremental revenues from Born acquisition ($15 mn quarterly revenue run rate) and Prudential deal ramp-up due to the revenue decline in Italy-based Pininfarina, shutdown in Wuhan impacting China revenues, lower revenues from AT&T contract, and the cancellation of a few network ramp programmes. After strong September and December 2019 quarters, the brokerage expects new order wins to move back to $300-400 million range.\n\nIt expects Ebitda to slip 7.4 per cent YoY and 2.9 per cent QoQ to Rs 1,517.4 crore. PAT is expected to decline 21.9 per cent YoY and 22.8 per cent QoQ to Rs 884.0 crore. A steep decline in profit is expected due to forex losses versus forex gains of Rs 1,430 crore in December 2019 quarter and a decline in margins.\n\nInvestor focus: A strategy to improve work from home (WFH) coverage for BPO work, measures taken to ensure that profitability is higher than FY2020E levels, impact on 5G rollouts from the recent chain of events, demand outlook from the impacted auto vertical, a large deal pipeline, and drivers of revenue in FY2021E.\n\nAnalysts at this brokerage firm expect a decline of about 1.2 per cent in revenues (constant currency, or CC, terms) QoQ, even after incorporating inorganic contribution (cross-currency impact of 40 basis points for the quarter). The revenue decline is due to a ramp-down in the AT&T contract and loss of billing due to impact.\n\nIt expects sales (revenue) in rupee terms to rise 7.8 per cent QoQ to Rs 9,586.1 crore and Ebit at Rs 1,150.3 crore (down 15.9 per cent). Ebit margin is expected to drop 339 bps to 12 per cent, while PAT (profit ater tax) or net profit is seen at Rs 1,046.8 crore, down 7.6 per cent QoQ.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":

On a consolidated basis, the net profit was Rs 315.25 crore.\n\nThe bank’s earnings are not comparable on a yearly basis owing to its merger with Bharat Financial in July, 2019. In Q4FY19, the PAT stood at Rs 360.1 crore.\n\nThe numbers met Street estimates that had anticipated an over 70 per cent QoQ decline in net profit.\n\nAnalysts at Nomura, for instance, had estimated the bank’s PAT to plummet 76 per cent QoQ to Rs 310.6 crore. READ HERE\n\n \n\n The lender, which reported its first quarterly result since its new chief executive officer (CEO) Sumant Kathpalia took over, set aside massive provisions at Rs 2,440 crore. It was a 133.82 per cent jump from Rs 1,043.5 crore provided for in Q3FY20. \n\n\n\nTo cushion against the uncertainties arising due to the outbreak of the (Covid-19) pandemic, the bank has provided for Rs 260 crore under the provisions and contigencies segment.\"The extent to which Covid-19 pandemic will impact the bank's operations and financial results is dependent on the future developments, which are highly uncertain. In this backdrop, during the quarter and year ended March 31 2020, the Bank has made a counter cyclical buffer/ floating provision of Rs 260 crores,\" it said.Besides, in light of the moratorium extended by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with regards to providing relief to borrowers on account of Covid-19 pandemic, the bank has set aside provision of Rs 23 crores during the quarter and year ended March 31, 2020.\n\nThe Mumbai-based private lender’s net interest income (NII) stood at Rs 3,231.2 crore during the recently concluded quarter, up 5.1 per cent from Rs 3,074.02 crore clocked in Q3FY20.\n\nThe bank’s asset quality, too, worsened during the quarter under review. The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) came in at Rs 5,146.74 crore, up from Rs 4,578.43 crore reported in Q3FY20. In terms of ratio, the number rose 27 bps to 2.45 per cent from 2.18 per cent.\n\nOn the other hand, net NPA (NNPA) came in at Rs 1,886.58 crore, compared with Rs 2,173.29 crore in Q3FY20. The ratio came in at 0.91 per cent, down from 1.05 per cent reported in Q3FY20.\n\n \n\n \"During the quarter ended December 31,2019, the bank recognised exposure in respect of two entities with an outstanding of Rs. 960.89 crores as fraud,\" the bank said in a statement, without disclosing the names of the entities. \n\n \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the regulations of the RBI, the bank has charged to the Profit and Loss account an amount of Rs.240.22 crores during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and a total amount of Rs.480.44 crores during the year ended March 31,2020, it added.\n\nAnalysts at ICICI Securities had anticipated the Rs 8,800 crore-exposure to the telecom sector to cast shadow over the bank’s asset quality. That apart, slowdown in the MFI and commercial vehicle (CV) sectors could further aggravate the bank’s non-performing assets (NPA), they had said.\n\nThe counter closed 6 per cent higher at Rs 407.35

Right now, according to the RBI guidelines, only the MSMEs, which are registered under the (GST), are eligible to restructure their loan accounts. This makes only a small number of MSMEs in India eligible for it and the IBA has sought a relief for non- accounts, too,” an official said.\n\nThe RBI had permitted a one-time restructuring of existing loans to GST-registered units. However, the aggregate exposure, including non-fund based facilities, of and non-banking financial firms to such borrowers should not exceed Rs 25 crore, according to RBI guidelines.\n\nALSO READ: Coronavirus impact: 60% firms run at less than 25% capacity, says CII\n\nThe restructuring was allowed till March 31, 2020 but was later on extended by the RBI till December 31, 2020. Around 900,000 MSMEs were eligible for benefit under the restructuring scheme announced by the RBI. Till January 31, 2020, around 619,562 accounts were restructured by the public sector of amount involving Rs 22,650 crore.\n\nThe IBA’s request for a one-time restructuring of all MSME loans come at a time when the ministry is discussing the prospects of giving government guarantee to loans given to small businesses.\n\nThe IBA has further sought relaxation in the RBI’s recent directive to banks, asking them to make additional provisioning of 10 per cent on their books for all moratorium loans.\n\nThe RBI has allowed a three-month moratorium on all term loans, including agriculture, retail and crop loans, along with credit cards and working capital payments, as long as the account didn’t turn into an NPA before March 1. However, on April 17, the RBI asked to make an additional provisioning of 10 per cent for such accounts so that their balance sheets are risk-averse in case of possible losses in the future. Moreover, half of the provisioning requirement has to be made in the quarter ending in March.\n\nALSO READ: Finance Ministry likely to present new GDP, budgetary targets by July\n\nThe IBA has argued that the additional provisioning requirement will have a significant impact on the capital of lenders, impacting their profitability, at a time when they are bracing up to support economic activities, a bank executive said.\n\nAccording to a report by Brickwork Ratings, the RBI’s requirement of additional provisioning may impact the banks’ profitability by Rs 35,000 crore in the March and June quarters if all the stressed accounts in the banking system are given a moratorium on their loans.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB13-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

These two are among the worst hit by Covid-19, reporting over 800,000 cases (as of April 19), according to the data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nDomestic tourist visits numbered 1.8 billion in 2018, a 12% increase from 2017, the tourism ministry’s 2019 report stated. With the lockdown, this, too, came to a standstill. The shutting down of the iconic Taj Mahal on March 17, which attracted over 7 million visitors — both domestic and foreign — in 2018-19, was an evocative symbol of the dramatically altered tourism picture.\n\nThe was in trouble even before the rise of the pandemic, experiencing the impact of the global economic slowdown. The revenue losses in the sector would run into multiple quarters, Pavethra Ponniah, vice president, ICRA, said. “Several hotels have already let go of all contractual labourers. While there are discussions on pay cuts, we are not hearing of permanent labourer cuts yet. A prolonged downcycle could, however, lead to those also being pruned.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Post the lockdown, in the last two weeks the growth rate has come down to 1.2 per cent. “It is a product of how we are managing the situation at the ground level. This decline has happened after we have increased the collection of samples, including those affected with a severe acute respiratory infection,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary,\n\nIndia has so far conducted 3,19,400 tests. Of these, 28,340 tests were conducted on Thursday. India is developing the capacity to manufacture 1 million test kits per month by May and 1 million rapid detection kits too by next month, Aggarwal said.\n\nALSO READ: Tablighi's Faisalabad chief dies of Covid-19 in Pak, 1100 members infected\n\n\n\nThe doubling rate of cases in the country has dropped to 6.2 days over the past week as against three days before the lockdown was imposed.\n\n“The cases will reduce if there is a lockdown, but it should force the government to continue this strategy indefinitely. We should use this time to prepare ourselves to face the increase in infections which is bound to happen when the lockdown is lifted,” said epidemiologist Jayaprakash Muliyil.\n\nIn 19 states and union territories, the doubling rate has been lower than the average including in Delhi, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana and Haryana among others.\n\ndata has also reported that 13 per cent of patients have recovered so far. The outcome ratio, Aggarwal said for cases recovered versus deaths in India shows 20 per cent are dying while 80 per cent are recovering, better than the global average.\n\n \n\n ALSO READ: Maharashtra lockdown: Nearly 50,000 cases filed, 10,000 people held so far\n\nAccording to experts, however, many Covid deaths might not be getting reported or diagnosed in time. “Most economically backward countries are reporting lower deaths due to lack of information systems. Unless an active effort is made to document, Covid deaths that number will not be known accurately,” Muliyil added.\n\nContinuing their research on coronavirus, the Indian Medical Council of Research (ICMR) has found three varieties of and has not found any mutation so far. “The virus does not mutate very fast.

The Naresh Goyal-founded airline, among the first private carriers to take to the skies in 1993, collapsed under a mountain of debt and a cash crunch. It is under insolvency since last June with admitted claims to the tune of Rs 16,000 crore. Now, the Covid-19 crisis has dashed it's revival prospects.\n\nBefore the nationwide lockdown, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) granted an additional three months to the airline's resolution professional to find a suitor on the grounds that lenders would get better value for their assets if these were sold via a formal resolution plan, instead of the liquidation route.\n\nTill last month, the Russian Development Fund and Prudent ARC were in the fray to revive the airline, but did not submit a concrete plan.\n\n“In view of the order passed by the NCLAT in suo moto appeal, the period during which there is a lockdown will be excluded while calculating the period of resolution process,”, said Ashish Pyasi Associate Partner Dhir and Dhir Associates.\n\n“By giving extension, the NCLT gave additional life to the process so that viable resolution plan can be explored. It is pertinent to note that the nature of assets is such that in liquidation these assets may not fetch the same value and may become obsolete. Therefore, for maximisation of asset value it is important that some viable resolution plan is explored,' Pyasi added.\n\nHowever, bankers believe given the current situation, a revival for Jet looks very difficult.\n\n\"Overall aviation industry is in a crisis and airlines have cash flow problem. Expecting a company to submit a revival plan for looks out of question. Even realising good value from liquidation would be difficult as globally airlines are grounding planes,\" said a bank executive.\n\nhas 12 aircraft including three fully owned Boeing 737s, six Boeing 777s and three Airbus A330s including one leased to Air Serbia. In January it decided to sell one of its Boeing 777 aircraft to KLM to settle pending aircraft loan and meet insolvency process costs in the Netherlands but the deal is yet to fructify.\n\nWhile several pilots, engineers and cabin crew have found jobs in other airlines in India and abroad, about 4000 employees are still on the rolls of Jet Airways.\n\n\"It has been difficult for employees to sustain without a regular income. Many have sold their ornaments or broken their fixed deposits to run household. Some have even gone to the native places,\" said Nidhi Chaphekar, Jet's cabin manager turned motivational speaker. Chaphekar and a few of her colleagues are still optimistic about Jet's revival. “The Jet brand is still alive. The aircraft have been preserved. All we are hoping is that government support revival and pay us at least one month salary,\" she added.\n\n“I have exhausted all my savings and my sister is helping me pay my home loan EMIs. In the absence of regular income I have been forced to put up my house in Mumbai for sale and move to Orissa with my children,\" said Geetanjalee Parelkar, a Boeing 777 pilot in the airline.\n\nAs of March 2020, more than 20,000 claims have been made totaling to over Rs 37,000 crore.

All eyes are now on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to announce some relief for the industry on Tuesday.\n\n \n\n\n\nAuto component vendor Nippon Paint India said that at 25 per cent capacity, it will not even meet plant overhead costs, leave alone company overheads. Sharad Malhotra, the company’s president of automotive refinishes and wood coatings, said, “For us to run a viable unit, we need to produce around 60 per cent, and even then, the margins are small. However, once we are allowed to open, we will use it to complete some of our urgent export orders. And, we hope we can move to 100 per cent in a few weeks.” A top executive of a leading passenger car company in north India also agreed that producing cars with such limitation would be a challenging.\n\n \n\n\n\nCement manufacturers like Shree Cement would prefer to wait and watch rather than rush in. H M Bangur, managing director of Shree Cement, who prefers to wait for a week before he takes a decision to open his plant, said, “There are two issues – demand for cement is not there as construction is put on hold and all expenses of capex are getting deferred. Secondly, there is a big issue on logistics.”\n\n\n\nBangur added that workers are unwilling to come to the factory. So, he will wait before taking a final call.\n\n\n\nMobile device manufacturers are in sync with the government plan for staggered production. Hari Om Rai, director of Lava Mobiles, one of the leading Indian manufacturers, said, “The 25 per cent utilisation of capacity is fine with us. It will also help us in gauging the demand for mobile phones from consumers which I believe will also go up gradually.” So, instead of about 3,500 workers, Lava would initially run its factory with 600-700 staff, which is the minimum threshold required for production.\n\n \n\n\n\nALSO READ: LIVE: Coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than swine flu, says WHO\n\nGarment exporters in Tirupur, who were asking the government to allow them to open their units with even a tenth of workers, are relieved. They feared that if they could not send samples to their clients, they would lose out to China and Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n“Stores in the UK, EU and the US have been asking exporters for samples, to give approvals and place orders. At this moment, it is important for us to open the knitting, dyeing, compacting and calendaring units. The 25 per cent capacity limit is enough for us to address the samples and tackle fear psychosis,” said Raja M Shanmugam, president of the Tirupur Exporters Association.\n\n\n\nThermax, for instance, has already restarted its chemical factories as they were supplying to essential services like FMCG but with one shift instead of the normal three.\n\n\n\nM S Unnikrishnan, managing director of the company, said, “For our equipment manufacturing units, which are in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, even if the lockdown is lifted, we will restart operations gradually. We need to put in safety measures.”", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB3-5", "parent":
