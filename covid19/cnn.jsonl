{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 897364, "name": "Anneken Tappe"}, "body": "Initial jobless claims soared to a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million in the week ended March 21, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nThat is the highest number of initial jobless claims in history, since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967. The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in the week ending October 2, 1982.\n\n\"Most historical comparisons of this scale are inadequate.The closest would be natural disasters like major hurricanes. However, as today's report shows, the coronavirus outbreak is economically akin to a major hurricane occurring in every state around the country for weeks on end,\" Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao wrote in emailed comments.\n\nLast week's jump marked a massive increase from a revised 282,000 claims in the prior week. Prior to the pandemic, initial claims had been hovering in the low 200,000s each week, reflecting a strong job market.\n\nBut in the last couple weeks, the coronavirus outbreak has forced many businesses to suddenly shut down as the country tries to slow the spreading virus. For many businesses that also means laying off or furloughing workers, at least temporarily. That is the key difference between the coronavirus shock compared with past periods of economic distress: it is sudden and impacts virtually every industry and business model around. As a result, economists are expecting millions of job losses in the coming weeks. Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist for the US Department of Labor who is now with the Economic Policy Institute, called the surge in unemployment claims just the tip of the iceberg. \"We estimate that by summer, 14 million workers will lost their jobs due to the coronavirus shock,\" she said in a tweet Economists now expect the US economy to fall into a recession in the second quarter, before staging a comeback later in the year after the spread of the virus slows. Meanwhile, state labor departments across the country are have struggled to deal with the sudden influx in claims for unemployment benefits. The New York Labor Department, for example, has added server capacity and hired more than 65 additional staff to handle all the claims that are suddenly pouring in. And last week, Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity said it planned to hire 100 extra staff to help answer calls and walk people through the application process. Speaking later on Thursday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin downplayed last week's surge in unemployment claims in an interview with CNBC, calling the numbers \"not relevant\" because they pre-dated an economic relief bill passed by Congress on Wednesday . That bill includes support for workers, including checks from the government and expanded unemployment benefits. He added businesses \"hopefully will be able to hire back a lot of those people.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB4-11", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

I think we should be thinking about that right now. The idea of holding the convention is going to be necessary. We may not be able to put 10, 20, 30,000 people in one place,\" he said in an interview Sunday morning with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nBiden added that how the convention is held depends on whether the public health threat of the coronavirus has been mitigated by that time. \"Again let's see where it is,\" the former vice president said. \"And what we do between now and then is going to dictate a lot of that as well. But my point is that I think you just got to follow the science.\"\n\nThe comments from the party's front-runner for the nomination come a day after the Democratic National Committee announced its decision to postpone the convention. Biden currently holds a sizable delegate lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the nomination fight. Both campaigns supported the decision to move the convention, a Democratic official told CNN.\n\nCNN previously reported that representatives for the Biden and Sanders campaigns were consulted on the decision to move the Democratic National Convention from July to August, per two Democratic officials. Democrats had initially picked the mid-July date as a way to hold their convention before the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. But when the Olympics were delayed by a year due to the coronavirus, the three weeks spanning July and August were open for what Democrats hope will be a major media moment. The Democratic convention will now happen the week immediately before the Republican convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the delay in the convention also puts off any consideration of changing the convention rules to allow delegates to cast their votes remotely. Current convention rules dictate that delegates have to appear in person to nominate a candidate, so a rule change would be needed in order to allow votes to be cast digitally.", "categories":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 955799, "name": "Joshua Berlinger"}, "body": "A crew member aboard the Celebrity Infinity, part of Miami-based Royal Caribbean, told CNN that one crew member died on board the ship last week.\n\nThe announcement of the death came over the PA system and in a memorial service on the ship TV channel, according to Port and Shopping Guide Julia Melim. Royal Caribbean has confirmed the death to CNN, but will not confirm its cause. There are no passengers on the ship. Melim says she is one of more than 900 crew, who are stuck off the coast of Tampa.\n\nMelim told CNN that it wasn't until March 28, after 14 days at sea, that Celebrity Infinity mandated that everyone on board the crew-only vessel be quarantined in their cabin with meals delivered to their doors.\n\nReferring to Covid-19, Royal Caribbean spokesman Jonathon Fishman said: \"When we were first notified on March 23 of a positive test result, we took immediate action to implement enhanced, precautionary health measures, medical monitoring, and ship sanitization protocols for the protection of our crew’s health in accordance with guidance by public health officials.”\n\nCNN asked Fishman a series of direct questions about Melim’s allegations, including how it wasn’t until March 28 that crew were confined to their cabins. Fishman responded:\n\nOn March 23, the ship sent out a memo to crew members who were on the Celebrity Infinity from March 9 through 14, alerting them that a crew member who sailed on the ship during that time tested positive for Covid-19. It said they could have been exposed to the illness. The memo outlined steps for temperature checks twice a day and said to avoid contact with others.\n\nBut Melim alleges that Celebrity Infinity crew members were encouraged to participate in social events, from March 14, when the ship dropped off passengers at the Port of Miami, until March 23.\n\n“We had like crew parties, we had live music, we had concerts, movie nights, theater performances,\" alleges Melim. At one point she said hundreds of people congregated at the ship's auditorium. And even after March 23, Melim says the ship still required the crew to get buffet-style meals in a dining area full of people and had them walk through the ship for daily temperature checks.\n\nMelim says she tried to raise concerns verbally with her colleagues at meetings about the need to social distance, but she says she was immediately shut down.\n\n“They made me feel I was crazy to even bring it up. Anytime anyone raised a question, it was the general response: the ship is the safest place to be,\" she said.\n\nMelim says it wasn’t until the ship was anchored at sea and had no other option other than stay on the ship, that on March 27 the Celebrity Infinity first started revealing there were people with “flu-like symptoms consistent with Covid-19 onboard the ship,” Melim told CNN.\n\n“And they said there were no confirmed cases, but they didn’t have any test kits onboard. So there is really no way they could have had a confirmed case,” she said.\n\nCNN has seen a memo sent by the doctor on the Celebrity Infinity to the ship and managers on board on March 25, saying in part: “As we have seen how quickly this virus has spread around the world, I think we need to increase our public health measures around the ship. We need to start increasing our social distancing from each other before it is too late.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-12", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1251012, "name": "Tami Luhby"}, "body": "That's how long Camilla Christiansen Poole waited on hold with the North Carolina Division of Employment Security, trying to find out why she could not file for unemployment online\n\nThe Asheville, North Carolina, resident had been laid off from her job as a medical courier on March 24 -- one of a record number of people left without work because of the coronavirus crisis. She called the division dozens of times, only to be disconnected. But finally, on Monday, she was placed on hold.\n\n\"I pretty much was sitting still, besides walking my dogs,\" said Poole, who was prepared to stay on the line through the night. \"I was so scared. I knew it was probably a blessing that I had been looped into being on hold. I was really surprised when someone finally answered.\"\n\nYet while Poole is among the millions of economic victims of the pandemic, she is not one of the nearly 10 million Americans who filed for first-time unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of March -- because, like countless others, she hasn't been able to complete her application and be approved.\n\nCongress is funneling $1 billion in stimulus funds to states to help them handle the unprecedented workload. The money can't come soon enough since most state agencies are dealing with antiquated technology and smaller staffs due to recent low unemployment rates.\n\nUnable to get through\n\nWhen Poole finally got hold of a representative, she was told to upload two forms of identification, which she quickly did. But she has yet to be approved for unemployment benefits. Poole, who is married, has called dozens of times this week but has not been able to get through again.\n\n\"It's just highlighting how ill-prepared we were,\" said Poole, 43, who is talking to the couple's bank about possibly deferring their mortgage payment next month. \"It's super frustrating.\"\n\nThe agency said Friday that it is \"moving aggressively\" to better address the unprecedented spike in filings by hiring 50 more staffers, contracting with an additional 200-person call center, adding computer servers and purchasing new equipment.\n\nAbout 370,000 North Carolinians have filed for benefits since March 16, compared to 3,000 in a typical week before the pandemic hit.\n\nIn San Antonio, Texas, Liam Apperley put the state Workforce Commission on speed dial after being furloughed from his sales and training job at a corporate development company on March 16.\n\nApperley had called 5,257 times by midday Thursday -- he checked his cellphone account -- but would either get a busy signal, a message that all circuits were busy or an automated recording to hold the line, only to be disconnected or get a voicemail saying the agency was overwhelmed by calls. On Friday, he tried calling a minute before the office opened at 8 a.m., but got a message that it was closed. After that, all he heard were busy signals.\n\nMore than half a million Texans have filed for claims in the last 18 days, the commission said Friday. The number will soon outpace the total received in all of 2019. The agency recommended that residents stagger the days they file by the first digit of their area code to ease the crunch.\n\nApperley, 48, who is the main breadwinner for his family and has had to start drawing down his savings, would prefer the commission set up a system to take residents' contact information and return their call at a certain time, much like many companies do.\n\n\"Even if I were to get (a message) from Texas Workforce that said we'll call you back in three or four days, at least I'd know there's some light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said.", "categories":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 971851, "name": "Eric Levenson"}, "body": "(CNN) Given the dangers doctors face on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Matthew Bai and his wife made a difficult decision over the weekend.\n\n\"My wife and I decided that it would be safer for our family, for our 17-month-old daughter and my wife, to leave our apartment until this is over, since I'm in and out of this high-risk environment everyday,\" he said to the camera while sitting in his car. \"I don't know how long it's gonna be, but this morning when I left the house and said goodbye to my wife and my daughter for who knows how long. It's gonna be several weeks probably before I see them in person again.\"\n\nBai, an attending physician in the emergency department at Mt. Sinai Queens hospital, spoke about his difficult decision as part of a video diary documenting his day in the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew York has been the hardest hit state in the U.S. with over 84,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 2,200 deaths. The surge in cases has threatened to overwhelm the health care system, and doctors have warned they are running low on space, ventilators and supplies.\n\n\"You can see all the rooms are filled,\" Bai said as he navigated around patient beds in the hallways. \"Usually these halls are very neat and empty. And now you can see, there's patients everywhere because of this. It makes it very hard to work, and we're trying our best to treat everyone we can.\"\n\n\"All these patients here, sitting out in the hallways because we are full. All these patients in the hallway have all been seen, even though we're overflowing -- (we're) trying our best to still provide them care, which we are doing. You can see here that the patients have oxygen tanks that they need.\"\n\nBai knew it would be a difficult day from the start. The night earlier, he said, there were over 60 patients waiting for a hospital bed with Covid-19.\n\n\"I don't know what this morning's gonna be like, but it's probably not gonna be that much different from last night, meaning it's gonna be a busy day. It's been tough,\" he said.\n\nAfter arriving to the hospital, he put on layers of PPE that generally stay on for the entire day, including an N95 mask, a surgical mask on top of that, and eye protection.\n\n\"If I need to go into a high-risk procedure, like intubating a patient, meaning putting a patient on a ventilator, we have full face masks that cover the entire area and all your equipment,\" he said. \"And after you're done with the procedure, that comes off, and we wipe that down and disinfect it for the next use .\"\n\nHis shift was supposed to end at 5 p.m., but he said he stayed until about 7 to finish taking care of patients. Bai, red-nosed from the tight fit of his PPE, admitted it was a tough day.\n\n\"The (Emergency Department) has been really full and everyone's trying their best to give everyone the treatment that they need. I mean I'm— I'm tired. I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna try to sleep, and then we'll be back tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"I want to say that, I mean, the things that I see in the ER are scary. I'm a little scared myself. But it's good to see all these people coming in from all over, from other services in the hospital, from other areas in the nation stepping in to help out.\n\n\"So, it's not gonna be easy. I mean it's gonna be really tough and it's only gonna get tougher over the next two weeks,\" Bai said. \"But we'll get through this as best as we can, and we'll try to use the resources that we have, as best as we can to help as many people as we can.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7", "parent": null}, "score": 0.14, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-23", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7-23", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7"}, "score": 0.05, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "07001000", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/07001000", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/07000000"}, "score": 0.1, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 3504, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[2096, 2098], [2691, 2693]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy,_Politics_and_Economics"}, "score": 0.6237063407897949, "text": "PPE", "types": ["University", "Degree", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[698, 702]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinai_Peninsula"}, "score": 0.9894645810127258, "text": "Sinai", "types": ["Place", "Settlement", "Peninsula"]}, {"indices": [[704, 709]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queens"}, "score": 0.999532163143158, "text": "Queens", "types": ["Settlement", "Location", "Place", "PopulatedPlace", "City"]}, {"indices": [[1682, 1687]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxygen"}, "score": 0.9997854828834534, "text": "oxygen", "types": ["MilitaryUnit", "Element", "RecordLabel"]}, {"indices": [[1, 3]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNN"}, "score": 0.9998345971107483, "text": "CNN", "types": ["Cable", "Agent", "TelevisionStation", "Broadcaster", "Channel", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[680, 689]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France"}, "score": 0.9988808631896973, "text": "department", "types": ["SportsLeague", "Levels"]}, {"indices": [[2202, 2215]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eye_protection"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "eye protection", "types": ["Aircraft", "Product", "Gear"]}, {"indices": [[2917, 2921]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sleep"}, "score": 0.9993361830711365, "text": "sleep", "types": ["Band"]}, {"indices": [[831, 838]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_(state)"}, "score": 0.6989675760269165, "text": "New York", "types": ["Region", "AdministrativeRegion", "Settlement", "Location", "Place", "PopulatedPlace"]}, {"indices": [[769, 779]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vlog"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "video diary", "types": ["MusicGenre"]}, {"indices": [[2322, 2331]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_ventilator"}, "score": 0.8710513114929199, "text": "ventilator", "types": ["Machine", "Software", "Product"]}, {"indices": [[643, 661]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attending_physician"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "attending physician", "types": ["Physician", "Person", "PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[2732, 2751]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emergency_department"}, "score": 0.9907388091087341, "text": "Emergency Department", "types": ["ArchitecturalStructure", "Facility", "PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[711, 718], [1836, 1843], [2066, 2073], [3158, 3165]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital"}, "score": 0.9999330639839172, "text": "hospital", "types": ["University", "PersonFunction", "Institution"]}, {"indices": [[74, 81], [820, 827]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandemic"}, "score": 0.9949770569801331, "text": "pandemic", "types": ["Epidemic", "Arachnid"]}, {"indices": [[3026, 3027]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/ER_(TV_series)"}, "score": 0.9399012327194214, "text": "ER", "types": ["TelevisionShow", "Product", "Series", "Work"]}, {"indices": [[62, 72], [808, 818], [910, 920]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "coronavirus", "types": ["Species", "Eukaryote"]}, {"indices": [[1007, 1024]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_system"}, "score": 0.9862134456634521, "text": "health care system", "types": ["Organization", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[694, 709]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Mt.

The virus infected two-thirds of residents and dozens of staff members.\n\nWhile more evidence shows young adults can become seriously ill from coronavirus, the elderly and those with underlying conditions are the most vulnerable to dying from the virus. Other serious issues identified by inspectors were a failure to \"ensure timely notification of public health authorities\" and to make available \"emergency physician services 24 hours a day during the outbreak crisis.\" \"By not acting timely and implementing a facility plan created an environment that placed new admissions and other residents at risk for harm and death,\" the inspection report said. Inspectors re-visited the facility on March 29 and found that, while the \"immediate jeopardy\" problems were fixed, \"substantial noncompliance\" still remained. Officials at the home said CMS has been a valued partner. \"We are working hard to address their current concerns in a timely and respectful manner so as to provide our residents the best care,\" officials said in a statement. The center also faces the loss of its Medicare and Medicaid funding if it does not correct the problems. \"We will continue to work with CMS to find solutions to their ongoing concerns,\" Life Care Center's statement said. The nursing home now has until September 16 to \"correct all deficiencies and return to full compliance\" before CMS bars the facility from participating in the Medicare/Medicaid program, says a letter sent by the federal agency to the facility Wednesday. These are the faces of some of the US coronavirus victims Additionally, the agency has levied a per-day civil penalty of $13,585 for the deficiencies starting on February 12 and continuing through March 27, for a total of $611,325, the letter says.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 963061, "name": "Tara Subramaniam"}, "body": "Atlanta (CNN) Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said on Wednesday that new information on the spread of coronavirus influenced his decision to issue a stay-at-home order . In particular, Kemp pointed to what he said was the recent discovery that the virus can be spread by people who are not exhibiting symptoms.\n\n\"What we've been telling people from directives from the CDC for weeks now that if you start feeling bad stay home, those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad. But we didn't know that until the last 24 hours,\" said Kemp, a Republican.\n\nFacts First: It's not true that people didn't know \"until the last 24 hours\" that individuals without symptoms could be infecting people with coronavirus. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said in mid-February that asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus was possible. Furthermore, studies from as early as January showed cases of coronavirus spreading amongst people with no symptoms.\n\nKemp's press secretary said the governor was referring to an update that the CDC made to its guidance on March 30 that indicated there's a higher risk of people without symptoms passing on the virus. The updated guidance changed the period of exposure risk for individuals from \"onset of symptoms\" to \"48 hours before symptom onset.\"\n\nAs more has been learned about the virus, several experts told CNN last month that it's become clear that transmission by people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic is responsible for more transmission than previously thought.\n\nThough it wasn't the first time he acknowledged it, Redfield confirmed that suspicion in a March 30 interview with NPR affiliate WABE, in which he said \"as many as 25%\" of individuals who are infected with coronavirus may remain asymptomatic. \"One of the [pieces of] information that we have pretty much confirmed now is that a significant number of individuals that are infected actually remain asymptomatic,\" Redfield said.\n\n\"There's been good communication with our colleagues to confirm asymptomatic infection, to confirm asymptomatic transmission, to be able to get a better handle on the clinical spectrum of illness in China,\" Redfield said. \"What we don't know though is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving transmission.\"\n\nThe potential for asymptomatic transmission is something that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, first raised two months ago.\n\nIn late January, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, told CNN , \"There's no doubt after reading this paper that asymptomatic transmission is occurring.\" The paper Fauci referenced is a study published on January 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nPublic health experts have since said the January study was flawed , because a patient who was said to be asymptomatic actually had mild symptoms. Yet the latest update to the CDC site also cites several studies from February and March documenting coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The CDC guidance clarifies that \"although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons has been reported, risk of transmission is thought to be greatest when patients are symptomatic.\"\n\n\"Until you really understand how many people are asymptomatic and asymptomatically passing the virus on, we think it's better for the entire American public to know that the risk of serious illness may be low,\" Birx said, \"but they could be potentially spreading the virus to others.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

He received a reduced sentence after cooperating with federal investigators and informing on his former gang associates, and is expected to be released on July 31, according to his attorney.\n\nJudge says he would have sentenced home confinement Lazzaro filed a letter in federal court on March 22 asking that his client be released to avoid the risk of contracting Covid-19. Lazzaro reiterated in another letter on March 31 that Hernandez has \"severe asthma and was recently hospitalized for bronchitis,\" making him vulnerable to the coronavirus. Engelmayer denied the request, stating he did not have the authority to grant the request. Hernandez, the judge said, should instead seek compassionate release from the Bureau of Prisons. But the judge also indicated the sentence would have been different if he had known of the coming pandemic and the threat it posed to people with asthma, like Hernandez. If coronavirus sounds bad to you, imagine how these people feel \"Had the court known that sentencing Mr. Hernandez to serve the final four months of his term in a federal prison would have exposed him to a heightened health risk,\" Engelmayer wrote in the order, \"the Court would have directed that these four months be served instead in home confinement.\" But the BOP also denied the request because Hernandez is not in its custody. He is technically in the care of the US Marshals Service in a private prison. So Lazzaro went back to the judge, arguing Engelmayer did, in fact, have the authority to order Hernandez's release -- a claim backed by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Hernandez's case. US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman wrote in a letter to Engelmayer that the Court would have the authority to reduce the sentence if it found \"extraordinary and compelling reasons\" related to the defendant's health, citing federal law. Additionally, Berman wrote the government \"does not oppose\" a compassionate release for Hernandez. Lazzaro told CNN he expects Engelmayer to make a final decision on Hernandez on Thursday or Friday.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-5", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11"}, "score": 0.24, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "IAB11", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11", "parent": null}, "score": 0.13, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "02008000", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/02008000", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/02000000"}, "score": 0.43, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 2517, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[57, 64], [617, 624]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawyer"}, "score": 0.9653107523918152, "text": "attorney", "types": ["Person", "PersonFunction"]}, {"indices": [[2279, 2287]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defendant"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "defendant", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[1120, 1140], [2381, 2401]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compassionate_release"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "compassionate release", "types": ["Process", "Election"]}, {"indices": [[85, 87], [2431, 2433]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNN"}, "score": 0.9998446702957153, "text": "CNN", "types": ["Cable", "Channel", "TelevisionStation", "Broadcaster", "Agent", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[1810, 1828]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Marshals_Service"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "US Marshals Service", "types": ["S", "PersonFunction", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[886, 891], [1316, 1321]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asthma"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "asthma", "types": ["Disease"]}, {"indices": [[149, 156], [426, 433], [2042, 2049]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_(state)"}, "score": 0.7286650538444519, "text": "New York", "types": ["PopulatedPlace", "Place", "Settlement", "Location", "AdministrativeRegion", "Region"]}, {"indices": [[927, 936]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronchitis"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "bronchitis", "types": ["Disease", "Inflammation"]}, {"indices": [[1835, 1848]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Private_prison"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "private prison", "types": ["Place", "Settlement"]}, {"indices": [[1268, 1275]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandemic"}, "score": 0.994260311126709, "text": "pandemic", "types": ["Arachnid", "Epidemic"]}, {"indices": [[331, 341], [969, 979], [1343, 1353]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "coronavirus", "types": ["Eukaryote", "Species"]}, {"indices": [[149, 165]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "New York District", "types": ["Place"]}, {"indices": [[1810, 1811], [1992, 1993], [2087, 2088]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "US", "types": ["Place"]}, {"indices": [[178, 187], [982, 991], [1571, 1580], [1894, 1903], [2139, 2148], [2446, 2455]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Engelmayer", "types": ["Place", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[66, 78]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Lance Lazzaro", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[173, 187]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Paul Engelmayer", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[236, 250]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Tekashi 6ix9ine", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[267, 282]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Daniel Hernandez", "types": ["Person"]}, {"indices": [[274, 282], [864, 872], [1073, 1081], [1329, 1337], [1445, 1453], [1740, 1748], [1947, 1955], [2069, 2077], [2407, 2415], [2485, 2493]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Hernandez", "types": ["Person", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[2099, 2116]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "Geoffrey S.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 980039, "name": "Manu Raju"}, "body": "Americans likely won't begin to see direct payments from the coronavirus stimulus bill until at least April 13 and it could take 20 weeks for all the checks to be mailed, Trump administration officials told lawmakers, according to a House Democratic memo obtained by CNN.\n\nThe timeline means tens of millions of Americans will have to wait to get badly needed assistance, despite repeated suggestions from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the money would go out as soon as April 6. He said this past Sunday after passage of the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that payments would not go out until mid-April.\n\nCNN reported in March that former IRS officials said the wait would likely be weeks or months.\n\nInitially, the IRS will make about 60 million payments, likely in the week of April 13, for taxpayers who provided their direct deposit information through their 2018 or 2019 tax returns, the memo from the House Ways and Means Committee says.\n\nThree weeks later, on the week of May 4, the IRS expects to start issuing paper checks to individuals whose bank information isn't already on file, a process that will take much longer.\n\nWhen will you get your stimulus cash, and how? According to the committee, the paper checks will be issued at a rate of about 5 million per week, and that it could take up to 20 weeks to issue all the checks. Individuals with the lowest income, based on adjusted gross income, will receive their checks first. The Ways and Means Committee memo detailed its understanding of the timeline based on \"extensive\" conversations with Treasury and IRS officials. It said that the timelines are subject to change. The law stipulates that individuals who earn $75,000 or less will receive $1,200, and couples making $150,000 or less will receive twice that amount, with an additional $500 per child. The payments decrease for individuals and couples who make more money, with individuals who make more than $99,000 receiving nothing. Congressional aides were told last week when they were briefed by the IRS that roughly 150 million taxpayers will be eligible for the payments, but of those the IRS estimated they only had about 70 million people's direct deposit information on file. That means for roughly 80 million Americans, the IRS will have to rely on mailing checks. \"The Bureau of Fiscal Service estimates they can cut 20 million checks a month,\" a source familiar told CNN.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 944573, "name": "Veronica Stracqualursi"}, "body": "More than 2,000 ventilators, a key piece of equipment to treat coronavirus patients, in the federal stockpile are unavailable to be deployed because the Trump administration failed to maintain the devices as they were in storage, according to The New York Times.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that the federal government is withholding 10,000 ventilators from distribution because of an anticipated surge in Covid-19 cases. But an additional 2,109 ventilators are out of commission because maintenance of the devices was halted during a contracting dispute, the Times reported Wednesday.\n\nStates are scrambling for ventilators and requesting thousands of the devices from the federal government, only to receive a few hundred. Trump has insisted that states are requesting more ventilators than they need.\n\nWhen its contract with Vyaire Medical to maintain some of the stockpile ventilators expired at the end of August, the government awarded a broader contract to Agiliti, according to the Times.\n\nThat led Vyaire Medical to protest the decision and the contract dispute was not resolved until January, the Times reported.\n\nDuring that roughly five-month period, maintenance on the machines halted, according to the newspaper. \"We were given a stop-work order before we'd even started,\" Agiliti's chief executive, Tom Leonard, told the Times. Experts say ventilators cannot be stored for long periods without upkeep, the Times noted. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday the state had received 170 broken ventilators from the federal government. The Department of Health and Human Services told the Times that the issues with some of the deployed ventilators were limited to their external batteries and that federal officials were quick to help the states with technical issues. Even after its contract expired, Vyaire Medical was still receiving thousands of ventilators for restoration — work that is still ongoing, according to the Times. Vyaire Medical's vice president of US sales, Aric Vacchiano, told the Times that the company has been fielding calls as hospitals hurry to get the ventilators working again. \"We're not hearing or seeing units showing up being truly or fundamentally broken,\" Vacchiano told the Times, adding that \"they probably have not been maintained.\" Agiliti began maintaining the ventilators in late January, when it started becoming clear that coronavirus was a global threat, according to the newspaper. Leonard told the Times that Agiliti was not responsible for the faults in the ventilators. \"Between the time of the original and the time of this contract award, I don't know who was responsible or if anybody was responsible for those devices. But it was not us,\" he told the paper. Without giving a specific number due to its confidentiality agreement with the government, Leonard told the Times that the company still has \"that first tranche of ventilators, although we're accelerating the work to get them deployable.\" \"We haven't seen or touched or had anything to do with the ones that have already been deployed to date,\" he added. An HHS spokeswoman did not reply to the Times' questions about what had occurred to the ventilator maintenance during the contract lapse. She told the Times, however, that the agency had accelerated the contract with Agiliti to make the 2,109 ventilators available by April 30.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3",

Everybody is taking risks trying to do it. He bailed out, man. It's pretty hard to explain, but he bailed out, man.\"\n\n\"The guys that are really doing it are the doctors and the nurses and the people taking care of everybody. If we can do our little bit of part to try and make something happen, I'm down with that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a number of other fighters have thrust themselves forward as potential opponents for Ferguson.\n\nCNN have reached out to the UFC for a response.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-20", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

He also extended the state's tax filing deadline to July 15.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, New York had at least 728 reported deaths due to coronavirus and at least 52,318 reported cases, making it the state with the most reported cases in the US, according to CNN Health's tally.\n\nThe US surpassed Italy and China this week to become the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world with more than 102,963 known cases, according to CNN's tally. At least 1,590 people have died in the US.\n\nMore than a third of the country's cases are in New York -- which has been in a partial lockdown for a week as officials try to slow the spread of the virus and hospitals scramble to keep up with the patients streaming in. The rate of new cases may be slowing in New York, but Cuomo has said it may take 21 days for the state to hit its peak and begin going down. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he is thinking about a possible \"short-term, two week\" quarantine for \"New York, probably New Jersey and certain parts of Connecticut.\" Speaking at the White House, Trump said, \"We might not have to do it, but there's a possibility sometime today\" he will enact a quarantine.\" Asked about Trump's possible quarantine comments at Saturday's news conference, Cuomo said he and the President had not talked about it. The governor went on to say he didn't know what such a quarantine would mean. \"I spoke to the President about the ship coming up and the four sites. I didn't speak to him about any quarantine,\" Cuomo said. Trump said on the White House South Lawn that he had spoken with Cuomo Saturday, but then at Joint Base Andrews the President said, \"I'll speak to the governor about it later,\" referring to the quarantine. The Democratic National Committee said in a statement that its Rules and Bylaws Committee would consider how to move forward with states like New York that have moved primaries beyond June 9. \"As states continue to deal with the unknown of COVID-19, it is critical that we ensure the safety and well-being of all Americans, as well as protect and expand every American's right to vote. That is why we encourage all remaining states to implement critical tools like vote by mail and other critical reforms to make it easier to vote,\" said DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa in a statement. \"We will continue to monitor the situation and work with state parties around their delegate selection plans, and if states move beyond the June 9th window stated in our rules, the Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to discuss and determine next steps.\" This story has been updated with additional developments.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1496987, "name": "Matt Rivers"}, "body": "During his remarks, which broadcast live on YouTube and Facebook, Gov. Luis Miguel Barbosa posed a question, asking reporters which people were infected at the moment.\n\n\"The majority are wealthy people, you know,\" he said, answering his own question. \"If you're rich you're at risk, but if you're poor, no, well us poor, we are immune.\"\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest the virus effects people differently due to economic status. His remarks sparked an uproar on social media, with many questioning why a government official would spread information that has no basis in fact.\n\nBarbosa noted that many of those who contracted the virus had recently traveled, suggesting a link between wealth and travel. Of Mexico's 475 confirmed cases so far, about 75% were connected to international travel, according to federal health statistics. As of Thursday afternoon, 44 people had tested positive for the virus in Puebla.\n\nWhy are these three presidents downplaying coronavirus warnings? Asked about the remarks at a Thursday press conference, Barbosa refused to comment. Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has also drawn criticism recently for what critics call his dismissive attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak. As the pandemic spread across the world, as recently as last week López Obrador was not practicing social distancing and downplaying the virus' threat, telling families to live as they normally would. He has changed his tone over the last few days, as Mexico's case count has more than doubled since March 20, urging people to be safe and stay home. Mexico's federal government has ramped up prevention measures recently. Beginning what it calls phase 2 of its crisis response, the government has shuttered schools, closed nonessential federal offices and encouraged people to say home and socially distance. A nightly press conference by the Ministry of Health updates the public on the status of the outbreak. On Thursday morning, López Obrador told reporters the worst of the outbreak would be over by April 19. But Deputy Health Secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell Ramírez told reporters shortly afterward that there is a strong risk that the number of cases will exponentially rise, forcing the government to take stronger preventative measures. Gov. Barbosa is a member of López Obrador's MORENA political party. His comments are also at odds with preventative measures recently put in place in Puebla -- measures that are not only aimed at the wealthy: On March 23, Puebla's government temporarily suspended all activities at theaters, cinemas, gyms, bars and zoos, among other places. The local government has also launched an online hygiene campaign, including videos in Nahuatl, an indigenous language spoken by more than a million people nationwide.", "categories": [{"confident":

The items are his personal protective equipment, or PPE -- improvised due to the severe shortage at hospitals across the city -- and he'll likely need to use them at work tomorrow.\n\nAs a per diem emergentologist who fills in shifts left empty by the increasing number of doctors calling out sick, Sun has the unique perspective of working in emergency rooms throughout the New York City area. Within the walls of each medical facility , he sees the same desperation.\n\nSun, a native New Yorker, documented his journey for CNN over the course of one week.\n\n\"We don't have enough N95 masks. Some have run out completely. Some don't even have gowns,\" he said. \"You can put me in the exact same ER and I would witness the exact same evolution of chaos.\"\n\n\"In my particular emergency department, we have an area cordoned off for the Covid-positive patients and the presumptive positive patients, but because of a lack of space, they're all housed together, which is a big problem for infection control,\" said Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, president of the New York State Nurses Association.\n\n\"I can speak on behalf of all my fellow colleagues in this fight that you're never really sure what's going to happen in the future, especially when it takes about five to eight days for you to catch it and develop symptoms,\" he said. \"And we can't really test unless you have symptoms, given the lack of testing kits and (PPE) provided for us by the higher-ups.\"\n\n\"Testing is so necessary to contain this spread. We need to screen everyone, but also, it's not about what you do but how you do it,\" Sun said. \"Because let's say you didn't have Covid-19. And then you come to the emergency room to get a test, and then we test you. It's gonna be negative, right.\n\n\"And then, a person sitting next to you coughs in your face because you're in the emergency room. And then two to three days later, you get a phone call on that test you got two or three days ago. It's negative. Then, you hug grandma, and then grandma gets Covid-19. And then two to three weeks later, I'm putting her on life support. That's on you, right? It doesn't make sense to come to an emergency room because of the risk of cross-contamination.\"\n\nOnly those who cannot speak a full sentence without losing their breath should head to the ER, Sun said. Otherwise, monitor symptoms from home.\n\nAfter finishing a 10-hour shift at 2 a.m. on March 27, an exhausted Sun caught a ride-share home and reflected upon another intense night.\n\n\"Today was just a sign that things are getting worse and worse. I had about three deaths in the span of the first six hours, he said. \"One was truly sad. (He) waited a few days for a bed, and it was too full upstairs so he stayed in the ER, and from Covid-19, he just lost his pulses. We worked on him for an hour, and then he died.\"\n\nDespite the tremendous obstacles ahead, Sun is committed to the oath he took as a physician to care for the sick.\n\n\"This is still New York, and the lights are still on,\" he said as he looked out the window on the ride home. \"That's a sign that things are going to keep on going, if we keep on fighting.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true,

Born on March 5, 1907, he was 112 years and 355 days old.\n\nIt is usually customary for adjudicators to meet with record holders in person. However, due to global social distancing measures that have been applied because of the coronavirus pandemic, Weighton was awarded his certificate remotely, at the assisted living home where he lives.\n\nPlaying down the accolade, Weighton described himself as \"an ordinary bloke who just happened to live for a long time.\"\n\nIn a video clip posted on the GWR site, he said: \"I have never been someone who said 'I want to climb Everest' or sail around the world... I just take life as it comes along.\"\n\nBorn in Kingston-Upon-Hull in Yorkshire, he was one of seven children. After leaving school at 16, he undertook a marine engineering apprenticeship. He later moved to Taiwan where he spent two years learning Mandarin and taught at a missionary school.\n\nIn 1937 he married his wife Agnes, who was also a teacher. Their first child was born in Taiwan, but two years later they left for the UK.\n\nTheir timing clashed with the outbreak of World War II, and the family was diverted to Canada.\n\nDuring the war, the family moved from Canada to Connecticut in the US. While there, Weighton worked in a factory making planes to support Britain's war efforts.\n\nThe couple had two more children during this time and remained in the US until 1945, when they then returned to the UK.\n\nWeighton later went on to teach at London's City University. His wife Agnes passed away in 1995.\n\nThe grandfather of 10 and great-grandfather of 25 said: \"When you're young you don't think about being old. It's a new record for me. The only other record I remember ever having was jumping five feet two inches high in my school days in the final high jump on sports day.\"\n\nWeighton has more than four years to go until he beats the record of the longest ever living man. That accolade goes to Jiroemon Kimura from Japan, who was born on April 19, 1897 and died aged 116 years and 54 days on June 12, 2013.\n\nKane Tanaka, the world's oldest woman, lives in Japan.

My Hong Kong apartment (and many other reporters apartments I might add!) made a guest appearance during the Q&A session #huawei #COVID19 #business #news pic.twitter.com/aYoTm4SFev\n\nWhile the severe restrictions on travel and work have been lifted, daily office life has changed substantially.\n\nOver at Huawei headquarters, wining and dining clients is now impossible. The sales and marketing team, for example, can't invite executives from carrier companies to Shenzhen and usher them into a brand new exhibition hall showing off Huawei's 5G network equipment. The team now hosts virtual tours instead.\n\nEmployees are having to form new habits. They have to complete a \"daily health check-in\" using a mobile app, before they're allowed to enter Huawei offices. CNN Business was sent images of the app by a Huawei spokesperson. Staff must confirm that they don't have a fever or any other coronavirus symptoms and that they are not in quarantine. If they forget to fill in the questionnaire, their employee ID card stops working until a manager gives the all clear.\n\nThe impact is visible too, the spokesperson said. There are fewer buses shuttling people around Huawei's sprawling campus, and the ones in service have blocked off every other row to ensure people stay a safe distance apart. That means more employees are driving their own cars, and competing for spots in Huawei's staff parking lots.\n\nStaff cafeterias are closed. Lunch boxes are delivered to a central point before being distributed around the building. Everyone has been asked to eat at their desks.\n\nHuawei's new routine illustrates how even as China is trying to restart its economy as the outbreak there subsides, life is anything but normal.\n\nIf there's one positive lesson the company has learned from the pandemic so far, it's that \"you don't have to sit face-to-face to have a good meeting, and you don't really have to all sit in one room to have a good press conference,\" Xu said on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the immediate crisis may have passed, Huawei is now operating in a vastly different business environment.\n\nThe pandemic has brought about \"new, unexpected challenges, like economic decline, financial turmoil and also shrinking market demand,\" Xu said. Smartphone sales in China collapsed this quarter, as the country practically ground to a halt to contain the outbreak.\n\nHuawei has been working with clients around the world to ensure the internet can handle the surge in online activities, like virtual meetings and school classes, and streaming TV shows.\n\nLast year, the company reported annual revenue of 858.8 billion yuan ($121 billion), up 19% compared to a year earlier, with net profit of 62.7 billion yuan ($8.8 billion).\n\nMeanwhile, with the coronavirus pandemic still fast developing \"we don't have the time yet to either forecast or evaluate how our annual numbers will look like,\" Xu said.\n\n\"For 2020, we'll try everything we can to continue to survive,\" he added.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB3-11",

Now, under the temporary rules, motion pictures need only to have \"had a bona fide theatrical release planned to begin in Los Angeles\" to be deemed eligible. The modified rules are in effect from March 15 until April 30, 2020, though HFPA said it will continue to monitor the COVID-19 epidemic and reserves the right to extend those dates. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are set to return to the Golden Globes as co-hosts for the 2021 telecast, the date of which has yet to be announced. On Friday, The Television Academy announced changes to be implemented for the 72nd Emmy Awards season in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The updates include a revised Emmy voting calendar, modification of the hanging episode rule for series and limited series, and suspension of For Your Consideration industry events. Due to production and programming delays, the Academy has extended the eligibility date for \"hanging episodes\" to June 30, instead of May 31. The revised Emmy Awards calendar is now as follows: There are currently no plans to cancel or delay the September 20 Emmy telecast or the September 12 and 13 Creative Arts Emmy ceremonies.",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 955518, "name": "Brian Lowry"}, "body": "The irony is that this HBO Sports project was scheduled to air during the tournament. Instead, it's playing at time when fans are understandably pining for such events, now that March Madness has been canceled due to public-health concerns over coronavirus.\n\nIn \"The Scheme,\" Dawkins -- currently appealing his conviction for bribery- - sits for an extensive interview that casts doubts on the FBI's tactics, while matter-of-factly discussing the extent to which coaches and agents flout NCAA rules by funneling money to prospective players and their families, despite indignant denials from coaches.\n\nThose sequences strike the sharpest nerve, as director Pat Kondelis illustrates the depths of corruption within college basketball, while Dawkins seeks to poke holes in the government's efforts. As he tells it, he had no need to bribe coaches because he was already paying players, despite the undercover agent urging him to do so. (Nobody from the FBI or NCAA would participate in the documentary, it's noted at the end.)\n\nIn what's sure to be the most-talked-about sequence, Dawkins describes what he calls Oscar-worthy press conferences by head coaches insisting they didn't interact with him. Kondelis then juxtaposes statements by Arizona's Sean Miller and LSU's Will Wade with wiretapped phone calls of the two men engaging in chummy conversations with Dawkins, with Wade at one point joking about how much a player would be paid. The FBI, meanwhile, engineered the sting by tossing around money, with an agent masquerading as a shadowy financier who rented yachts, handed out envelopes filled with cash and paid for lavish hotel suites. During another recorded call, Dawkins brags to what he thinks is his benefactor, \"I can go to Arizona's practices like I'm on the team.\" Dawkins makes no bones about paying players, saying, \"I don't see anything wrong with it.\" The documentary makes clear that huge money surrounds top recruits, who generate lucrative contracts for coaches, while filling university coffers via TV rights deals and sponsorship agreements with shoe companies like Nike and Adidas. (Both CNN and HBO are part of WarnerMedia, which partners with CBS to broadcast the NCAA Tournament.) As Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel notes, each potential first-round pick amounts to a lottery ticket that's certain to cash out. Because of that incentive and the arcane nature of NCAA rules promoting amateurism, he says, \"You end up dealing with unsavory people or ridiculous circumstances.\" \"The Scheme\" takes about 25 minutes -- most of it devoted to Dawkins' biography and early life -- before the narrative really kicks into gear, but after that, it's a riveting, meticulously detailed guide to a system that seemingly invites rule breaking at every turn. Not that its revelations should come as a complete surprise to anyone. \"The Scheme\" opens with a quote by the late basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian -- a figure who had his share of battles with the NCAA -- that reads, \"Nine out of 10 schools are cheating. The other one is in last place.\" More than anything, at this particular moment \"The Scheme\" feels like an exercise in cognitive dissonance -- demonstrating that it's possible to miss college basketball and still be clear eyed about its abundant flaws. If that's not as exciting as a buzzer beater, for now, it's the next best thing. \"The Scheme\" premieres March 31 at 9 p.m. on HBO.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1,

The official green flag time will be announced at a later date.\n\nINDYCAR and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway made the announcement Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe GMR Grand Prix is moved to Saturday, July 4 on the IMS road course. It will be part of a double-header with the Brickyard 400. The NASCAR race was moved to July 4 at IMS for the first time this year. Drivers will compete on the same track on the same weekend.\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 was originally scheduled for Sunday, May 24, in its traditional spot on the calendar during Memorial Day weekend. The GMR Grand Prix was scheduled to be run on Saturday, May 9.\n\nTickets already purchased for the Indianapolis 500, GMR Grand Prix, Miller Lite Carb Day and Crown Royal Armed Forces Qualifying Weekend will be valid on the rescheduled dates.\n\nAll concerts scheduled for the original Indy 500 weekend in May are canceled. This includes REO Speedwagon and Styx on Friday, May 22, Luke Bryan on Saturday, May 23 and Martin Garrix on Sunday, May 24.\n\nFans who made concert-specific purchases can get a credit for any IMS event, including the Indy 500, or choose to receive a refund.\n\n\"The Month of May at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is my favorite time of year, and like our fans, I am disappointed that we have had to reschedule the Indianapolis 500,\" Roger Penske said. \"However, the health and safety of our event participants and spectators is our top priority, and we believe that postponing the event is the responsible decision with the conditions and restrictions we are facing.\"\n\nEvery year since 1946, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Speedway during Memorial Day weekend for the largest single-day sporting event in the world, but the coronavirus pandemic has turned the traditional sports schedule upside down.\n\nSince the inaugural race was held in 1911, the \"Greatest Spectacle in Racing” has only been put on hiatus twice. The first occasion was from 1917 to 1918 because of World War I, and the second time was from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II.\n\nOn-track action in August will begin at IMS with practice sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, August 12-13, followed by Fast Friday on August 14 and Indianapolis 500 Qualifications on Saturday and Sunday August 15-16.\n\nThe Indy Lights Freedom 100 race, the Indy 500 Pit Stop Challenge, and final Indianapolis 500 practice will take place on Friday, August 21 as part of Miller Lite Carb Day, followed by the public drivers' meeting and full-field autograph session on Saturday, August 22 as part of Legends Day.\n\nAs most every fan knows, the race is the big event at the end of a month-long celebration in Indianapolis. On March 18, the 500 Festival announced the suspension of all in-person events through May 9, including the OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon. That event is now a “virtual race.” The 500 Festival says registered runners will receive details on how to participate virtually and still earn their 2020 shirt and medal.\n\nHere is an updated 2020

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2146507, "name": "Oscar Holland"}, "body": "One of the art world's biggest events, Art Basel, has been postponed as the coronavirus pandemic continues to grip Europe, it was announced the four-day event will now be held in September.\n\nThe Swiss art fair, which last year attracted almost 93,000 visitors from around the world, was due to take place in June. But following the announcement of tightened travel restrictions across Europe, organizers said in a press release that the decision to postpone was reached \"in close consultation with a wide range of gallerists, collectors, partners, and external experts, with the goal of both protecting the health and safety of our community, and ensuring that the fair will be attended by the largest possible number of collectors, curators, and arts professionals from our global network.\"\n\nNow in its 51st year, Art Basel is a key date in the cultural calendar, offering over 250 galleries an opportunity to court collectors in an industry still heavily dependent on in-person sales. Organizers have not yet announced details about refunds or compensation for exhibiting galleries and ticket holders.\n\nIn a statement, Global Director of Art Basel Marc Spiegler said: 'We thank our galleries for the support and understanding of our highly complex decision to postpone the fair. We hope that the situation improves swiftly, and we will work closely with our exhibitors to deliver a successful fair in September.\"\n\nHe further suggested that there was a possibility the new fair dates, currently set for September 17-20, might change. \"At the same time, we are aware of how dynamic the Covid-19 situation is and will continue to monitor the developments closely... we will adapt all our planning to the developing situation,\" he said.\n\nAt present, the Swiss government's ban on public and private events only runs until April 19. But while Art Basel was not set to begin until June 18, the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, which borders northern Italy, continues to grow. Switzerland has thus far reported over 10,000 infections -- more than both the UK and South Korea -- and 153 deaths as a result of the virus.\n\nAlthough Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, and is therefore excluded from the temporary closure of the bloc's borders, the country has moved to restrict non-essential travel. On Wednesday, the government announced that only Swiss residents and citizens -- and those of neighboring Liechtenstein -- or people traveling for work-related or emergency reasons, will be permitted to enter.\n\nArt Basel joins a growing list of major art fairs to be canceled or postponed, from Photo London and Frieze New York to Jingart in Beijing. The economic impact of these cancellations is likely to be significant, with fairs responsible for over $16 billion in transactions -- or 45% of sales made by art dealers worldwide -- in 2019, according to a joint report by Art Basel and the investment bank UBS.\n\nThe Swiss fair had already pulled the plug on its Hong Kong edition, which would have taken place last week. Organizers instead arranged digital \" viewing rooms ,\" which allowed potential buyers to browse and buy artworks via online. The initiative saw 235 galleries exhibit more than 2,000 artworks, as well as some hosting virtual tours. Art Basel said that 250,000 people \"visited\" the viewing rooms, though sales figures have not yet been disclosed\n\nArt Basel's Miami Beach edition is still scheduled to go ahead in December.\n\nArt Basel had not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Cardoz had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\"It is with deep sorrow that we inform you of the passing away of Chef Floyd Cardoz,\" according to a statement from Hunger Inc. Hospitality, where Cardoz was the culinary director.\n\nCardoz tested positive for Covid-19 on March 18 and was being treated for it at Mountainside Medical Center in New Jersey, the statement said.\n\nRaised in Mumbai, India, Cardoz went to Les Roches culinary school in Switzerland before coming to New York City.\n\nHe later opened Pao Walla in New York City's Soho neighborhood, and followed that up with Bombay Bread Bar, which closed last year.\n\nCardoz also had restaurants in Mumbai -- Bombay Canteen, O Pedro and Bombay Sweet Shop.\n\nThe chef was the author of two cookbooks: \"One Spice, Two Spice: American Food, Indian Flavors\" (2006) and \"Floyd Cardoz: Flavorwalla: Big Flavor. Bold Spices. A New Way to Cook the Foods You Love\" (2016).\n\nCardoz admitted himself to the hospital on March 17 after feeling feverish.\n\nHe had recently returned from India, where he was filming the Netflix series, \"Ugly Delicious\" with actor Aziz Ansari. He posted a selfie on Instagram that day.\n\nAnother Instagram post from Bombay Canteen from that day read, \"Chef Floyd Cardoz (59 years), Culinary Director, Hunger, Inc was admitted into hospital in New York with a viral fever. Chef Floyd who was earlier in Mumbai left the city on March 8 for New York via Frankfurt airport. He is being closely monitored for his condition and we wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nFood magnate David Chang posted about Cardoz's death on Instagram: \"Heartbroken over the loss of Floyd Cardoz to COVID-19. Rest in peace Floyd...we will carry on your beautiful legacy.\"\n\n\"I am shocked and so sad,\" said TV chef and cookbook author Madhur Jaffrey.\n\n\"He had such ambitions. He was an innovator. He was all set to do so much more. To be struck down like this in the midst of a brilliant career is heartbreaking,\" Jaffrey said.\n\nChef Preeti Mistry, of Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, also reflected on Cardoz's life and legacy.\n\n\"I have always snarked that the media acted like he was the only Indian chef in the (United States),\" Mistry told CNN. \"And yet he was that guy that everybody looked to and followed. And now he is gone and it's just really f**king sad. And I'm so angry at this whole virus and world.\"\n\nChef Michael Anthony, executive chef of Gramercy Tavern in New York, called Cardoz \"a constant source of knowledge and inspiration.\"\n\n\"With his passing the restaurant industry has suffered a great loss and our thoughts especially go out to his wife and two boys,\" Anthony said.\n\nCardoz is survived by his mother Beryl, wife Barkha and sons Justin and Peter.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB8", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB8", "parent": null}, "score": 0.19,

In public remarks, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has consistently targeted China for an alleged lack of transparency at the outset of the pandemic. CNN has learned that the administration has implemented a coordinated messaging campaign , which includes talking points sent out by the National Security Council pushing US officials to highlight China's alleged \"coverup\" and subsequent disinformation campaign. Der Spiegel was first to report on the inclusion of the phrase in the draft. Asked about the German outlet's report on Wednesday, Pompeo did not deny it. \"With respect to the statement, I always think about these meetings the right answer is to make sure we have the same message coming out of it,\" he said during a press availability at the State Department. Pompeo said that the pandemic was \"the most pressing agenda item\" at Wednesday's meeting. \"There was a lot of discussion today amongst the G7 about the intentional disinformation campaign that China has been and continues to be engaged in,\" he said. China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause to the World Health Organization on December 31, while Chinese officials say they began regular contact with the US about the virus on January 3. The first US case was confirmed January 20. State Department officials have said that the use of the phrase \"Wuhan virus\" is meant to counter such disinformation. However, critics say the phrase is inflammatory, particularly as Asians and Asian Americans in the US report heightened incidents of racism and xenophobia. When the virus was officially named, WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that \"having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.\" said Tuesday that he has decided to pull back from associating the coronavirus with China, which he had previously done by calling it the \"China virus\" or the \"Chinese virus.\" said Tuesday that he

(CBS46) -- Several small businesses are being forced to close their doors due to the coronavirus.\nBut local cycling studio co-owners got a little creative to keep their business afloat – and give their customers an outlet while they're stuck at home.\n“We said, you know what, we’ve got 48 bikes sitting in our studio, collecting dust, and there are people out there who need it,” Kirsten Rickers said.\nKirsten Rickers and Lee Oesterling, the co-owners of Cyclebar East Cobb, allowed customers to take stationary bikes home during the downtime caused by the temporary closure.\n“In like two days, we rented a truck and delivered them all,” added Oesterling.\nInstead of coming into the studio, they’re offering online classes -- knowing many people are stuck indoors due to the coronavirus.\n“It’s not just the physical activity that keeps us connected, it’s great therapy, and I think in times like this, we need it,” Rickers said.\nThey charge a small rental fee per month, which will help pay operating expenses the business needs to pay in the interim.  \n“We’ve had a lot of our riders say, you know what, we support you, we want to keep paying, even if they don’t have a bike, and when we do reopen, we’ll add rides to their account,” Rickers added.\n“This is way for us to get the bikes to them, and if they keep their membership with us, they can have access to our livestream classes,” said Oesterling.\nThe response from the community was overwhelming, all 48 bikes were reserved within hours, and people are offering to also buy gift cards for future rides to ensure the business stays afloat.\n“Even more, our riders are so thankful, too, because they’re cooped up in their houses, they need to stay active, they’re used to being in here almost every day,” Oesterling said. “We can’t wait to open our doors again and see everybody face to face.”\nSchedule for the Week with the Zoom link\nKatie 30 Min Express Ride \nTuesday, Mar 24, 2020 12:00 PM Eastern Time (US and

The €1 million will fund two intensive care units for Lisbon's Hospital de Santa Maria as it grapples with the COVID-19 outbreak. Those two units can cater for up to 20 patients at one time and will be named after Ronaldo and Mendes, the hospital told CNN Sport. \"They were absolutely unselfish and supportive,\" said Santa Maria President Daniel Ferro in a statement. \"They wanted to improve the conditions of their compatriots. Therefore, we reinforced the critical care area, which is the one where the biggest fight will be fought.\" In Porto, the Santo Antonio hospital will have one ward equipped with 15 intensive care beds, ventilators and monitors, reported Reuters. \"We want to thank Ronaldo and Mendes for the initiative, which is so useful at the time the country needs everyone so much,\" Paulo Barbosa, president of Santo Antonio's administrative council, said in a statement. Portugal has just over 2,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 23 deaths. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has also made a €1 million donation, helping fund the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation and the Medical College of Barcelona. The College said the donation would go towards the purchase and supply of medical and protective equipment for doctors fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Last week, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski also donated €1 million to help fight the outbreak in Germany.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-15", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

'Waited eight years for this' Athletes and individual federations had begun questioning whether it was safe to stage the Games in Tokyo amid the global pandemic and had started to urge organizers to take action as soon as possible. Australia and Canada then became the first countries to pull their athletes out of the competition which led to a number of other nations doing the same. World champion heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson was one of the leading athletes who had raised her concerns about competing in Japan later this year. \"Waited eight years for this, what's another one in the grand scheme of things? As an athlete, it's heartbreaking news about the Olympics being postponed until 2021, but it's for all the right reasons and the safety of everyone! Stay indoors,\" the Briton wrote on Twitter. Similarly, Dutch sprinter Dafne Schippers wrote on Instagram to say she had been looking forward to competing in Tokyo this summer but \"for now we have to look at the bigger picture and do whatever it takes to beat the coronavirus.\" FINALLY The OLYMPICS OFFICIALLY postponed for a year!!

See you in 2021,\" Italian track cycling champion Elia Viviani wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, US swimmer Ryan Lochte admitting to being a little annoyed given the training he has put in. \"This Olympics was going to be the most important Olympics of my career because of everything that's happened in my past,\" he told the LA Times. \"But this whole thing is way bigger than me.

It added, however, that the administration's policy -- officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols -- will not be canceled, nor will any hearings. .\n\nThe administration's so-called Remain in Mexico policy requires migrants, many of whom are from Central America, to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration hearings. It has resulted in the creation of makeshift camps where hundreds of migrants have waited for weeks, if not months, in squalid and unsafe conditions. In some cases, migrant families have opted to send children across the US-Mexico border alone.\n\nThe growing coronavirus pandemic and new restrictions at the US-Mexico border have raised questions about the program and its enrollees.\n\nEOIR said Monday that any individual with a hearing date through April 22 should still present themselves at their designated port of entry on their previously scheduled date \"to receive a tear sheet and hearing notice containing their new hearing dates.\"\n\nThe administration's policy has ping-ponged in the courts since its implementation, ultimately landing before the Supreme Court Earlier this month, the Supreme Court said that the policy can stay in effect while legal challenges play out, marking a victory for the administration, which has increasingly relied on the program since its implementation. Lawyers for the asylum seekers called the government's policy illegal, adding that in the months that it has been in effect \"reports of murder, rape, torture kidnapping, and other violent assaults against returned asylum seekers have climbed.\" But the administration argued, amid the coronavirus outbreak, that blocking the program would prompt a \"rush to the border.\" In anticipation of the Supreme Court's ruling, the Defense Department deployed its Crisis Response Force in support of US Customs and Border Protection, resulting in approximately 160 active duty personnel shifted to the southern border. EOIR concluded its statement Monday saying that the agency, along with the Department of Homeland Security, is \"deeply committed to ensuring that individuals 'have their day in court' while also

It's so difficult to accept that someone who was so full of life will no longer call to check in again,\" she added. Makamba as a high school student where he frequently won awards and trophies, his friend Vimbai Muthinhiri said. Zimbabwe's information minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, said she received the news with \"extreme sadness and deep sense of shock.\" Makamba had traveled to New York on February 29 and returned to his home in Harare on March 9. He began to exhibit mild flu-like symptoms a few days later on March 12. He then contacted his doctor a week later and he was advised to self isolate, the Health Minister Obadiah Moyo said in the statement. On arrival at hospital, Makamba developed severe respiratory distress and was kept in isolation under supervision from health practitioners. Authorities are now tracing people who came into contact with him. Mutsvangwa urged the nation to take precautions against Covid-19 after Zimbabwe confirmed its first case late last week. \"As we mourn him the whole nation should take the threat of COVID 1 very seriously. Let's all follow due medical precautions as announced by the Ministry of Health and by the World Health Organization,\" Mutsvangwa said. Meanwhile, in an address to the nation on Monday night, Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced the closure of all borders except for returning residents and cargo effective immediately. Mnangagwa also announced that all gatherings over 50 people will be banned and bars, nightclubs, gyms and swimming pools will be closed in an effort to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.",

In this case, many staff members were exposed,\" Goffman said. Testing women in labor, she added, would allow doctors to isolate newborns who may have been exposed to the virus, thus preventing outbreaks in neonatal ICUs and well-baby nurseries. With more than 15,000 people infected with the virus, New York state now has almost half of all cases in the United States. Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday called for the federal government to nationalize the effort to acquire medical supplies as states compete with one another for equipment. Absent in-person visitors for patients in labor, Goffman said the hospital system was looking into ways to allow families to participate virtually in childbirth, perhaps through tablet computers. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. \"We recognize that we will need to provide additional support for moms, as well as mom and baby pairs, as they're in the hospital through the duration of their stay,\" she said. The World Health Organization says that \"all pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth,\" which includes \"having a companion of choice present during delivery.\" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises limiting \"visitors to patients with known or suspected COVID-19.\" The agency adds that, \"if restriction of all visitors is implemented, facilities can consider exceptions based on end-of-life situations or when a visitor is essential for the patient's emotional well-being and care.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7", "parent": null},

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 961642, "name": "Clare Duffy"}, "body": "New York (CNN Business) Emirates Group is temporarily suspending most passenger flights — maintaining just its cargo operations — because of coronavirus .\n\nThe Dubai-based airline plans to halt most passenger services as of March 25, it said in a statement Sunday. After initially saying it would suspend all passenger flights, the company amended its statement later Sunday to say it will continue operating passenger flights to 13 destinations in response to \"requests from governments.\"\n\nEmirates is also taking a number of other cost-cutting measures, including reducing operations at its air services division, Dnata, and a temporary cut to most employees' basic salaries.\n\nThe announcement comes as airlines around the world grapple with a massive loss of business as demand for air travel dries up amid the coronavirus outbreak. Around the world, coronavirus cases have topped 300,000, nearly 13,000 people have died and many countries and local jurisdictions have implemented travel restrictions to stop the spread.\n\nUS airlines say they have seen a \"virtual shutdown\" in air domestic travel, and some wonder if federal officials will ground many or all domestic flights. The US airline industry is seeking about $50 billion in federal help to deal with the crisis.\n\n\"The world has literally gone into quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak,\" Emirates Group chairman and CEO HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in the statement.\n\n\"As a global network airline, we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot viably operate passenger services until countries re-open their borders, and travel confidence returns. By Wednesday 25 March, although we will still operate cargo flights which remain busy, Emirates will have temporarily suspended most of its passenger operations,\" he said.\n\nEmirates will continue to operate its international air cargo network to transport \"essential goods including medical supplies\" around the world.\n\nPassenger flights will continue to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, South Africa, the United States and Canada \"until further notice, as long as borders remain open,\" Emirates said in its updated statement Sunday.\n\nThe company said it is taking steps to protect the health of employees who have to continue coming to work, including enhanced cleaning at its facilities and on its planes, temperature screening at office entry points and providing hand sanitizers and masks to some frontline employees.\n\nIn order to further manage costs, the President of Emirates Tim Clark and President of Dnata Gary Chapman plan to take a 100% basic salary cut for three months.\n\nEmirates also plans to cut most employees' basic salaries by 25% to 50% for three months, in what the company said is a move to avoid having to lay off staff. Employees will still receive \"other allowances\" during this time, and junior level employees will be exempt from the salary reduction.\n\n\"Rather than ask employees to leave the business, we chose to implement a temporary basic salary cut as we want to protect our workforce and keep our talented and skilled people, as much as possible,\" Sheikh Ahmed said. \"We want to avoid cutting jobs. When demand picks up again, we also want to be able to quickly ramp up and resume services for our customers.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-7", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

They knew the pain of juggling kids with the job -- Abraham Lincoln's mischievous son Tad reputedly once worked out how to ring all the service bells in the White House at once. JFK's kids turned the Oval Office into a playroom.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy claps while his children, Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., dance in the Oval Office on Oct. 10, 1962. (Courtesy Kennedy Library)\n\nCute little John-John never lived down the famous picture of him hiding under his Dad's desk, which years later took on extra poignancy after both suffered early deaths.\n\nWe're all finding out how domestic bliss can interfere with your to-do list, but John Adams, the first President to live in the White House, knew all about that. His wife, Abigail, used to hang laundry in the East Room.\n\nAnd those mornings flapping around for something to wear are a thing of the past -- you can just work in your pajamas, as Gerald Ford discovered in his hotel home-away-from-home on a trip to Japan.\n\nOne good thing about working from home is that you don't have to go out to eat -- Ronald Reagan often made the 45-second commute from the Oval Office to the White House residence for dinner with the first lady.\n\nBarack Obama wrote in 2016 that \"perhaps the greatest unexpected gift of this job has been living above the store.\" The 44th president used to drop everything to eat dinner with his wife and daughters each night.\n\nAnother unexpected revelation about working from home is that the barriers between work and home life soon tumble. Lyndon Johnson's aides found this out to their cost when the then-President insisted on dictating notes while on the can.\n\nWhen your home is your office, you can steal a few quiet moments off the grid -- and catch up with that book you've been reading -- as Harry S Truman loved to do on the balcony that now bears his name.\n\nWorking from home is often seen as a perk -- but by the time the coronavirus pandemic blows itself out, we might all be desperate to get back to the office. Most presidents could empathize; they often say that though they love the White House, sometimes they'd appreciate a change of scene.\n\nStill, the dog loves having you home.", "categories":

Stores around the country have been flooded with frantic shoppers buying toilet paper, non-perishable goods and other household items in recent weeks.\n\nIn response, major retailers have begun carving out time for those more vulnerable to the virus to buy food and supplies without having to worry about large crowds.\n\nOn Thursday, Publix became one of the latest major grocery store to announce special hours for senior citizens. Publix customers who are 65 and older can shop at store locations nationwide on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 7 am to 8 am beginning next week. Publix's pharmacy will open for seniors at 7 am on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the company said in a written statement\n\nGiant Food is giving people over the age of 60 and individuals with critical health issues other than coronavirus an hour to shop from 6 am to 7 am beginning on Friday, according to a statement on the company's website.\n\nWalmart, the nation's largest grocery store chain, said it will run hour-long senior shopping for people aged 60 and older one hour before its stores are scheduled to open each day beginning on March 24 and ending on April 28.\n\nThe company recently adjusted its operating hours to 7 am to 8:30 pm nationwide to allow its employees more time to restock shelves and sanitize stores in accordance with recommended guidelines from the CDC.\n\n\"We know our older customers could be more vulnerable to the coronavirus,\" the company said. \"We are paying very close attention to our stores and communities and will continue making the necessary changes to help make sure our associates are taken care of and that our customers can get what they need.\"\n\nStop & Shop is now giving customers vulnerable to coronavirus 90 exclusive minutes to buy groceries from 6 am to 7:30 am.\n\n\"These hours are to help our more vulnerable customers shop in a less crowded environment, if they prefer,\" the Ahold Delhaize-owned company said in a statement on Wednesday. \"We plan to make these hours available EVERY day during this period, so it's not necessary for everyone to come on the first day.\"\n\nDollar General stores across the country started offering \"senior hour\" on Tuesday. In a Monday statement, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos his company's stores will dedicate the first hour of each day to seniors looking to shop.\n\n\"We appreciate our customers' understanding of our decision and request they visit our stores later in the morning to allow at-risk populations the ability to purchase the items they need at affordable prices,\" Vasos said.\n\nFood Lion declined to comment on whether it will set aside special times for those more vulnerable to coronavirus to shop.\n\n\"At this time, our stores are open to all customers during our normal hours of operation,\" a Food Lion spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nCostco and Trader Joe's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB22-2", "level": 2,

Everybody stay home,'\" he said.\n\nOn the same Burr made his comments, February 27, Trump was downplaying the coronavirus risk , one day after he had named Vice President Mike Pence to lead a coronavirus task force. \"It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear,\" he said. \"And from our shores, you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows.\" A day earlier, Trump predicted the number of cases in the US could quickly drop to zero. \"When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done,\" Trump said on February 26. Burr and his committee have been briefed on the coronavirus outbreak as it's spread, but Burr's February warnings were based primarily on his experience working on public health preparedness and pandemics, as well as the warnings already coming from public health officials, according to two sources. Pence had just been tapped to lead the coronavirus task force, there had been increased warnings about the outbreak in Italy and travel restrictions in China were already been in place for weeks. Burr is also an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which was first enacted in 2006 and was renewed last year. Publicly, Burr did not issue such dire warnings about the coming impact to the US due to the coronavirus outbreak, though he did talk about the need for the government to respond to the virus. Burr wrote an op-ed with GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee February 7 outlining the steps the US government had available to combat coronavirus. At a March 3 Senate hearing, Burr questioned CDC officials on the issues with producing tests for coronavirus. \"Senator Burr has been banging the drum about the importance of public health preparedness for more than 20 years. His message has always been, and continues to be, that we must be prepared to protect American lives in the event of a pandemic or bio-attack,\" Burr spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said in a statement when asked about the NPR recording. \"Since early February, whether in constituent meetings or open hearings, he has worked to educate the public about the tools and resources our government has to confront the spread of coronavirus. At the same time, he has urged public officials to fully utilize every tool at their disposal in this effort.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

By the time she made it home, she had a fever and decided to rest.\n\nAfter waking up in the middle of the night, Driscoll was struggling to catch her breath and raced to the hospital where she got confirmation that she had Covid-19.\n\nIt was a battle inside her body, she says, and nurses could only help her by giving her fluids and medicine for the pain and fever.\n\n\"I had to battle out the fever and battle out how I felt,\" she said. After spending a few days in the hospital, Driscoll is in quarantine. Her son, who's with her at their home, has some mild symptoms but hasn't been able to get tested. 'I didn't think much of it' Hundreds of miles away, Rev. Eric Elnes is quarantined in Omaha, Nebraska, after learning he had the novel coronavirus. After returning from a trip to Spain, Elnes, 56, was feeling great until he noticed a slight cough. He thought it was allergies but later started growing suspicious. \"I didn't think much of it,\" he said. Infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized Since Elnes, who is the senior minister at Countryside Community Church, tested positive for coronavirus, he's felt great for the most part and thinks he's a source of concern. \"I can't even imagine now the people who have been exposed to somebody like me,\" Elnes said. The minister has been livestreaming his church service from quarantine but he's still worried that others close to him may have been exposed. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have said that while it's clear asymptomatic spread does happen, it does not appear to be the driver of the outbreak. But several experts interviewed by CNN said transmission by people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic is responsible for more transmission than previously thought.

Coronavirus has spread to all states, the District of Columbia and some territories.\n\nA former firefighter who helped after the Sept. 11 attacks\n\nJohn Knox fought fires in New York for nearly four decades.\n\nWhen terrorists hit the twin towers on September 11, years after he'd retired from the Fire Department of New York, he put on his old uniform, grabbed his gear and pick ax, and rushed to the World Trade Center to help find firefighters trapped in the rubble.\n\nSo much so, he never returned his fire gear after he retired, and asked the FDNY to bill him for the items, his son said.\n\n\"He took his vehicle and all the gear that he still had remaining from his time at the FDNY .... and made the trek all the way to Ground Zero, and he was down there for several weeks afterward,\" Zachary Knox told CNN's Anderson Cooper of his father's decision to help after September 11.\n\nThe elder Knox had pre-existing medical conditions from his work at Ground Zero following the terror attacks, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. His son said he developed symptoms of what appeared to be a light flu, and was hospitalized for about three weeks after he collapsed due to dehydration. His breathing got worse, and he died Monday.\n\nHis son described him as a vibrant 84-year-old who went to the gym until a couple of weeks ago and kept people decades younger on their toes.\n\n\"He was .... a man full of integrity,\" his son said. \"He lived and died by his word. That's the way he always was .... and everybody, love or hate him, always respected him.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Knox got coronavirus. Zachary Knox is mourning his father while in self-quarantine because he visited him while he was hospitalized.\n\nRichard Curren lived at a Florida assisted living facility with his wife of more than five decades. The retired magician fell ill last week and died days later.\n\nCurren was hospitalized with respiratory issues considered fairly routine, and died this week, his family said. Doctors notified family members that he died of complications from coronavirus.\n\nThe 77-year-old Fort Lauderdale resident loved sharing his magic tricks with children.\n\n\"No matter how many joint replacement surgeries he endured, he still couldn't resist a chance to get down on the carpet to play with a toddler,\" his family told the affiliate.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1017808, "name": "Paul Leblanc"}, "body": "\"On Saturday evening, Congressman Diaz-Balart developed symptoms including a fever and headache. Just a short while ago, he was notified that he has tested positive for COVID-19,\" his office said in a news release.\n\nThe Florida Republican said in a statement that he is \"feeling much better\" but urged the public to take the virus \"extremely seriously.\"\n\n\"We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times,\" he said. Wednesday's statement did not detail how Diaz-Balart may have contracted the disease. He was the first lawmaker to announce a positive test.\n\nLater on Wednesday evening, McAdams, a Utah Democrat, said he too had been diagnosed.\n\n\"Today I learned that I tested positive,\" he said in a statement released on Twitter. \"I am still working for Utahns and pursuing efforts to get Utahns the resources they need as I continue doing my job from home until I know it is safe to end my self-qurantine.\" The unsettling development underscores the unique challenge facing lawmakers as they both grapple with how to contain the spread of coronavirus throughout the US and take steps to avoid spreading it within Congress. The announcements come the same day President Donald Trump signed a coronavirus relief package that includes provisions for free testing and paid emergency leave as the death toll from the virus continues to climb and state and local governments hand down more aggressive social-distancing requirements. As of Wednesday, more than 8,500 Americans have been infected with coronavirus, and that number changes significantly by the hour. But news of cases within the halls of Congress could upend legislative business on the Hill, setting off a new wave of self-quarantine measures from lawmakers that may have interacted with Diaz-Balart o McAdams, who both decided to self-quarantine after participating in House votes on Friday. Thus far, at least 14 other lawmakers have announced steps to self-quarantine or otherwise isolate themselves as a precaution after coming into contact with an infected individual. The cases are also a realization of discussions within Congress over the inevitability of lawmakers testing positive for the disease -- something for which a number of House and Senate offices have been preparing. US Capitol Police have been working to ensure that secure communications can continue off-site and the leaders of key congressional committees, along with law enforcement authorities and the Capitol physician's office, have informed each lawmaker's office to prepare contingency plans in case of an outbreak.

(Photo by Caroline Brehman/CQ Roll Call via AP Images) In fact, the signs the Capitol is preparing have been visible for weeks, with hand sanitizers littering virtually every corner of the building. News of Diaz-Balart and McAdams' positive tests also comes the same day a bipartisan group of House lawmakers sent a letter to congressional leadership requesting a rule change that would allow for remote voting during the pandemic. \"While Congress is an institution with a proud history, we cannot stand on tradition if it puts lives -- and our ability to be the voice of our constituents -- at risk,\" the letter says.

He responded by claiming that his tone hadn't changed much at all.\n\n\"I mean, I have seen that, where people actually liked it. But I didn't feel different,\" he said at a White House press briefing. \"I've always known, this is a real -- this is a real -- this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do was look at other countries...no, I've always viewed it as very serious. It was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn't.\"\n\nFacts First: From January until last week, Trump consistently minimized the risk the coronavirus posed to the country. He : From January until last week, Trump consistently minimized the risk the coronavirus posed to the country. He claimed to have the virus under \"control,\" that the number of US cases would go \" down, not up ,\" that the virus might \" disappear \" through a \"miracle\" or something of the sort, that the virus might well vanish by April with the warmer weather, that the media and Democrats were overhyping the situation, and that \"this is their new hoax ,\" leaving it unclear whether he was calling the virus itself a hoax. (He later said he was talking about Democrats' coronavirus-related criticism, not the virus.)\n\nOn Monday, Trump acknowledged that the situation is \"bad,\" that the virus is not under control, that the country might well be heading into a recession, and that American life would not get back to normal for months. He had not made such statements before. Trump has pointed to his late-January decision to restrict travel from China as evidence that he had always considered the situation \"urgent.\" But he certainly had not clearly communicated that he felt such urgency. Prior to the World Health Organization's official pandemic declaration on March 11, Trump had never told Americans that he viewed the situation as a potential pandemic. When he was asked by CNBC in an interview that aired January 22 if there were worries about a pandemic, he responded , \"No. Not at all. And -- we're -- we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.\" On March 9, Trump tweeted , \"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\" On March 10, the day before the WHO's pandemic declaration, Trump said , \"And we're prepared, and we're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\" He added: \"It's really working out. And a lot of good things are going to happen.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB26-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB26-3",

Closings across the New York area In addition, the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people, the governors of the three states said Monday The three states agreed to close casinos, gyms and movies starting 8 p.m. Monday. All eat-in services from bars and restaurants also will transition to takeout and delivery-only services at the same time.

We know that each comes with its own set of impacts on residents, families, communities and businesses. But at this moment, our paramount concern must be to flatten the curve of new cases so we do not overload our health care system,\" he said. New Jersey needs more hospital beds The moves follows similar limitations that several New Jersey communities have already taken to stop the coronavirus spread. Americans face new shutdowns as coronavirus keeps spreading. But some say the bans aren't enough Hoboken, located just across the Hudson River from New York City's Manhattan, announced Saturday that it was implementing a citywide curfew and restrictions on restaurants and bars. Residents were ordered to stay home from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. unless they have to work during those hours, according to a statement from Mayor Ravinder Bhalla. On Saturday, authorities in Teaneck urged all residents of the township to self-quarantine amid a surge in local cases. \"We don't know how it happened,\" Teaneck Deputy Mayor Elie Katz told CNN. \"Teaneck has been at the forefront from the beginning. We were one of the first to close our municipal buildings and close our schools.\" Murphy said Monday morning that New Jersey, like many other states, is \"woefully short\" on hospital beds to deal with the coming increase in cases. \"We need hospital beds over the next couple of weeks. We are woefully short as a region, as a country, in terms of being able to take care of folks -- especially if this surge comes in the way we expect it,\" he said. \"Even if we're able to flatten the curve in the most optimistic way, we're badly outgunned on that front and that's where we do need the feds to help step up. You saw what happened in China and other places where they were able to build new hospitals and add new capacity in very short order. We have some catching up to do there.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB20", "parent":

Mike DeWine announced on Monday that he is recommending moving the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\n“It is clear that tomorrow’s in person voting does not conform, and cannot conform with these CDC guidelines. We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in person voting for 13 hours tomorrow and conform to these guidelines,” DeWine said.\n\n“We should not be in a situation where the votes of these individuals, who are conflicted, are suppressed. It is therefore my recommendation after talking with the secretary of state, talking with the attorney general, talking with the lieutenant governor, that voting be extended until June 2nd. That no in person voting occur today, but rather that in person voting occur on June 2nd, but between now and then that absentee ballot voting be permitted.”\n\nImportant to note: DeWine, however, said he does not have the power to move the primary unilaterally and will now go to court to move the primary.\n\nThe move is a complicated one for Ohio officials, as voters have already started voting in the state where 136 pledged delegates are at stake.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus has effectively stopped in person campaigning in the Democratic primary, forcing Biden and Sanders to cancel rallies and town halls. It has also had significant implications on down ballot races.\n\nOhio is now the latest state to move elections based on the spread of the coronavirus, joining Louisiana, where state officials moved the presidential primary to June, and Georgia, where elections officials will postpone the March 24 presidential primary to May 19. Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Joe Barbuto also announced Friday that \"the in-person portion\" of their state's caucuses were \"suspended due to growing concern\" over the virus.\n\nBut Ohio’s move is the most significant, given voting had already begun in the state and that it is a sizable delegate prize in the nomination fight.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 952254, "name": "Paul R. La"}, "body": "That's reminding a lot of people of 2008 and the Great Recession. Those were scary times. But to me, the plunge that has accompanied the coronavirus outbreak is bringing back memories of another crisis -- the immediate aftermath of 9/11.\n\nThe stock market was closed for several days following 9/11. Once it reopened on September 17, there was a lot of fear about what was next for corporate America and the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell as much as 13.5% between September 17 and September 21, while the Dow plunged 16.1%. And the national psyche was eerily similar to how people are feeling right now.\n\nBack then, many Americans were confused and scared. Would terrorists target more cities? Would there be biological attacks as well? Everyone was also on high alert for suspicious packages with white powder in them after several letters laced with anthrax were mailed shortly after the attacks.\n\nEconomic slump may be brief but a bear market may persist The good news is that stocks (and the economy) eventually rebounded. But it took time. The bear market that began when tech stocks collapsed in 2000 was compounded by 9/11 and didn't end until stocks bottomed out in October 2002. The following recession was much shorter though. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which calls when recessions begin and end, said that an economic downturn began in March 2001 and was over by November 2001. The Fed did its part to soothe coronavirus fears. Now the president and Congress must act But there is a big difference between now and 2001 that has me nervous. There is no realistic way of knowing just how long the coronavirus scare will keep people home. In 2001, many people carried on as usual, even if we were still sad and frightened. The rallying cry from politicians and other leaders was to not let the terrorists win. I went to Boston days after 9/11 to see jazz legend (and NYC native) Sonny Rollins in concert, for example. And a date that I planned to have on 9/11 was rescheduled for a week later. The woman I went out with is now my wife. Why this stock market sell-off is scarier than 2008 People going on with their daily lives probably helped prevent the 2001 recession from lasting longer. But Americans can't do that now at a time where the fear is catching a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus. We are all being advised to stay home and limit contact with others. Time will heal these wounds more than any Fed action can Social distancing will undoubtedly hurt the economy. Many companies -- both blue chips in the Dow and S&P 500, as well as small businesses -- are suffering. Sure, it may be encouraging to see the Federal Reserve cut rates and try other things to help the economy. It looks like the president and Congress are on board with fiscal stimulus, too. Kevin Hassett: April job losses could be worst ever Kevin Hassett: April job losses could be worst ever Just like in 2001, it will take time before the worst is over. But unlike 2008, this is not something that, at its root, is a financial problem. Or at least, not yet. Lower interest rates, bailouts or tax breaks won't help if people are afraid to leave (or are discouraged from leaving) their homes and businesses suffer major drops in demand. We will all need to be patient and hunker down. This will eventually end, and life will return to something resembling normal. So will the economy and stock market.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13-11", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13-11",

The wooden crucifix at San Marcello dates from the 14th century. Believers first hailed it as \"miraculous\" because it survived a fire which burned down the church on May 23, 1519. Three years after the fire, during Rome's Great Plague, the crucifix was carried by the faithful in procession through all the neighborhoods of Rome, from San Marcello to St. Peter's Basilica. The procession lasted 16 days, from August 4 to 20. Legend has it that the plague ended on the day the crucifix reached St. Peter's. Pope Francis walks along the normally bustling Via del Corso in Rome on March 15, 2020. The street was almost empty because of Italy's strict coronavirus restrictions. Since the 1600s, processions from the Church of San Marcello to St. Peter's Basilica have taken place during Jubilee Years. John Paul II embraced the crucifix during the Jubilee Year of 2000. Shortly before praying before San Marcello's crucifix, Pope Francis visited the icon of the Virgin Mary in the Church of St. Mary Major. Pope Francis gives his blessing to an eerily empty St. Peter's Square Known as Mary, Health of Romans (Salus Populi Romani) it is a favorite icon of Pope Francis; he visits it to pray before and after every papal trip, and ahead of other important events. Like the San Marcello crucifix, the icon was also carried in procession in an effort to help stop a plague -- this one in 593 -- by Pope St. Gregory the Great. In 1837, prayers were offered to the icon by Pope Gregory XVI in an attempt to end a cholera pandemic, according to the Vatican.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB23-4", "level": 2,

This notification applies to jury trials only,\" the memo reads.\n\nIn a statement, Presiding Judge Kevin Brazile said that he does not have the authority to close the courts in the event of a pandemic but can make adjustments to lessen the flow of people in the courthouse. Officials will re-examine the suspension decision before March 30, according to a police memo obtained by CNN. Durst is accused of killing his best friend Susan Berman to stop her from incriminating him in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. The 76-year-old defendant was the subject of the HBO mini-series \"The Jinx.\" He was arrested and charged in March 2015 in the death of Berman, who was found dead in her Beverly Hills home two days before Christmas in 2000.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB12-3", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1055954, "name": "Brian Stelter"}, "body": "New York (CNN Businss) Television is a lifeline as Americans hunker down to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nBut many of the country's favorite daytime and late-night shows are temporarily stopping production.\n\nThe suspensions are across networks and across the board, from \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" to \"The Wendy Williams Show\" to \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\" And they're generally in effect for at least a couple of weeks.\n\nThis will come as bad news to viewers who look to comedians and talk show hosts for a respite from the real world.\n\nIn most cases, the shows will still air in their usual time slots, just with repeat episodes, so viewers won't be totally deprived. But their \"comfort food\" might seem stale -- since the punch-lines and conversations won't reflect the current coronavirus-centric news cycle.\n\nThe suspensions are all about safety. Television networks want to abide by the guidance of public health officials in New York, Los Angeles and other production hubs. The advice is to stay home if at all possible.\n\nAt HBO, which shares corporate parent AT&T with CNN, Bill Maher taped Friday's \"Real Time,\" called it \"Surreal Time,\" and said he's going on a two-week hiatus. At least. \"This may be our last panel for a while,\" he told viewers.\n\nSunday night HBO star John Oliver will have a \"shortened episode\" on Sunday night, the network said, and then Oliver will go on break as well.\n\nLate-night shows on NBC, ABC, CBS, and other channels are all reverting to repeat episodes.\n\nSo are talk shows like \"Tamron Hall\" and \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" and \"The Talk.\"\n\n\"We hope to be back LIVE soon,\" the Twitter account for \"The Talk\" said Friday. \"In the meantime, enjoy some of our favorite episodes starting Mon., 3/16. We can still laugh and share moments. We're in this together.\"\n\nThe \"Ellen\" decision was notable because DeGeneres said Friday morning that she was shifting to a no-audience format next week, and said California governor Gavin Newsom would be one of her guests. Then, five hours later, she said, \"After some more thought, we have decided to suspend production completely until March 30th. We just want to take every precaution to ensure that we do our part to keep everyone healthy.\"\n\nThe changes attest to just how rapidly the pandemic is upending the American way of life.\n\n\"We will continue to assess the situation and restart as soon as feasible,\" the company said.\n\nHollywood is currently in television pilot season, developing potential shows for the coming season, but many pilots are now on hold too.\n\nWarner Bros. Television Group, which shares a corporate parent with CNN, said Friday that it was \"halting production on some of our 70+ series and pilots currently filming or about to begin.\"\n\nNetflix has paused TV and film production in both the US and Canada for two weeks, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. The source cited government restrictions and health and safety precautions.\n\nThe list goes on and on. On Saturday another blockbuster film was added: Warner Bros. said that production of \"The Batman\" movie in London is on \"hiatus\" for two weeks.\n\nTaken all together, these delays will have many ripple effects and cause major financial hits for Hollywood studios and financiers.\n\n\"Early estimates indicate that the blow will be unlike anything Hollywood has experienced before,\" The Hollywood Reporter said earlier this week.\n\nAlready, the financial toll of global box office closures (in China and elsewhere) has stretched into the billions of dollars.", "categories":

The military has felt the effects of the pandemic, as some branches have begun screening new recruits for the virus and US involvement in certain military exercises has been altered in response to the outbreak.\n\nThe travel restriction is slated to last until May 11. Service members may take only local leave during that time, according to the memo.\n\nThe department said in a statement Friday that the travel restriction \"will also pause civilian hiring at DoD installations and components for persons who do not reside within the hiring entity's local commuting area.\" Some travel exceptions will be granted \"on a case by case basis,\" and travel for medical services will be allowed, according to the memo. It notes that \"our understanding of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and this guidance will be continuously evaluated as conditions warrant.\" The department also announced new rules starting Monday for those who can enter the Pentagon building itself. According to a second memo from the department, all unofficial and international visitors will be \"restricted\" from the Pentagon grounds. No military or government employees or contractors will be allowed to enter the Pentagon grounds \"if they have traveled within the previous 14 days\" from countries for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued the highest or second highest travel warnings, per the memo. Additionally, public tours of the Pentagon are canceled \"until further notice,\" the memo states -- echoing the decision earlier this week to halt tours of Capitol Hill for the coming weeks , as sources have told CNN. \"All large gatherings, such as retirement and promotion ceremonies, shall cease,\" the department said in a corresponding statement. \"All Pentagon Tours have been suspended since March 12, 2020.\" This story has been updated with additional information about restrictions to the Pentagon itself.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20", "level": 1, "links":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 953253, "name": "Theresa Waldrop"}, "body": "Elizabeth Schneider, 37, believes she contracted the virus at a house party because a few days later, several friends who were at the party became ill at the same time she did.\n\nThree days after the February 22 party, Schneider says, she was at work when she started feeling unwell.\n\nShe was \"feeling tired, body aches, getting a headache, feeling a little bit feverish,\" so she decided to go home, Schneider told CNN's Erin Burnett.\n\nShe woke up from a nap with a 101 degree fever, and \"by the time I went to bed, it had soared to 103 degrees,\" Schneider said.\n\nSchneider said she thought she had a nasty flu. It didn't occur to her that it could be the coronavirus because the symptoms didn't fit -- she didn't have a cough, no shortness of breath, no respiratory symptoms at all. The \"aha\" moment didn't come until she found out that about a dozen friends who'd been to the same party got sick \"at the exact same day, roughly around the same time in the evening, with very similar symptoms.\" The Seattle area is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Of the 1,635 cases reported in the country since the Covid-19 first appeared in January, 457 of them are in Washington, including 41 deaths. For many Americans, the coronavirus pandemic means a normal life is on hold Still, Schneider and her friends weren't tested for the coronavirus, she said. Their doctors thought they had the flu, but the flu tests were negative. \"At this point, we were all getting a little frustrated that they weren't allowed to be tested for coronavirus, or the doctor wasn't even suggesting\" they be tested for it, Schneider said. So, one of her friends told her about a Seattle flu study. Participants sign up online and send in a nasal swab from a kit that's part of the study. Recently, she said, they started testing for coronavirus, too, and \"that's how I ultimately found out.\" Schneider said she recovered after staying home, resting and taking over-the-counter medications. Worried about coronavirus? If your loved one is over 60, read this \"I think the big takeaway I want to tell everyone is: Please don't panic,\" Schneider said. \"If you are healthy, if you are younger, if you take good care of yourself when you're sick, you will recover, I believe. And I'm living proof of that.\" Schneider, though, had age and otherwise good health on her side. For the elderly or people with underlying health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, Covid-19 can be -- and has been -- deadly, health officials say. \"The grim reality is that, for the elderly, Covid-19 is almost a perfect killing machine,\" American Health Care Association President Mark Parkinson told CNN this week. Some states are restricting visits to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in an effort to stem the spread of the disease to that vulnerable population. Nursing homes in Washington state, for example, have been instructed to limit visitors as coronavirus cases spread across 11 facilities in the state.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7",

It had been scheduled to take place April 24-26 in Indio.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, two sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN that organizers for Coachella would postpone the event. Both events, which attract hundreds of thousands of visitors, join a host of others -- from concert tour legs to conferences -- that have canceled or rescheduled plans as the number of global cases of coronavirus continues to climb. Last week, Austin's South by Southwest Festival was canceled amid concerns over the virus's spread. Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott and Frank Ocean were scheduled to headline Coachella. It is not yet known whether they will perform in October. Other artists set to perform had included Calvin Harris, Big Sean, Lewis Capaldi, Charlie XCX, Flume, 21 Savage, Lana Del Rey and Lil Nas X. Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Eric Church had been set to headline Stagecoach. Organizers said all tickets purchased for the April dates will be honored for the new dates.

More passengers are expected to be removed from the ship Tuesday morning, according to an announcement from the ship's captain.\n\nOn Sunday, the State Department warned Americans to not travel by cruise ship because of a spike in cases of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, linked to cruises.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Princess Cruise Lines of sailing despite \"knowing that the ship was infected from two previous passengers who came down with symptoms of COVID-19, and had sixty two passengers on board.\"\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Princess Cruises issued a statement saying: \"Princess has been sensitive to the difficulties the COVID-19 outbreak has caused to our guests and crew. Our response throughout this process has focused on well-being our guests and crew within the parameters mandated on us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness. We (sic) not been served with any lawsuit relating to this matter, and we will not comment on any pending litigation.\"\n\nThe couple boarded the ship on February 21 and, along with all other passengers in this sailing, were not examined or screened before they got on the vessel even though the ship had previously had two people on board with the virus, the lawsuit said. They were also not given warning by the cruise line of the potential of exposure before they boarded or while they were already aboard, according to the filing.\n\nThe lawsuit says no passengers aboard the Grand Princess were informed when an email went out to previous ship passengers on February 25 notifying them of a possible exposure on the ship.\n\nThe Weissbergers would not have boarded the ship if they had been told and would have disembarked in Honolulu on February 26 if they had been made aware of the risk, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the couple is now at \"actual risk of immediate physical injury.\" They are also \"suffering from emotional distress\" and are \"traumatized from the fear of developing COVID-19,\" according to the suit.", "categories":

They tested her post-mortem, and there's I think a couple others that they're waiting on results, too. There was another lady that had similar circumstances, where she got the call that she had the fever, and then 24 hours later, she's passed.\"\n\nWidespread uncertainty has compounded the grief in Kirkland, Washington. Susan Hailey, 76, is recovering from knee surgery and a broken ankle at Life Care Center. She's already lost one close friend there and worries who else might die from the disease. \"You just don't know who's going to die next,\" she told CNN affiliate KIRO What one first responder saw at the Life Care Cente nursing home \"A very good friend of mine died Sunday,\" she said. \"It's terrible; she was a lovely, lovely woman.\" De los Angeles said she's frustrated that not everyone at the afflicted nursing home was tested for coronavirus. Her mother wasn't tested until after she died. \"I just think that Life Care, being the epicenter around here for the virus ... I think a priority should have been given to get test(s) in there to those residents,\" she said. \"And they said, 'Well, tests were short, there was a shortage.'\" But de los Angeles commended the Life Care Center staff, including those who may be risking their lives to care for their patients. Would you have to pay for a coronavirus test? It depends. \"I have to hand it to the staff. They were way overworked and understaffed,\" de los Angeles said. Before her mom died, her nurse insisted on taking care of her. \"Staff had been getting sick and were out,\" de los Angeles said. \"Mom's nurse, she just kept coming to work because she said, 'Our patients need us' -- even though it was walking into a dangerous situation really every day.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB4-7", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Discussions would continue, he added, but gave no further detail.\n\nRussian energy minister Alexander Novak told CNN Business that producers would make their own decisions on what to do from April 1.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, settled 9.4% lower at $45.27 a barrel. That was its worst level in nearly three years. It was the worst one-day percentage drop since December 2008. US oil prices settled 10.1% lower at $41.28 on Friday -- the biggest one day percentage drop since November 2014. It was the lowest close since August 2016. OPEC has faced immense pressure to act since oil prices fell into a bear market last month, or 20% below their previous peak, as the coronavirus outbreak destroyed demand for fuel, initially in China. Prices have now fallen 33% since early January. Saudi oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud arrives at the OPEC meeting in Vienna. Research firm IHS Markit predicted Wednesday that oil demand will suffer its steepest decline on record in the first quarter — worse even than during the 2008 global financial crisis — as schools and offices close, airlines cancel flights and a growing number of people hunker down at home. Most of the reduction in demand can be traced to China, where the coronavirus has caused what IHS Markit describes as an \"unprecedented stoppage\" of economic activity. Goldman Sachs told clients this week that OPEC needed to agree to curb production by at least 1 million barrels per day in order to avoid a \"sharp\" sell-off. The investment bank now believes that oil demand will shrink in 2020. Before the coronavirus outbreak, it expected demand to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Thelast week dropped 12.4%, while theplunged 11.5%.\n\nThe Dow also recorded its worst one-day point drop in history on Thursday.\n\n\"If [the market is] priced to perfection and then something indicates that the perfection is a pipe dream, prices will come off,\" said Brad Cornell, emeritus professor of finance at UCLA, of last week's selloff. Prices are much more reasonable now, he added.\n\nBut Monday's rebound was strong. After a sharply higher open and some flipping between gains and losses mid-morning, stocks moved solidly higher.\n\nThe Dow was up 960 points, or 3.8%, on track for its second-best one-day point gain in history. On a percentage basis, Monday stands to be its best day since December 2018.\n\nThe S&P climbed 3.2%, which could its best performance since January last year.\n\nBoth indexes are looking to snap a seven-day losing streak.\n\nAll three indexes entered a correction last week.\n\nInvestors are pushed and pulled into different directions by headlines about the novel coronavirus outbreak. On the one hand, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that the outbreak could significantly slow down global growth.\n\nMeanwhile, hopes for stimulus action from the world's central banks are keeping investors from throwing in the towel. The Bank of Japan said it would provide \"ample liquidity\" to keep financial markets stable and the Bank of England also pledged to do what's necessary for the British economy's stability.\n\nThat said, Fed officials have been speaking out against immediate rate cuts and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that \"the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong.\"\n\nAlthough a Fed rate cut could revive investor sentiment -- at least in the short-term -- market participants are skeptical of how much monetary policy can really do against a global disease outbreak.\n\nCommodities broadly rebounded from last week's selloffs. Gold futures settled up 1.8% at $1,592.30 an ounce, while US oil prices ended 4.4% higher at $46.75 per barrel.\n\nUS Treasury yields, meanwhile, continue to trend lower. Treasuries are a common safe haven investment that receives a lot of buying interest during times of trouble. Bond prices and yields move opposite to each other. The 10-year yield dropped to a all-time low just above 1%.\n\nHowever, the ISM report also highlighted the potential impact the coronavirus outbreak could have on US manufacturing.

I feel very bad in fact.... At the beginning I had a runny nose and a cough. Now I have this continual cold sweat I have a temperature, though not all the time. The past couple of days I have been shivering every night.\"\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe, now 42, was arrested in 2016. The Iranian government accused her of working with organizations allegedly attempting to overthrow the regime. She was sentenced to five years in jail.\n\nHer husband wants her tested immediately\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe transferred from Iranian prison to mental ward, supporters say Zaghari-Ratcliffe called her family on Saturday to update them on her health, the wider conditions in the ward and the apparent reluctance of the prison to test her for the virus. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, believes his wife contracted the coronavirus due \"in large part due to the lack of hygiene materials made available to the prisoners\" in Evin political prison. \"We are concerned by the prison authorities' refusal to test her, and the wider suppression of coronavirus inside the Iranian prison system,\" he said. He called on \"the UK government to insist that Nazanin is tested for coronavirus immediately, and is treated properly.\" There has been an outbreak of coronavirus moving through Iran and human rights organizations have expressed concern that the virus has also struck also struck the prison population At least 43 people have died in Iran and there have been over 500 confirmed cases. CNN has reached out to the Iranian authorities for comment. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the British government is \"urgently seeking information\" from Iranian officials. It called on authorities to immediately allow health professionals into Evin to check on Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Iran offers prisoner swap which could see jailed charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe freed Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 while attempting to return home to London after visiting family with her daughter Gabriella, who was then 22 months old. She was sentenced to five years in jail and her child was placed in the care of her parents. She undertook a hunger strike in an attempt to receive medical treatment, as her husband said that prison guards had asked her to spy on the UK in return for her freedom. Her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, rejects the allegations. In May 2018, Iranian media reported that she was due to face a new trial for \"security-related\" charges. In August 2018, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was treated in hospital after suffering panic attacks, her husband said. The attacks came just days after she returned to prison after she was temporarily released to spend time with her family and daughter.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 989515, "name": "Jason Hanna"}, "body": "(CNN) Although physicians still have no vaccine or cure for the novel coronavirus , health officials and pharmaceutical companies around the world are working hard to develop them.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is spreading globally and has killed at least 2,800 people, the vast majority in mainland China. There have been more than 83,000 global cases, with infections on every continent, except Antarctica.\n\nWhat to know about the coronavirus\n\nMore than 20 potential vaccines aimed at preventing coronavirus disease are in development around the world, the World Health Organization's director-general said Friday.\n\nBut health officials have consistently said it will take at least a year before any vaccine is proven effective and gets necessary approvals for wide distribution.\n\nMeanwhile, several treatments aimed at healing patients or alleviating symptoms already are in clinical trials.\n\nHere are some recent developments in the race for treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus\n\nAn existing antiviral drug, remdesivir, is showing signs of helping to treat this new coronavirus, the World Health Organization has said.\n\nParticipants will receive 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when they're enrolled and another 100 while they're hospitalized for up to 10 days in total. A placebo group will receive a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients, the NIH said.\n\n\"We will know reasonably soon whether it works. And if it does, we will then have an effective therapy to distribute,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday.\n\nOne will be for about 400 patients with severe symptoms. The other will be for about 600 patients with more moderate symptoms. The study will look at the effectiveness of different dosing durations: Patients in both groups will receive the drug for either five or 10 days.\n\nResults of those studies haven't been widely reported, but there are a few reasons to explore HIV antiretroviral drugs. Like HIV, coronaviruses are RNA viruses . And years ago, a combination of HIV drugs and an antiviral drug seemed to help some patients in the 2002-2004 outbreak of SARS, caused by a different coronavirus, according to a study published in the journal Thorax\n\nA number of companies around the world say they've developed potential vaccines after obtaining genetic information about the virus.\n\nBut the reality is that health officials insist these potential vaccines can't be approved for at least a year. Fauci gave CNN this outlook on Wednesday:\n\n-- The first Phase 1 clinical trial could begin in about two months.\n\n-- Such a trial, involving about 45 people, would last about three months. Researchers would try to determine if the candidate is safe and immunogenic.\n\n-- The next phase, involving hundreds of people, would last another six to eight months.\n\nSo, even if a candidate is proven safe and effective, it won't be ready for use this year, Fauci said.\n\nNow, a look at some candidates:\n\nModerna, using messenger RNA, aims to make drugs that direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.\n\nThe technology has had positive results from Phase 1 tests across six different vaccines, one of which is currently in a Phase 2 trial, according to a company spokesperson. But Moderna has yet to produce a proven vaccine with its mRNA platform.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2031759, "name": "Donna Borak"}, "body": "Washington (CNN Business) Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned Congress that the coronavirus could hurt the global economy.\n\n\"We will be watching this carefully,\" Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee, where he delivered his semiannual report to Congress. \"What will be the effects on the US economy? Will they be persistent? Will they be material? That's really the question.\"\n\nPowell refrained from speculating about the potential economic impact of the coronavirus. But noted, \"We know there will likely be some effects on the United States.\"\n\nIn prepared testimony, Powell noted coronavirus could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy . He will testify again before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 am ET on Wednesday.\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus, which has now killed more than 1,000 people , has added uncertainty to the global outlook -- and the US economy -- as companies have shuttered plants and shifted supply chains to contain spread of the infectious disease.\n\nIn late January, Powell described the outbreak as a \" very serious issue ,\" but at the time, he noted the virus was still in its early stages and it remained uncertain how far it would spread and what the macroeconomic effects would be.\n\nThe Fed slashed interest rates three times last year -- in July, September and October -- to a range of between 1.25% and 1.5%. Since then, Powell has signaled the central bank plans to take a wait-and-see approach for this year, a stance he once again reinforced in his testimony to lawmakers.\n\n\"The current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate,\" said Powell. Adding, \"If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Powell sought to thread the needle of sending a reassuring message that the US economy is still in \"a good place,\" but that policymakers would act as needed to continue the longest-running expansion on record, now in its 11th year.\n\nThe Fed chairman has routinely pointed to the country's record low unemployment rate as a benefit to low-and middle-income families, who have been among the last to reap rewards from the economic expansion. He pointed to higher wages for those communities, particularly those with lower-paying jobs.\n\nEven so, Powell cautioned that the country continues to face challenges, including drawing in more workers into the labor force, boosting productivity and reconciling with a ballooning federal deficit.\n\nThe renewed warning by Powell to Congress to get the nation's fiscal house in order comes weeks after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its latest report, projecting that the deficit would widen over the coming decade, reaching a total of $1.7 trillion in 2030.\n\n\"Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn,\" said Powell. \"A more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy's growth over the long term.\"\n\nWith interest rates at historic lows, the Fed's ammunition to rescue the economy is diminished, requiring fiscal policies by Congress to help offset any economic weakness.\n\nThat's significantly higher than what most economists and the Federal Reserve forecast.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-3", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 971456, "name": "Donna Borak"}, "body": "Washington (CNN Business) Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned Congress that the coronavirus could hurt the global economy.\n\n\"We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy ,\" Powell said in his prepared testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, where he is set to deliver his semiannual report to Congress. He will testify again before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 am ET on Wednesday.\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus, which has now killed more than 1,000 people , has added uncertainty to the global outlook -- and the US economy -- as companies have shuttered plants and shifted supply chains to contain spread of the infectious disease.\n\nIn late January, Powell described the outbreak as a \" very serious issue ,\" but at the time, he noted the virus was still in its early stages and it remained uncertain how far it would spread and what the macroeconomic effects would be.\n\nThe Fed slashed interest rates three times last year -- in July, September and October -- to a range of between 1.25% and 1.5%. Since then, Powell has signaled the central bank plans to take a wait-and-see approach for this year, a stance he once again reinforced in his testimony to lawmakers.\n\n\"The current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate,\" said Powell. Adding, \"If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Powell sought to thread the needle of sending a reassuring message that the US economy is still in \"a good place,\" but that policymakers would act as needed to continue the longest-running expansion on record, now in its 11th year.\n\nEven so, Powell cautioned that the country continues to face challenges, including drawing in more workers into the labor force, boosting productivity and reconciling with a ballooning federal deficit.\n\nThe renewed warning by Powell to Congress to get the nation's fiscal house in order comes weeks after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its latest report, projecting that the deficit would widen over the coming decade, reaching a total of $1.7 trillion in 2030.\n\n\"Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn,\" said Powell. \"A more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy's growth over the long term.\"\n\nWith interest rates at historic lows, the Fed's ammunition to rescue the economy is diminished, requiring fiscal policies by Congress to help offset any economic weakness.\n\nThat's significantly higher than what most economists and the Federal Reserve forecast.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak, which has sickened more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560.\n\nLi was hospitalized on January 12 after contracted the virus from one of his patients, and he was confirmed to have the coronavirus on February 1.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Health Organization responded to news of Li's death on Twitter, writing \"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Li Wenliang. We all need to celebrate work that he did on #2019nCoV.\"\n\nThe death toll and number of people infected by the Wuhan coronavirus continues to grow, with no signs of slowing despite severe quarantine and population control methods put in place in central China. This Chinese doctor tried to save lives, but was silenced. Now he has coronavirus The number of confirmed cases globally stood at 28,275 as of Thursday, with more than 28,000 of those in China. The number of cases in China grew by 3,694, or 15%, on the previous day. There have been 565 deaths so far, all but two of which were in China, with one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong. On the same day in December that Li messaged his friends, an emergency notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, informing the city's medical institutions that a series of patients from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market had an \"unknown pneumonia.\" The notice warned: \"Any organizations or individuals are not allowed to release treatment information to the public without authorization.\" In the early hours of December 31, Wuhan's health authorities held an emergency meeting to discuss the outbreak. Afterwards, Li was summoned by officials at his hospital to explain how he knew about the cases, state-run newspaper Beijing Youth Daily reported. Later that day, the Wuhan authorities announced the outbreak and alerted the World Health Organization. US honeymooners are stuck on coronavirus cruise ship -- and they don't know when they'll get to leave On January 3, Li was called to a local police station and reprimanded for \"spreading rumors online\" and \"severely disrupting social order\" over the message he sent in the chat group. Li had to sign a statement -- which CNN has seen a photograph of -- acknowledging his \"misdemeanor\" and promising not to commit further \"unlawful acts.\" He feared he was going to be detained. \"My family would worry sick about me, if I lose my freedom for a few days,\" he told CNN over a text message on WeChat -- he was coughing too much and breathing too poorly to speak over the phone. He was released by police, but returned to work at Wuhan Central Hospital feeling helpless. He said: \"There was nothing I could do. (Everything) has to adhere to the official line.\" On January 10, after unwittingly treating a patient with the Wuhan coronavirus, Li started coughing and developed a fever the next day. He was hospitalized on January 12. In the following days, Li's condition deteriorated so badly that he was admitted to the intensive care unit, and given oxygen support. He later tested positive for coronavirus. On Thursday an official for the World Health Organization expressed sadness at news of Li's death. \"We are very sad to hear the loss of Li Wenliang,\" Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director for the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies program, said when asked about the doctor's death during a daily coronavirus press briefing in Geneva. \"We should celebrate his life and mourn his death along with colleagues,\" Ryan added.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7", "parent": null},

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1974871, "name": "Laura He"}, "body": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Chinese stocks are having their worst day in years as investors finally get a chance to react to the worsening coronavirus outbreak.\n\nTheand the Shenzhen Component Index plummeted more than 8% on their first day of trading after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. They've been closed since January 24.\n\nThe plunge puts Shanghai on pace for its worst day since August 2015's \"Black Monday,\" when global markets were rattled by China slowdown fears . Shenzhen, meanwhile, hasn't recorded a single-day percentage drop this bad since 2007\n\nChina's currency also fell. The onshore yuan sank 1.5%, dropping below seven yuan to one US dollar in its first day back from the holiday break. The yuan also weakened below the seven mark offshore, where it moves more freely and has been trading since last week.\n\nWhile global markets have had several days to weigh the rapid spread of the coronavirus, this is the first chance that mainland China has had to react in more than a week. Before the holiday, the number of cases numbered roughly 800 — now, there are more than 17,000.\n\nMarkets were originally scheduled to reopen last Friday, but the Chinese government extended the holiday as it worked to control the outbreak.\n\nAuthorities knew Monday's shock was likely inevitable. The People's Bank of China said Sunday that it would inject $1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) into the Chinese markets using the purchase of short-term bonds to shore up banks' ability to lend money. The measure will help maintain \"reasonably ample liquidity\" in the banking system and keep currency markets stable, the bank said.\n\nThe net amount of liquidity being injected into the markets is much lower. According to Reuters calculations using central bank data, more than $1 trillion yuan worth of other short-term bond agreements will mature Monday. That brings the net amount of cash flooding into the markets down to 150 billion yuan ($22 billion).\n\nThe central bank will also keep in contact with financial institutions and markets to determine what other policy responses may be necessary, according to Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the central bank.\n\nProtecting China's financial markets and economy is a top priority for the government, which is also bracing for a potentially severe hit to first quarter economic growth. Some economists have said that China's growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter — a decline that could mean $62 billion in lost growth.\n\nAlong with Monday's liquidity kick, top financial and economic regulators have announced dozens of other measures to stabilize China.\n\nFor example, the National Development and Reform Commission — the country's top economic planning agency — said Monday the government would \"go to all lengths\" to make sure that people have what they need to live, including food and other necessities. It also encouraged companies \"that are key to control and prevent the virus\" or are \"of vital importance to the national economy\" to resume production as soon as they can.\n\nAnd the People's Bank of China said Saturday that it would provide money at low interest rates to commercial banks so that those banks could offer cheap loans to companies that make clinical masks, coronavirus testing kits and other types of medical supplies. The central government will also subsidize those special loans.\n\nThe country's stock exchange regulators have also said they would allow companies to delay 2019 annual reports and 2020 quarterly earnings reports if they are affected by the disruption.\n\nMarkets elsewhere in Asia opened lower Monday, too — though their losses were not nearly as dramatic as in China.", "categories":

Symptoms of coronaviruses can range from fever and coughing to kidney failure, and in some cases lead to death.\n\nBut the new coronavirus in Wuhan appears to not be as lethal as MERS, or SARS, which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003.\n\nCurrently, 41 cases of the new coronavirus have been reported in Wuhan, central China's largest city. Five of those patients are in serious condition while 12 have been discharged after treatment, local health authorities said. Other patients are stable and under treatment.\n\nIn total, 763 people who had close contact with the infected patients have been traced. Of those, 644 people have been discharged and 119 are still under medical observation, but no infected cases have been found among them, according to health officials.\n\nThe man who died on Wednesday fell ill on December 31 and was admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital five days later, where his condition worsened.\n\nHealth officials said he suffered from abnormal renal function, inflammation of the heart muscle and severe damage to multiple organ functions. Scans also showed lung damage with possible tuberculosis.\n\nThe first, and the majority, of the infected patients in Wuhan have been traced to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which has been shut down for disinfection since January 1. Wuhan health authorities said on Wednesday that some \"environmental samples\" taken from the market tested positive for the virus.\n\nApart from fish, the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals, just like SARS and MERS.\n\nMeanwhile, two cases have been found outside of China. The virus was confirmed Thursday to have been detected in Japan, a few days after Thailand confirmed its first case of infection. In both cases, the infected people had traveled to Wuhan.\n\nThe outbreak has cast a shadow over celebrations for Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25, and put the rest of Asia on edge. Hundreds of millions of people in China are expected to travel over the course of the new year period, both within the country and overseas.\n\nResearchers have yet to rule out the possibility that the virus could be transmitted from person to person and virologists around the world are now studying its genome sequence shared by Chinese researchers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong's Food and Health officials said there is a \"limited\" chance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, though added that such a possibility could not be ignored.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Watch Level 1 Alert -- the lowest of a three-tier travel health notice that warns visitors to Wuhan to \"be aware and practice usual precautions.\"", "categories":

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects that by June 20 the death toll will reach about 123,000.\n\nThe projection is based on an ensemble forecast of more than a dozen individual forecasts from outside institutions and researchers. The projections show a possible range of 115,400 to 134,800 deaths before the end of next month.\n\n\"This week's national ensemble forecast indicates that the rate of increase in cumulative COVID-19 deaths is continuing to decline. Nevertheless, total COVID-19 deaths are likely to exceed 115,000 by June 20,\" the CDC says on its website.\n\nMeanwhile, as Americans continue reopening their businesses and returning to public spaces after lockdowns to stop the virus's spread, the World Health Organization is still keeping an eye on hotspots in other parts of the world.\n\nAmong them are Russia, Africa, the Americas, some countries in South Asia and a few countries in Europe, said Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead for the WHO's coronavirus response.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1441014, "name": "Mirna Alsharif"}, "body": "But this wasn't just any newspaper article. It was an article documenting Taylor's rescue from a burning New York City apartment by a firefighter in 1983. She was only four years old at the time.\n\nThe picture on the front-page article shows a young Taylor with the man who saved her, Eugene Pugliese.\n\n\"I always knew I came close to losing my life that day,\" Taylor told CNN. \"Without him, I wouldn't be here. I had a second chance at life, thanks to him.\"\n\nToday, Taylor, 40, is an emergency room nurse who lives in Alexandria, Virginia with her husband and two kids. Ever since the incident, she wondered what became of the firefighter who saved her, coming up empty when she searched for him online. Ready to spend two months helping in the fight against Covid-19 at NYU Langone Hospital in Brooklyn, Taylor saw this as an opportunity to finally find him.\n\nDuring one of her shifts, Taylor told a firefighter her story. He called the current captain of FDNY Ladder 20 in Manhattan, who knew exactly who Taylor was looking for. Taylor gave him a call right after her shift and was very happy to hear Pugliese's voice on the other end. \"I wondered about him on 9/11 and hoped I would get the chance to thank him, and I finally did,\" said Taylor. Now 75 years old, Pugliese was \"on cloud nine\" when he got the call from Taylor on Friday. \"The two of us just sat there crying on the phone,\" the Spring Lake, New Jersey resident told CNN, adding that he's had the same article framed on his wall for 25 years now. \"She turned out to be a remarkable woman with a magnificent life.\" While Taylor only remembers bits and pieces of what happened on that December day in 1983, Pugliese, who retired 24 years ago, remembers it vividly. Pugliese was in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan checking water pipes when he was approached by a man who said there was a fire down the block. Pugliese followed the man to a building of loft apartments where he noticed smoke coming out of a sixth floor unit. Upon entering the smokey apartment, Pugliese noticed and rescued a woman who then said her child was inside the apartment. \"She kept screaming, 'My baby!' so I went back in and found a young girl who was unconscious,\" said Pugliese, who then gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until she became conscious. \"I didn't see her ever again after that, but I always wondered about her,\" said Pugliese, who received the Walter Scott Medal for Valor for his rescue of Taylor. Pugliese and Taylor found out they had a lot in common when they reconnected. Taylor enlisted in the United States Army on her 17th birthday, eventually serving in the National Guard as a helicopter pilot before she left to start a family and study to become a nurse. Before Pugliese became a firefighter, he served as a sergeant in the Marine Corps where he fought in the Vietnam War. \"On top of that, we're both die-hard Yankees fans!\" said Taylor Taylor and Pugliese have spoken twice since reconnecting on Friday and hope to meet once it's safe to do so, preferably at a Yankees game. \"I hope to meet her soon, maybe later this summer,\" said Pugliese. \"I'd love to meet her two children and go to a Yankees game together.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB21-1", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

They potentially exposed 140 people to the virus, the officials said.\n\nHealth officials called him on Saturday afternoon -- six days after the haircut -- and told him that he might have been exposed on May 17 and that he needed to quarantine himself until May 31.\n\nChase said they didn't tell him where they believe he might have been exposed.\n\n\"I've dealt with some family emergencies this week and it was kind of like the last bit of bad news to get on a week that was already tumultuous,\" Chase said.\n\n\"So my first thoughts were anger, you know, just a normal reaction, and then I had grief and then it was guilt.\" Chase said his mom's been in the hospital and he had to take his cat to the vet four times in the past week. Chase said he then went into \"proactive mode\" and started listing all the people he may have been in contact with, so that he could notify them that he may have been exposed. Several Atlanta Class of 2020 prep school graduates test positive for coronavirus \"Keep in mind, it was six days before I even knew that I had been exposed to it, so even with my limited interactions with people and practicing social distancing measures, that's a lot of time, especially when you're doing your essential, like everyday life circumstances,\" Chase said. He's hoping to get a coronavirus test on Tuesday or Wednesday, and says he's been taking his temperature twice a day since he got the news. \"As of right now, I'm asymptomatic, but with me being high risk already as a diabetic and having some other immune deficiencies, it does concern me,\" he said, adding that any cough, sneeze or shiver makes him wonder \"Do I have it?\" The Springfield-Greene Health Department said the two stylists worked from the second week of May until last Wednesday. The stylists and their clients wore face coverings. The salon kept excellent records, so health officials were able to contact their clients. Department Director Clay Goddard said the salon has had a deep cleaning and he considers it to be safe. \"The well-being of Great Clips customers and stylists in the salon is our top priority and proper sanitization has always been an important cosmetology industry practice for Great Clips salons. We've closed the salon where the employee works and it's currently undergoing additional sanitizing and deep cleaning,\" the owners of the business said in a statement to CNN affiliate KYTV The incident raises concerns over the increased risk of community spread , as states and cities allow businesses to reopen after weeks of restrictions Missouri has reported 12,476 coronavirus cases and 689 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Chase said he's been catching up on TV shows and doing projects around the house to keep his mind busy, but he hasn't been able to see his mom. \"I'm her primary point of contact, so the ability to reach out to her and see hows she's doing like through that human connection, I'm not able to do because I'm on quarantine now,\" he said.",

(WTVD) -- Having a baby is stressful enough.For Takia Morrison, add on being stuck in the hospital with COVID-19 and being unable to meet her newborn for the first two months of his life.\"It was like I felt complete,\" Morrison said. \"That's what kept the fight in me. I just kept telling myself I have to get back to my children. When she passed him to me and I seen him it was like, 'this is finally here. It's mommy, it's me. I'm here.'\"In early April, 31-year-old Morrison was admitted to the hospital with what they originally thought was just pneumonia before being diagnosed with COVID-19.At the hospital, she had a seizure and needed and emergency c-section and was later transferred to Duke University Hospital for life support.\"When I first woke up I didn't know where I was at,\" she said. \"They told me I was at Duke which definitely put my mind at ease because I knew that Duke was a really good hospital but then I realized I was by myself and I was in the hospital. When I looked at the date on the board I realized it had been days.\"Morrison said what kept her going was knowing her 10-year-old daughter and newborn baby boy needed their mother. Although she was alone in the hospital she says the nurses printed out pictures of her family and hung them in her room.\"For the nurses to take the time to print out the pictures and put them in my room, they almost made me feel at home,\" she said.\"She's sitting there, she has a tube in her mouth hooked up to a ventilator,\" said Craig Rackley, a physician. \"She's got blood flowing out of her body into this external lung, and she's awake and smiling and interacting with us. I think her personality and will was truly admirable and inspiring\".Craig Rackley who treated Morrison says for her to be able to leave the hospital with no oxygen and recovering is a testament to her age and being healthy.\"Most people who need the ECMO that she needed needed it for about seven to 14 days,\" said Rackley. \"She was on it for 23 days. As she continued to improve, her spirits continued to improve. She's truly a tough and impressive young woman.\"After weeks of testing positive for COVID-19, this Monday the test finally read negative and Takia was able to return home to her two children making her appreciate being a mother that much more.\"It's real and it's deadly,\" Morrison said. \"I can't believe people aren't taking it seriously but until you're effected by it you really don't take it serious. But it literally took over my body. I was so happy because it was like I'm making it I'm doing it.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1511106, "name": "Sarah Jorgensen"}, "body": "(CNN) Though Columbia University's commencement this year looked a little different than expected, for graduate Qutaiba Idlbi, the conclusion of his studies carried a special significance that a webcast ceremony stemming from covid-19 restrictions couldn't dampen.\n\n\"I feel like things are finally falling in place,\" Idlbi told CNN.\n\nIdlbi's journey to his bachelor's degree stretches over the course of 12 years and multiple continents, with Syria's political uprising as a backdrop. It concluded this week in New York.\n\n\"It was just all meant for me to come here and finish at Columbia,\" he said.\n\nIdlbi grew up in Damascus, the son of a non-violent political activist. When Idlbi was 15, his father, Yusef, passed away. It was a turning point for Idlbi's own political activity.\n\n\"Knowing about his history after he passed away and my own interest kind of shaped the way I started doing things,\" he said.\n\nIdlbi graduated from high school in 2008. After receiving an associate's degree in finance, he began studying toward a four-year degree at a private Damascus university.\n\nBut soon after Idlbi began his studies in 2011, uprisings began again in Syria.\n\n\"I was involved from the very beginning, organizing demonstrations, delivering aid to besieged areas,\" he said.\n\nIdlbi says he was detained multiple times by Syrian authorities for his political activities. After his second detention, as he tried to prepare for his June 2011 exams, another warrant was issued for his arrest. Idlbi decided then it was time to go into hiding, eventually leaving Syria.\n\nIn 2013, he was invited to the U.S. for a fellowship program run by the State Department. Three years later, still in the U.S. pursuing advocacy work, Idlbi decided it was time for him to continue his studies.\n\n\"Not having my bachelor's -- it was kind of always hovering over my head as this thing I really needed to finish,\" Idlbi said.\n\nHe began his full-time studies in late 2017, and simultaneously worked full time for a U.S. military contractor.\n\n\"It was really kind of like 'Mission Impossible,'\" Idlbi said.\n\nBut when he wrote his papers, he felt he could freely express his opinions.\n\n\"For me, in Syria, much of the whole fight -- the idea of the whole uprising is not to make immediate change, but to allow people to be themselves,\" he said.\n\nNow, Idlbi is studying for the LSAT exam and planning to apply to graduate school later this year either in law or public policy.\n\nBut first, he is taking some time to celebrate in small ways with family and friends, albeit from afar.\n\n\"If it's in a year or two when we have our ceremony, it's fine,\" he said. \"I'm just happy that I'm done with this and to continue moving forward.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB5", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

What New York did was follow what the Republican administration said to do.\n\n\"So don't criticize this state for following the President's policy.\"\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a memorandum on March 13 stating, in part, \"Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.\"\n\nNew York's Department of Health issued a statement Friday saying it was still compiling its data and followed the guidelines from CMS about nursing homes admitting people who had Covid-19. A March 25 order by the state's Department of Health mandated that nursing homes must not deny readmission or admission to people \"solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\" Cuomo announced a new policy on May 10 , saying a hospital cannot discharge a person who is Covid positive to a nursing home.

Every day a little bit of that asset slips away,\" he said, before the NCAA announcement. \"And our hope is we could return to this activity in a healthy way.\" Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said his conference is making similar evaluations with medical advisers. He said there are three states in the Pac-12 that have allowed gyms to open. But he feels athletes would be in a safer and healthier environment if they had access to facilities and supervision on campus. Right now, the Pac-12 is not allowing anyone to work out at schools, with the order ending May 31. Opinion: Sports can't exist without fans in the seats Both commissioners referred to their conference's actions as small steps. The SEC guidance says teams will be allowed to participate under strict supervision in voluntary activities as they prepare to adapt to full training activity needed for their fall sport seasons. \"The safe and healthy return of our student-athletes, coaches, administrators and our greater university communities have been and will continue to serve as our guiding principle as we navigate this complex and constantly evolving situation,\" Sankey said in the news release. The NCAA said its Division I Council decided this week that all athletes can take part in voluntary activities beginning June 1. \"The return of voluntary activity ... shows sensitivity to local, state and regional differences in how Division I campuses are reopening,\" said council Chair M. Grace Calhoun, who is also the athletics director at the University of Pennsylvania. California, New York and Texas governors say professional sports in their states must plan on reopening without fans Organized practices and other required physical activities remain prohibited by the NCAA until July 31. Coaches at Football Bowl Subdivision schools cannot have or work at summer football camps. Coaches at the lower-level Football Championship Subdivision cannot work at camps through June 30. Scott told CNN that if there is progress in the coronavirus numbers, football practice might be able to start in late July. Some teams will play in empty stadiums and some might not, he said. \"Early steps are to safely get student-athletes back to campus, to start the competition, and I think it is going to be some time until we see full stadia and arenas again,\" Scott said.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

We knew so little about it, and how it was spread or how to treat it,\" Akers told the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. The panel heard about the impact of the pandemic on medical workers, first responders, grocery store workers and others.\n\nThe stress of dealing with the new disease was heightened when they went through six months of personal protective equipment in one week.\n\n\"We were -- and still are -- forced to make that supply stretch. This time took a toll on all of us,\" Akers said.\n\nThe doctor said she spent months not seeing her children awake because of the time required to treat patients. She limited her contact with her husband and kids because she was worried her PPE hadn't fully protected her.\n\n\"And I updated my will,\" she said.\n\nThe crisis in Dougherty County began after two funerals were held in late February and March. There were also a downtown festival, a big road race and religious services that were still crowded.\n\n\"The next day, it's when we began seeing people coming to our emergency room who were sick,\" Steiner said. \"Two (people) the first day, six the next day, eight the next day, and it just began to cascade from that point.\"\n\nAbout 20 people who attended at least one of the funerals contracted the virus\n\nOthers were members of the same churches, Steiner said.\n\nFour days later, Gov. Brian Kemp placed a limit on gatherings statewide. He issued a shelter-in-place order on April 2. At that time there were about 4,800 cases In Georgia and 154 deaths, according to the state department of health.\n\nNow there are more than 40,400 cases and at least 1,754 deaths.\n\nThe 141 deaths in the county is topped only by Fulton County and the 396 hospitalizations is behind only four more populous counties in the Atlanta area.\n\n'The virus did not discriminate'\n\nDuring the initial days of the outbreak, hospital staff struggled to keep patients alive, with no guidance about therapies that might be helpful, Akers said.\n\nThere is no cure for Covid-19 and experimental treatments are in the early stages of testing.\n\n\"Some patients died no matter what we did, and we could not change that outcome,\" Akers said. \"It did not matter if they were young or old. This virus did not discriminate.\"\n\nWorkers mourned the loss of patients who took their last breaths without family there. And they cheered for the ones who made it and got to go home, she said.\n\nAkers told the committee that they still need more protective equipment and there needs to be more coordination on a state and federal level.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7", "parent": null}, "score": 0.17,

The status of the third man accused of helping in the escape, George-Antoine Zayek, is unclear.\n\nPeter Taylor had met with Ghosn, who was under strict bail conditions while facing financial crimes in Japan, at least seven times in the months ahead of the escape, according to the documents.\n\nIn late December, Peter Taylor flew into Tokyo and met Ghosn at the Grand Hyatt hotel. Meanwhile, Michael Taylor and Zayek flew into Osaka on a private jet from Dubai. The pair carried with them \"two large black boxes.\"\n\nNissan's profits plunge 83% and the coronavirus threatens its turnaround plans \"The black boxes looked like they were for audio equipment, and Michael Taylor and Zayek told Kansai airport workers that they were musicians,\" the complaint says. Later, on the afternoon of December 29, the four men rendezvoused at the Tokyo hotel. From there, Peter Taylor went to Narita Airport and boarded a flight to China. The other three, including Ghosn, took a train to Osaka, where they regrouped at a hotel. At 8:14 p.m., Ghosn, Michael Taylor, and Zayek arrived at the hotel and entered Room 4609. At 9:57 p.m., Taylor and Zayez emerged from the room with luggage, including the two large boxes, and headed towards the airport. \"There is no image of Ghosn leaving Room 4609. Instead, Ghosn was hiding in one of the two large black boxes being carried by Michael Taylor and Zayek,\" the complaint says. The baggage passed through a security check at the airport without being screened and was loaded on a private jet that departed for Turkey. Two days later, on December 31, Ghosn publicly announced he had escaped to his home country of Lebanon. According to a detention memo, law enforcement moved to arrest the Taylors after discovering that Peter Taylor had booked a plane ticket to Lebanon scheduled to depart on May 20. The court documents revealing the arrests were first highlighted on Twitter by Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the program on extremism at George Washington University Michael Taylor has participated in daring extractions before. The New York Times hired Taylor after their reporter, David Rohde, was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2008, the paper has said. In 1999, Taylor was hired by a North Carolina family to return their daughter who had been stuck in Syria with her three children after fleeing an abusive husband, according to court documents. A security firm that Taylor ran out of Boston, American International Security Corporation, claimed to have conducted \"vulnerability assessments\" for dozens of major international airports, according to an archived version of its website. This story has been updated with additional information about the Taylors.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Midland County after both the Edenville and Sanford Dams breached Tuesday and urged immediate evacuations.\n\n\"If you have a family member or loved one who lives in another part of the state, go there now,\" she said. \"If you don't, go to one of the shelters that have opened across the county.\"\n\nResidents should \"seek higher ground\" as far east and west of the Tittabawassee River as possible, according to the City of Midland website.\n\n\"In the next 12 to 15 hours, downtown Midland could be under approximately nine feet of water,\" Whitmer said in a news conference. \"We are anticipating an historic high water level.\"\n\nMark Musselman brings a chair to the front of his house from the back yard, wading through floodwater, Tuesday, May 19 in Edenville, Michigan The National Weather Service in Detroit said on Twitter a Flash Flood Emergency continues in Midland County through 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. The Tittabawassee River is expected to set a new record Wednesday morning. It currently has a height of 33.22 feet and the current record, which was set September 13, 1986, stands at 33.89 feet. It is forecast to crest at 38.00 feet by 8 a.m. Wednesday before slowly receding. Mark Bone, Chairman of the Midland County Board of Commissioners, said he believes about 3,500 homes and 10,000 people have so far been affected by the evacuation notices. No deaths or injuries have so far been reported, he said. The timing of the dam breaches is especially difficult as officials are trying to take precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, as people gather in the shelters that have been set up. Teams are trying to screen individuals being sheltered, Bone said, and emergency response personnel have plenty of personal protective equipment and are wearing masks. He also said there are masks available for everyone going into the shelters. \"To go through this in the midst of a global pandemic is almost unthinkable. But we are here, and to the best of our ability we are going to navigate this together,\" Whitmer said.

Grimes worked in the jewelry store on their Mediterranean route.\n\nOn March 17, a friend of Grimes and fellow employee tested positive for Covid-19, Grimes told CNN. After consulting with the ship doctor and captain, Grimes said he \"voluntarily went into isolation.\" Fifteen days later, he also tested positive, Grimes said.\n\nGrimes has since been tested seven more times and has received a mixture of positive and negative results, he told CNN.\n\n\"We are very concerned about his mental health,\" Taylor's mother, Ann Grimes, told CNN Monday. \"Last Monday he was sobbing on the phone, saying he wanted to go home,\" she said. \"He had just tested positive.\" Grimes said he hopes his eighth Covid-19 test result will be negative, so he can return to the United States. The American Embassy confirmed to the family it is Italian policy that cruise ship employees may not be released from a ship until they have tested negative in two subsequent tests, Ann Grimes told CNN. \"We don't question that that's the standard,\" Ann Grimes told CNN. \"It's the fact the testing is so sketchy. How can you be in quarantine for 62 consecutive days and still be testing positive?\" Grimes told CNN the cruise ship he was working on disembarked all passengers between March 9 and 10, while around 200 employees remained on board. Once he tested positive, Grimes was moved to a guest cabin with a balcony until, \"with no warning, no preparation,\" he was given full protective gear to wear and taken to a local hospital to be tested, Grimes said. He was in full protective gear from about 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time, Grimes said. He was then loaded in the back of an ambulance and dropped off at a hospital ship with \"with no heads up,\" he said. \"I then had a mental breakdown,\" he said of his realization he wasn't going back to the cruise ship. He has since been staying in a small crew-like cabin on a hospital ship that is being used to treat the local population who have tested positive for Covid-19 but do not require hospitalization. Grimes says he tested negative Saturday, his seventh test to date. He's now awaiting the results of an eighth test, hoping that it will be negative. He would then be able to fly back to the United States via commercial airline, he said. \"The faster you get me to the US, the better,\" Grimes said. \"I don't care where you send me.\" CNN has reached out to MSC Cruises for comment.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-12", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB20-12",

Bars, wine tasting rooms and craft breweries can open at a 25% capacity, the governor said. Those capacity limits do not apply to outdoor areas that maintain safe distances, Abbott said.\n\n\"Today, tomorrow and every day going forward is one day closer to medical discoveries that will help treat and protect people from getting Covid-19,\" Abbott said. \"Until that day comes, our focus is to keep you safe while also restoring your ability to get back to work, to open your businesses, to pay your bills, to put food on your tables.\"\n\nTexas, one of the first states to reopen, on Saturday saw its highest single-day increase in positive Covid-19 cases yet, 1,801, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nAt the news conference Monday, Abbott attributed the spike to increased testing. The percentage of positive tests has gone down, he said. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, though, attributed the rising numbers at least in part to the state's reopening of businesses. \"Well, more than likely what you saw in the cases jumping in the past few days that we've reported is a change in policy with respect to the reopening of parts of our economy, a couple weeks ago,\" the mayor told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" on Monday. More businesses, camps and schools may open soon The state reported just 11 new deaths from Covid-19 on Monday, the lowest new daily death toll since March 31, when the state had only four fatalities, according to the health department's data. Various businesses including bowling alleys, bingo halls and skating rinks, as well as rodeos and aquariums may also all open at 25% capacity on May 22, Abbott said. On May 31, some professional sports can apply to the Department of State Health Services for approval to hold events without spectators, including golf, outdoor racing, baseball, softball, tennis, football and basketball. Youth sports camps and programs such as Little League also will be allowed to open May 31. Parents will be allowed to watch, as long as social distancing is followed, according to Abbott. Summer camps and other daytime and overnight camps will also be allowed to open. On June 1, school districts are allowed to open for summer school classes as long as distancing practices are followed, Abbott said. Some counties to open later Several counties with higher amounts of infections and cases or which have low hospital capacity will not be starting this second phase of reopenings until May 29. Those counties are El Paso, Moore, Potter, Randall and Deaf Smith, the governor said. Abbott ended Texas' stay-at-home order May 1, allowing businesses such as retail stores, malls, restaurants and theaters to reopen that day at 25% capacity. On May 8, cosmetology salons, barbershops, hair salons, nail salons, tanning salons and swimming pools were able to open, following certain guidelines. Texas had 48,640 total Covid-19 cases as of Monday afternoon, with 1,344 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1034861, "name": "Katelyn Polantz"}, "body": "(CNN) Court challenges to the criminal cases of Michael Flynn and Roger Stone could stretch well into the summer, according to separate court filings Monday, signaling the former Trump advisers will likely face drawn-out battles in court.\n\nFlynn and Attorney General William Barr have been pushing the court for Flynn's exoneration , while Stone has been trying to avoid reporting to prison. In both instances, the federal judiciary hasn't budged.\n\nThe two criminal cases for weeks have been almost mirror-image hotbeds of political controversy, with critics of President Donald Trump and thousands of former prosecutors accusing the Justice Department of going easy on the Trump associates for political reasons . The back-to-back announcements on Monday highlight how each defendant is expected to face a lengthy court process as they fight their convictions.\n\nThe Flynn case -- in which a judge made a stunning recent move to bring in an outside lawyer -- may not hold arguments until at least mid-June over the Justice Department's request to drop the case and about whether Flynn perjured himself in court.\n\nFlynn, Trump's first national security adviser, previously pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his policy discussions with Russia during the Trump transition, but now claims he is innocent.\n\nLast week, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan appointed John Gleeson, an esteemed former federal judge and New York-based private attorney, to weigh in on the case. Gleeson told the court on Monday he would like to submit his arguments against dropping the Flynn case and on the question of perjury by June 10.\n\nAfter that, the Justice Department and Flynn's legal teams should have time to respond and Sullivan could hold oral arguments, Gleeson said in his first formal request in the Flynn case Monday. That process generally takes six weeks or more in court -- though it can move faster or slower depending on the judge.\n\nSullivan didn't set a timeline when he appointed Gleeson to examine the case independently, and he hasn't said yet if he'll follow the suggested schedule, or indicated how long resolving Flynn's legal tangles might take.\n\nAs for Stone, who appealed his sentence after a judge denied him a new trial this spring, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said Monday it wouldn't consider his challenges before September.\n\nStone, who advised Trump in 2016 and is a longtime friend of the President's, was convicted by a jury of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering about his efforts in 2016 to protect Trump. He is set to serve 40 months in prison , though he's appealed his sentence , maintaining his jury was biased.\n\nDavid Schoen, Stone's appellate attorney, said his team doesn't yet know when he would have to report to prison. It's up in the air especially with the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused prisons to reduce their populations especially of older, nonviolent offenders.\n\nStone's team says it plans to ask both the appellate judges and District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who sentenced him, to put his prison sentence on hold. But that hasn't happened yet.\n\nWritten arguments in the Stone case will be finished September 8, and the court will hold a to-be-scheduled hearing for oral arguments after that, the appeals court said on Monday.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-5", "parent":

Hard.\"\n\nShelton began making films in her mid-30s, Kersh said, and went on to write and direct eight feature films in the span of 14 years. Among her films, she directed \"Humpday\" and \"Your Sister's Sister,\" both starring Mark Duplass, as well as \"Outside,\" with Edie Falco.\n\nShelton has dozens of credits to her name, including most recently directing several episodes of Hulu's \"Little Fires Everywhere,\" starring Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington , on which she also served as an executive producer. She also directed episodes of \"Mad Men,\" \"GLOW,\" \"Shameless,\" \"New Girl\" and \"The Mindy Project,\" among others. \"I'm so devastated to hear about Lynn Shelton's passing,\" Witherspoon tweeted. \"I'm in complete shock that this vibrant, talented, and soulful filmmaker is no longer with us. Lynn was so passionate about our show.\" Duplass tweeted Shelton's \"boundless creative energy and infectious spirit were unrivaled. She made me better. We butted heads, made up, laughed, pushed each other. Like family. What a deep loss.\" We lost our dear friend Lynn Shelton. We made so many things together. I wish we had made more.

(WTVF) — A Murfreesboro woman hasn't been able to hug or kiss her husband for 50 days after COVID-19 sent him to the hospital in serious condition.\n\nCynthia Wilson got to see her 62-year-old husband in person for the first time this week since he was admitted to Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital for COVID-19 almost eight weeks ago.\n\nEdgar Wilson is now recovering at a rehab facility in Nashville where he's well enough to finally see his wife even it's from the window.\n\nCynthia could wave and blow kisses, and make phone calls while seeing him from the parking lot. It's still not safe for her to visit him in his room. Throughout this time, Edgar tested positive for the virus seven times, prohibiting him from coming back home.\n\n\"We've never been apart no longer than five days. That's the longest ever we've been apart in 23 years,\" Cynthia told NewsChannel 5. \"The first thing I want to do is hug him and I just want to touch him.\"\n\nEdgar first displayed symptoms of cough and a fever in late March, but quickly had to be on a ventilator the next day. This grandfather was transferred to Saint Thomas West and remained on a ventilator in a medically induced coma for nearly a month.\n\nCynthia said because of his nurses, she got to see him through video messenger while attached to tubes and a machine. He remained in the ICU until April 26 before he was moved to the rehab center.\n\nHis wife said he came out of the coma thinking he was in an accident at first.\n\n\"He's never been sick or been in the hospital a day in his life,\" Cynthia said. \"It's just scary because I've seen what this virus can do. It's totally different when it's at your doorstep.\"\n\nCynthia said Edgar has to take another test on Monday. If it comes back negative, he must take a second test 24 hours later to confirm it twice. If it comes back positive, that means at least another 10 days in isolation.\n\nBrian Todd of the Metro Public Health Department stated the city follows CDC guidelines on when to consider a person is cleared of COVID-19. After 10 days, a patient must be feeling better and must be fever free for the last 72 hours. They also can't have taken any fever reducing medicines during the last 72 hours such as Tylenol or ibuprofen.\n\nEven if Edgar gets to leave, Cynthia admitted there are still concerns if he may get the virus again. She personally felt crippled by the virus and can't do day-to-day activities aside from going to work.\n\nCynthia said not if but when he leaves the facility, she will hold a parade for him.",

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2003489, "name": "Giulia Mcdonnell"}, "body": "When he saw the \"2020 Grad\" signs on their lawns, US Postal Service worker Josh Crowell knew he wanted to lift the spirits of these graduating high school seniors who wouldn't be able to walk across the stage with their classmates because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe started leaving $5 Dunkin' Donuts gift cards in some of their mailboxes.\n\n\"$5 isn't much, but it's something so that the kids can get out of the house and go get a donut and an iced coffee,\" Crowell, 39, told CNN. He also leaves a hand-written note with the gift card, he said, congratulating the 2020 graduate, signing off the note as \"your mailman Josh.\"\n\nSo far, Crowell, who delivers mail on routes near Concord, New Hampshire, has handed out at least 25 gift cards. But he keeps more cards in a lunchbox that he takes with him in case he sees more 2020 graduation signs.\n\nNew Hampshire announced school closures for the remainder of the school year in mid-April, but the state has not yet announced a decision regarding the plan for schools in the fall of 2021.\n\nThe state is under a modified stay-at-home order, called \"Stay at Home 2.0\" which is in effect until May 31. \"You are healthier at home. We want you to stay at home,\" New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said at a recent news conference. On May 11, barbers and hair salons in New Hampshire were allowed to reopen, with certain social distancing restrictions. Retail shops also opened on May 11 to customers but are limited 50% occupancy. Restaurants can reopen on May 18, but only with outdoor seating options. Crowell, however, has continued working throughout the pandemic since he is considered an \"essential worker\" as a postal service worker under Sununu's Emergency Order No. 17. Crowell started working for the post office in November of 2019, and his routes usually run through towns including Concord, Bow and Loudon. He's gotten various notes from seniors responding to his gift cards. Many of the notes he received thank him for his kindness and for his continued work as an essential worker during the pandemic, Crowell said. One of the thank you cards that Crowell received reads in part: \"This year has not been easy for most, but I think being able to make someone's day is important. ... Thank you for being an essential worker, it means a lot.\" Crowell has received various notes from high school seniors thanking him for his kindness. Crowell has two daughters, so he knows how important it is for seniors to graduate on the stage alongside their classmates, he told CNN. His younger daughter graduated high school in 2018. \"She had some issues in school learning-wise so she struggled,\" Crowell said. \"To know that she was able to graduate and walk across the stage and get her diploma was very meaningful for her and for me. To know that the students for 2020 are not going to be able to do that is hard and sad.\" Crowell uses his personal money to buy the gift cards, he said. \"I'm not very well-off myself, but I look at it as, if I put a smile on somebody's face, then I will do it.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB9-7", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1747026, "name": "Bethany Hines"}, "body": "(CNN) Gabrielle Pierce cried for a nearly a week when she learned her college graduation was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I was so upset. I was sad,\" Pierce told CNN.\n\nXavier University of Louisiana notified graduates mid-March about the change. Like most schools, they plan to host a virtual commencement instead.\n\n\"I actually finished December of 2019. They (Xavier University) only have one commencement each year,\" Pierce said. \"So I had to wait until spring of 2020 to walk.\"\n\nPierce had worked so hard over the years, earning a bachelor's degree in public health science with a minor in biology. For her, the thought of not walking across the stage was crushing.\n\n\"I was like, 'I can't believe this is happening after waiting so long. I deserve to walk,'\" Pierce said.\n\nHer father, Torrence Burson, believed so, too.\n\n\"I was really devastated. Just to see your baby crying -- knowing that she worked so hard and stayed the course. She did everything right. I said, 'You're going to walk across somebody's stage, even if I have to build you one,'\" Burson said with a laugh.\n\nThat night, Burson said a prayer before bed, and the idea for a graduation at the family's home in Memphis, Tennessee, came in a dream.\n\n\"I ran it by my wife and first she said that I was crazy, but then she said she liked the idea.\"\n\nBurson had about six weeks to plan. He called around town to reserve a stage, podium, backdrop and photographer.\n\n\"Gabrielle never saw anything until she came out to walk,\" he shared.\n\n\"I know when he plans stuff, it's usually big,\" his daughter said. \"But I didn't think that this was going to be as big as it was.\"\n\nBurson carefully planned the event, even having Pierce walk out to the traditional graduation song \"Pomp and Circumstance.\" Guest speakers included the family pastor and Pierce's aunt, who spoke about her during the ceremony.\n\nNearly 40 people attended, wearing masks and practicing social distancing. It lasted 45 minutes.\n\n\"At that moment, I didn't have any worries. I was speechless. To see my baby walk across the stage and all her friends, family, neighbors and people that we don't even know stopped in the street to witness this. I couldn't ask for anything better.\"\n\n\"Everything was just so perfect. Everyone was there to see me,\" Pierce recalled. \"I felt so loved. It was just great.\"\n\nAnd this is just the beginning for the graduate as she plans to go back to school to earn master's and doctorate degrees.\n\n\"My end goal is work for the CDC as an epidemiologist,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, she has a few encouraging words to share with other 2020 graduates.\n\n\"Stay strong. This is not the end for us. We have so much more to go through -- to get to. The world is our oyster. There's no stopping us.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6-6", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1038263, "name": "Rebekah Riess"}, "body": "The Legislature authorized the state House and Senate to file the lawsuit last week and it was filed in a state court of claims Wednesday morning.\n\n\"The Legislature did not approve an extension of the state emergency declaration and as such we expected the declaration to end,\" Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said in a statement.\n\n\"Instead, we saw the governor ignore the law, unilaterally extend the emergency, and write new executive orders. If left unchecked, the governor could extend her authority indefinitely. Michigan citizens cannot wait that long for a path forward to regain their lives and their livelihoods.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Whitmer's office for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit comes the week after Whitmer signed the executive orders that terminated the old state of emergency and put in place a new one through May 28. The Democratic governor has continued to hold steady on slowly reopening the state amid growing calls to relax social distancing measures and jump start the state's economy. \"We extended our hand to the governor last week and offered several times to work with her to improve the state's response and improve the status quo that is hurting so many people. She rejected that offer and chose to go it alone, in a way that is against the law,\" Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield alleged. \"We have to stand up for the people we represent, their concerns and their legal rights. This lawsuit will bring everyone back to the table and ensure a better, bipartisan solution to the Covid-19 pandemic.\" Along with their complaint, the leaders filed a motion for immediate declaratory judgment, arguing that \"the Governor is acting pursuant to emergency powers that she does not have while eviscerating laws that she is charged to enforce. She has chosen to regulate every aspect of nearly 10 million lives with no consent or input from the people's representatives, whose assistance the Governor publicly disdains. \"No statute or constitutional provision empowers the Governor to declare a statewide, indefinite state of emergency and then rely on that declaration to exercise unfettered lawmaking authority,\" motion continued. Whitmer has faced repeated demonstrations against her closure orders, including at her home. Last week, protesters with firearms descended on Michigan's state Capitol building to pressure the governor to issue more relaxed measures. But she has been outspoken in her beliefs that the country has to listen to medical professionals. Last month, Whitmer extended Michigan's stay-at-home order through May 15, which was set to expire April 30. The new order aimed to ease the state's stay-at-home guidelines, which are among the strictest in the nation, while also mitigating the spread of the virus. Under the new guidelines, individuals would be allowed to move between residences and to enjoy outdoor activities like motorized boating and golfing. The order also saw new guidelines for allowing certain businesses like landscapers, lawn-service companies and bike repair shops to reopen.

Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had issued an executive order in March moving the primary from its originally scheduled date of April 28 to June 23.\n\nThe preliminary injunction, granted by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, came in response to a lawsuit last week from former presidential candidate and current CNN contributor Andrew Yang and several New Yorkers who had hoped to serve as his delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"I'm glad that a federal judge agreed that depriving millions of New Yorkers of the right to vote was wrong,\" Yang said in a statement. \"I hope that the New York Board of Elections takes from this ruling a newfound appreciation of their role in safeguarding our democracy.\"\n\nThe New York Board of Elections must \"reinstate to the Democratic primary ballot those presidential and delegate candidates who were duly qualified as of April 26, 2020, and to hold the primary election on June 23, 2020,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe New York State Board of Elections declined to comment on the ruling Tuesday night. In her ruling, Torres wrote that Yang and the would-be delegates had \"made a clear and substantial showing of likelihood of success on the merits of their claim\" that the action by the state board had violated their constitutional rights. In April, New York became the first state to cancel its presidential primary over coronavirus fears, New York State Board of Elections co-chair Douglas Kellner told CNN at the time. Kellner, one of the Democratic commissioners on the board, said that the decision came after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign earlier that month, which \"basically rendered the primary moot.\" \"At a time when the goal is to avoid unnecessary social contact, our conclusion was that there was no purpose in holding a beauty contest primary that would marginally increase the risk to both voters and poll workers,\" he added. But the decision saw strong blowback from the Sanders camp. Sanders campaign adviser Jeff Weaver at the time called the decision \"an outrage, a blow to American democracy, and must be overturned by the (Democratic National Committee).\" Weaver said that the state had violated its approved delegate selection plan and should lose its delegates to the national convention if \"this is not remedied.\" Multiple states have postponed their primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has significantly altered the daily lives of Americans.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 945322, "name": "Marianne Garvey"}, "body": "While she says she misses the \"electricity\" of \"The Wendy Williams Show\" studio audience, Williams believes her years spent as a radio host prepared her well for talking into the ether. As she continues to host her syndicated talk show from home amid the coronavirus pandemic, that's the only skill she really needs.\n\n\"If it wasn't for radio, I could not do this quarantine thing from home thing properly,\" Williams tells CNN.\n\n\"I've so enjoyed this 11, going on 12 years, of doing the talk show with the studio and hundreds of people and clapping and the immediate response. I've so enjoyed that, but it is much easier for me as a host to be here at home, with no audience, because it's always been about description. You know, I've been a radio host longer than I've been a TV host, so yes, right. Thank God for radio.\"\n\nAt first, Williams was reluctant to film the show at home, she says, because she considers her home space sacred. Plus, she wasn't digging the look of seeing other TV personalities in their homes. \"Looking disgusting,\" she laughs. \"I'm just saying.\"\n\n\"The whole apartment is my office as far as I'm concerned [now],\" Williams says. \"But no, you know, when quarantine first got started, I was reluctant to do it because I always feel that I give so much of myself when I do the show for the last 11 plus years, that I want a place that I can call my own.\" Eventually, with the prompting of her production team, Williams gave in. The same camera man is allowed in each morning to film Williams in her kitchen, and she says he and her team are in charge of all the \"buttons and wires,\" because she has zero interest in working the equipment. He rings her bell, films the show and then it goes to post-production. All she has to do is show up in her own kitchen and talk. \"I have the same person come over every single day. He's on time. He flips the switches, he sits over there, away from me. We get it done,\" she says. \"Then my computer shows a whole gang of people from production.\" As for wardrobe and glam, Williams has been sifting deep though her own closet, choosing between colorful robes and comfortable tops. She is good at doing her own hair and makeup, she says, another skill she attributes to her time in radio. \"I've got a closet galore, right?\" she says. \"I pull out a robe and you know, sit in my chair and I've got my stuff around me and I'm a natural. It's like I am born to do exactly what I'm doing. So, this is not a stretch for me.\" Williams says she's in a positive place these days, and credits her production staff for helping keep the show on the air. \"We work so well as a team,\" she says. \"I'm enjoying this process.\" When she's not working, Williams says, she loves to people watch from her window with binoculars, orders takeout and hangs with her two rescue cats, Chit Chat and My Way, who run when they see the camera. She's content, but looking forward to getting back to the studio. \"Until I get the thumbs up, I'm not leaving the house. I enjoy my surroundings. I enjoy my apartment. I've got plenty of cat food, kitty litter, I've got plenty of food here. My cable works, you know, it smells beautiful. It looks beautiful in here. I have a perfect view of everything,\" she says. But when the world gets up and running, she adds, \"I will probably be the one to sleep over in my office the night before, and I will be the one to unlock the door and turn on the lights and welcome everyone back.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB1-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB1-4", "parent":

The official death toll in the US currently stands at more than 70,000, according to figures collected by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nInternational comparisons are not flawless because countries count deaths in different ways and with varying levels of accuracy.\n\nRaab said at the daily UK government press briefing that a \"real verdict on how countries have done\" will not be fully available until after the pandemic is over.\n\nBut Italy and Spain -- previously considered Europe's two hardest-hit countries -- are also significantly further along in their outbreaks than the UK and are already tentatively lifting some lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe development comes just days before Johnson is due to address the country on Sunday.\n\nJohnson is expected to announce the nation's next steps, with widespread reports in the UK media this week of how the country will ease its lockdown measures.\n\n\"It's now clear that the second phase will be different. We will need to adjust to a new normal,\" Raab said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable,\" he added. \"But we need to be under no illusions, the next stage won't be easy.\"\n\nBut even the most recent government figures only tell a partial story. More data, released earlier on Tuesday, indicated that the true number of deaths by late April far exceeded that which was reported daily by ministers.\n\nEngland's Office of National Statistics (ONS) said there were 29,998 deaths in which Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the period ending on April 24, or two days later in Scotland. That includes suspected coronavirus-related deaths in all settings, including care homes.\n\nIts figure far exceeds the death toll of 20,732 announced by the government at the same point. At the time, the government did not include patients who died from Covid-19 outside of hospitals.\n\nThe UK government last week started including data on deaths outside hospitals in cases where people had tested positive for Covid-19. Previously, the UK-wide figures were only for hospital deaths.\n\nIt did claim to reach its own target of conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but only for two days and with the help of thousands of tests that were mailed out to households but not completed. The number of tests carried out daily subsequently dropped to 84,000 on Monday and 85,000 the day before.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Over the weekend, parks in New York City and Atlanta drew crowds as residents began venturing out of their homes. In the city of Miami Beach, more than 7,300 warnings were issued to people who weren't wearing face covers, while more than 470 warnings were given to those who failed to practice social distancing.\n\nForgetting about social distancing measures too quickly can result in a rebound, Fauci says. And that's highly likely with a virus that he says can spread \"like wildfire.\"\n\n\"It has a phenomenal capability and efficiency in spreading from person to person,\" Fauci said Monday. \"This virus has enormous capabilities of spreading like wildfire. We know that.\"\n\nCalifornia was one of the states where crowds gathered over the weekend -- thousands of protesters descended on the state's Capitol and an Orange County beach to protest social distancing orders from the governor.\n\nOn Monday, the governor announced retail shops in the state -- including clothing stores, florists and book shops -- can begin to reopen on Friday, after health officials said the state was meeting important metrics including sufficient test and tracing capacity.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he didn't think his city would reopen this week, saying Monday that despite the governor's announcement, different parts of the state may see different timelines for reopening.\n\nIn Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the lockdown will continue \"until at least May 15,\" warning that reopening the state too soon could lead to a second shutdown.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has laid out a phased reopening approach for the state, said Monday the numbers in Kentucky are \"really steady\" even with an increase in testing.\n\nWhen he was asked why the state had forgone the recommended benchmark of seeing a 14-day decline in cases before beginning to reopen he said, \"I will tell you, I never thought we'd be plateaued for three weeks, that's a great thing with more testing.\"\n\nAnd in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves took a more aggressive approach, releasing new guidelines that go into effect this week.\n\nThose include allowing outdoor gatherings of up to 20 people.\n\nSaying he knows the virus doesn't do well in the sun or heat, he added, \"to be outdoors is about the safest place you can be.\"\n\nThe governor's plan also allows dining service in restaurants -- as long as the institutions follow guidelines provided by the state, including a mandatory deep cleaning.\n\n\"I don't want to wait if there are steps that we believe we can safely take now to ease the burden on Mississippians fighting this virus,\" he said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-4", "parent":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 963639, "name": "Jennifer Hansler"}, "body": "Egyptian-American Reem Desouky was released from prison on Sunday, according to the Freedom Initiative, an organization that advocated on her behalf. She and her son Moustafa returned to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, late Sunday night.\n\n\"We at the Freedom Initiative and her family and friends are ecstatic about her return home and would like to extend our appreciation to the members of Congress, civil society organizations, the State Department and the Vice President's office for championing Ms. Desouky's case,\" the organization said in a statement released Monday. \"Her release is welcomed progress and a step forward in the right direction that we hope is built on for the release of others.\"\n\nDesouky spent 301 days imprisoned, according to the Freedom Initiative. She was jailed after being detained and interrogated upon her arrival at the Cairo airport in July 2019. At the time, Moustafa released a series of videos pleading for anyone, including President Donald Trump, to help secure his mother's freedom.\n\nThe US State Department welcomed the news of Desouky's release.\n\nOther American citizens and permanent residents, including Khaled Hassan, Mohamed Amashah, Ola Al-Qaradawi and Hosam Khalaf, remain imprisoned in Egypt -- their situation made all the more vulnerable by the coronavirus outbreak. Hassan, a limousine driver who had been living in New York, was detained in secret and forcibly disappeared for four months starting in January 2018 and attempted suicide in July 2019, according to Human Rights Watch. Amashah, a US-Egyptian medical student, was detained in March 2019 on his way home from class in Cairo. He began a hunger strike in May 2020. Al-Qaradawi and Khalaf, both US legal permanent residents, have been detained in Egypt since June 2017. In February, their daughter Aayah Khalaf told CNN she was gravely worried about them. Aayah Khalaf was among several family members who wrote to Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late April, urging the release of their loved ones -- US citizens, permanent residents and those with \"strong ties to the US\" -- from Egyptian detention. \"We are writing to you to express our deep concern over the treatment of our family members in Egypt and the risk to their lives from Covid 19,\" they said in their letter. \"Time is of the essence and action is required now before the disease spreads beyond the ability of the Egyptian authorities to control.\" In a statement Monday, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that the Egyptian government had suspended all prison visits due to the risk of coronavirus, but \"the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has requested and received permission to speak with incarcerated U.S. citizens via telephone until we can resume in person visits.\" \"As Secretary Pompeo and other officials have noted, we expect that all governments around the world will keep detained U.S. citizens safe and provide appropriate consular access at all times, but even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she said. In January, American Mustafa Kassem died of heart failure in the midst of a hunger strike after more than six years in an Egyptian prison. On Saturday, a 24-year-old Egyptian filmmaker died in prison after spending two years in pre-trial detention on accusations of directing a video mocking President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, his lawyer, Ahmad El Khawaga, told CNN.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-1", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-1", "parent":

If verified, this finding would show that the virus was already circulating in Europe at that time -- well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy.\n\n\"Covid-19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country,\" the team at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine in Saint-Denis wrote in a study published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.\n\nThe first official reports of Covid-19 in France were reported on Jan. 24, in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan, China.\n\nIntensive care specialist Dr. Yves Cohen and his hospital colleagues wrote that they decided to check the records of earlier patients, in case the virus had been spreading undetected.\n\nResearchers in the US have also started finding evidence that the virus was infecting and killing people earlier than the country's first reported cases. The French team looked at people admitted to the hospital with flu-like illness between December 2 and January 16 who were not ultimately diagnosed with influenza. They tested frozen samples from those patients for coronavirus. \"One sample was positive taken from a 42 year old man born in Algeria, who lived in France for many years, and worked as a fishmonger,\" the team wrote . \"His last trip was in Algeria during August 2019.\" The man had not been to China, and one of his children had also been sick, also, the team reported.

Moreover, the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December, 2019,\" they wrote. Europe did not start reporting cases of coronavirus until January. In Italy, the European country hit hardest by the virus, the first two cases were reported on Jan 31, in two Chinese tourists in Rome.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1153389, "name": "Jeremy Diamond"}, "body": "President Donald Trump claimed Sunday that the US intelligence community \"did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January\" and that \"they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.\"\n\nTrump said Sunday night that he was first briefed about coronavirus on January 23 and indicated the US intelligence agencies would be issuing a statement in the coming days.\n\n\"On January 23, I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import. In other words it wasn't, 'Oh we gotta do something, we gotta do something.' It was a brief conversation and it was only on January 23,\" Trump said during a Fox News town hall.\n\nWhile Trump claims he was told that \"there could be a virus coming in,\" that January 23 briefing came three days after the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States. The President was also briefed by Health and Human Services Secretary Secretary Alex Azar about the threat of the coronavirus during a January 18 phone call, according to multiple reports. Trump also said that at the time, the US intelligence community was not \"competently run.\" \"And the intelligence agencies, which have now -- now, now -- because before they weren't, which are now very competently run with some great people....the intelligence agencies will tell you that tomorrow,\" Trump said Sunday. While claiming that he was only briefed about the coronavirus in late January , Trump did not address why he continued to downplay the threat of the virus in January, February and March. How Trump has broken the polls As late as March 9, Trump continued to downplay the threat of coronavirus, comparing it to the flu despite public health experts' warnings against such a comparison. Trump also falsely claimed in his tweet that those allowed into the US from China \"were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens.\" Passengers returning to the United States from China were not tested at airports, though there had been some basic screening and a request that those passengers self-quarantine for 14 days. Trump's claims join a list of deflections throughout the pandemic as the President has sought to combat negative perceptions about the US response. By Sunday, more than 1.1 million people in the US were infected with the virus, and more than 67,000 had died, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University", "categories": [{"confident":

South Koreans did return fire so far as we can tell there was no loss of life on either side,\" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nA US official told CNN on Saturday that the current analysis from multiple threads of intelligence is that the photos published by North Korean state media showing Kim at a fertilizer plant opening are legitimate. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the photograph or video or the date it was shot.\n\nQuestions regarding Kim's health were initially raised after he missed the celebration of his grandfather's birthday on April 15. He had been seen four days before that at a politburo meeting, according to North Korean state media, KCNA. CNN previously reported that the United States was monitoring intelligence that Kim was \"in grave danger after a surgery,\" according to a US official. Another US official told CNN Monday that the concerns about Kim's health are credible, but their severity was hard to assess. On Sunday, Pompeo was tight-lipped regarding Kim's health. \"We don't know why he chose to miss that moment. We know there've been other extended periods of time where Chairman Kim's been out of public view as well, so it's not unprecedented. So there's not much I can share with you other than we've seen the same images from yesterday that the world saw. It looks like Chairman Kim is alive and well,\" Pompeo said. \"Regardless of any of that, our mission is, remains the same -- to convince the North Koreans to give up their nuclear weapons, to verify the same and to then create a brighter future for the North Korean people.\" Asked if he was gravely ill during the period where Kim was out of public view, Pompeo would only say that \"I just can't say anything about that.\" He also refused to say whether the US had any information about whether Kim's situation was connected to Covid-19 or a heart issue.", "categories": [{"confident": true,

Moscow, the country's worst-hit city, accounts for more than a half of total cases.\n\nOn Thursday, as the number of cases passed 100,000, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin appeared on state television informing President Vladimir Putin by video conference that he'd tested positive for the virus. That came a day after Mishustin said it was \"impossible to give an exact date\" for lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Russia, including reopening the country's borders.\n\nOn Saturday, a Chinese city on the border with Russia issued an emergency epidemic prevention notice closing all dine-in restaurants \"until further notice,\" according to China's state-run CCTV.\n\nThe move by Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province came as other Chinese provinces began to lift lockdown measures. Heilongjiang has seen a recent spike in locally transmitted coronavirus cases. Chinese health authorities recently traced dozens of cases to a single flight that arrived in Shanghai from Moscow on April 10. A wave of cases in the city of Suifenhe, on the border with Russia's Far East, were attributed in large part to Chinese nationals returning from Russia. Last week, Russia extended its isolation period through May 11. \"The daily increase in cases has relatively stabilized but this mustn't calm us down, the situation is still very serious,\" Putin said. \"The peak is not behind us, we are about to face a new and grueling phase of the pandemic... the deadly threat of the virus remains.\" The Russian Defense Ministry reported an outbreak among its personnel, cadets and civilian employees. Reports have emerged of cases at military academies across the country, including among troops who took part in the Moscow rehearsals for the May 9 Victory Day parade. Back in March, Putin radiated confidence about his government's response to a growing global crisis, reassuring his citizens that the situation was \"under control\" thanks to early intervention measures. On April 1, the Russian President played the role of international rescuer , dispatching a planeload of medical supplies to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. But by April 13, the mood had changed . \"We have a lot of problems,\" Putin said in a video conference. \"There is nothing to boast about, and we must not let our guard down, because in general, as

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2555906, "name": "Jessi Esparza"}, "body": "(CNN) It's a popular argument heard at protests denouncing state shutdowns , fueled by those who say news outlets are overreacting to coronavirus:\n\nThe flu kills more people than coronavirus. Why shut down the economy for this?\n\nBut the US death toll from coronavirus this year has exceeded 62,000 , surpassing the high-end estimate for flu deaths since October. And coronavirus has killed at a much faster rate than the flu, claimingall those lives in just three months.\n\nHere are several reasons why coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu -- and why extra precautions are needed:\n\nCoronavirus is much more contagious than the flu\n\nAnd this coronavirus is so new, it's not clear whether it would dissipate in summer, or by how much. But the fact that it kept spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests warm weather won't slow its spread.\n\nCoronavirus has killed at a much faster rate\n\nFrom October 2019 to early April 2020, the flu killed an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 people in the US , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those numbers are preliminary, and the CDC said it stopped updating its preliminary estimates for this flu season on April 4.\n\nIf 62,000 people died from the flu between October 1 and April 4, that means the US had an average of about 331 flu deaths a day.\n\nSo from February 6 through April 30, an average of more than 739 people died per day from coronavirus in the US.\n\nCoronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms\n\nWith the flu, the incubation period is relatively short. People typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection, with symptoms often showing up within two days , the CDC says.\n\nThat means people who get sick from the flu will know they're sick fairly soon and will likely stay home, avoiding contact with others.\n\nBut the incubation period with coronavirus is about three to 14 days, and \"symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure,\" according to Harvard Medical School\n\n\"We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms,\" Harvard experts write. \"Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms.\"\n\nIf true, Harvard said, \"this strengthens the case for face masks, physical distancing, and contact tracing , all of which can help reduce the risk that someone who is infected but not yet contagious may unknowingly infect others.\"\n\nIt's easy for asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA's School of Public Health.\n\n\"When you speak, sometimes you'll spit a little bit,\" she said. \"You'll rub your nose. You'll touch your mouth. You'll rub your eyes. And then you'll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.\"\n\nYou can get a flu vaccine but not a coronavirus vaccine",

Walters had to get towed toward the end of his trip by the Coast Guard after fighting against strong winds that were blowing him in the opposite direction of his destination. Having aimed for Antigua's English Harbour, Walters realized he was going to miss the line. \"As I was at such a critical point, I had to face the fact that if I didn't take up their offer then I would miss Antigua,\" he said. \"But I'm delighted to have arrived and it was great to have such a fantastic welcome.\" Having been in open water since January 25, Walters has also missed much of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. When his wife updated him on how badly things had gotten -- with many dying or out of work -- he was shocked. \"Nothing like this has ever happened in our lifetime so it's been hard to imagine what kind of world I would be returning to,\" he said. Walters poses with his boat before setting off to break the record. Now that he's landed in Antigua, he's been wearing and mask, and there are restrictions, he said. \"And of course, no one could give me a hug or a pat on the back when I arrived. But so far, so good. I guess things may be different when I return to the UK,\" he said. Walters has now rowed the Atlantic five times -- three times solo and twice in two-person boats -- and recently rowed from the source of the River Thames to the sea. This was Walters' last crossing before hanging up his oars, having rowed the Atlantic alone to raise funds for UK military veterans charity Help for Heroes Walters, a carpenter by trade, built his boat in his front garden 22 years ago. Called the George Geary, the boat is named after his grandfather, a former Leicestershire and England cricketer who played in several Ashes tests and joined the Air Force during World War I. Walters plans to leave the boat in Antigua and hopes it will find a place in a museum in English Harbour. \"Graham has always been an adventurer, so he's had it in his mind for a while now to do one final journey,\" said Jean Walters, his wife, in a press statement. \"To complete the challenge and take the record will be a massive personal achievement for him.\"", "categories": [{"confident":

Roberts has had to step in as a kind of traffic cop at certain times.\n\nUnder the new system that will be in place for arguments beginning on Monday, a justice will get the chance to exhaust his or her line of questioning before the next justice begins. If there is time, according to a release from Kathy Arberg, the Court's public information officer, any remaining questions can be asked after the first round is over.\n\nArberg said the changes were made in \"keeping with public health guidance in response to COVID-19.\" In all, the court will hear 10 cases over the next two weeks. The most noteworthy cases fall on May 12 concerning President Donald Trump's bid to shield his financial records from release. How the Supreme Court has enabled Trump on immigration The sessions will mark the first time in history that members of the public will be able to listen in to arguments real time. The morning of arguments, all of the lawyers on the case will call into the teleconferencing system at 9:15 a.m. ET, 45 minutes before arguments are set begin at the customary 10 a.m. They will be placed on a conference call with the Clerk of the Court, Scott Harris, to receive any last-minute instructions. Their line will then be muted until 9:50 a.m. and they will be moved to a main conference call line to await the beginning of arguments. At 10:00 the justices -- working remotely -- will join the call. Pamela Talkin, the Marshal of the court, will open the session and Roberts will announce the first case and acknowledge counsel. Following the court's usual practice, the lawyer will get two minutes of uninterrupted time. Roberts will then have the opportunity to ask questions, and when that is complete, the next most senior justice will begin, and on down the line. Justice Clarence Thomas rarely asks questions at oral arguments, so he may choose to pass. After all the lawyers have spoken, the lawyer representing the petitioner in the case will receive three minutes for rebuttal. If there is another case that day, it will begin promptly after the first has competed. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held arguments using a similar protocol this week . There were some technical glitches, and the arguments extended longer than anticipated, but there were few interruptions.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-2", "level": 2, "links":

The Biden campaign said the guest would discuss the impact that coronavirus has had on women.\n\nClinton said in a tweet that she was \"excited\" to join Biden.\n\nHer endorsement was a forgone conclusion -- she had said for months that she would back the eventual nominee -- but it remains a significant boost for Biden because the former secretary of state still enjoys deep support from an array of Democratic voters. She won over 65 million votes four years ago and has proven to be a prolific fundraiser throughout her political career.\n\nBut Clinton's endorsement will also allow Republicans to dredge up every controversy and attack that they used against the 2016 Democratic nominee, something Republicans are eager to do as they look to recreate the strategy that led to President Donald Trump 's victory.\n\n\"There is no greater concentration of Democrat establishment than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton together,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \"President Trump beat her once and now he'll beat her chosen candidate.\"\n\nClinton is the latest top Democrat to back Biden, who after a sluggish start to the primary process saw his fortunes shift by dominating the South Carolina primary and notching a series of key wins on Super Tuesday. Former President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders all endorsed Biden earlier this month.\n\nClinton sat out the primary fight, telling interviewers repeatedly that she was paying attention to the nominating process from afar.\n\n\"I'm just watching and hoping that we nominate whoever is the strongest candidate to take out the current incumbent,\" Clinton said in March, before the field had largely cleared. \"That's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day.\"\n\nBut Clinton stepped up her praise of Biden after Super Tuesday, once the former vice president's only opponent was Bernie Sanders, a politician who Clinton has deep-seated animosity for after the Vermont senator stayed in the 2016 primary for months after his path to winning the nomination then was mostly closed.\n\n\"He has the experience,\" Clinton said of the former vice president. \"He knows what needs to be done, he can repair the damage that he would be inheriting.\"\n\nClinton endorsing Biden is a reversal of what happened to the duo in 2016, when Biden stepped aside and endorsed his former Senate colleague despite wanting to run himself. The decision partially stemmed from former President Barack Obama firmly getting behind Clinton, all but denying his running mate and vice president the chance to run for the job in 2016.\n\nThe decision not to run back then has weighed on Biden, though.\n\n\"I regret it every day, but it was the right decision for my family and for me,\" Biden said in January 2016, noting the fact that his son, Beau, had died the prior year. \"And I plan on staying deeply involved.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 945163, "name": "Devan Cole"}, "body": "\"In the end, my campaign was rewarded for our persistence and patience. But victory is bittersweet. It was unacceptable to hold an election under circumstances in which people were forced to choose between their safety and voting. It disenfranchised countless people and raised serious concerns for the future of our democracy,\" Justice-elect Jill Karofsky wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times.\n\n\"Now, over two weeks later, we have an uptick in Covid-19 cases, especially in dense urban centers like Milwaukee and Waukesha, where few polling places were open and citizens were forced to stand in long lines to cast a ballot,\" wrote Karofsky, who previously served as a county judge.\n\nThere are currently more than 5,900 cases in Wisconsin and more than 100 deaths caused by the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. At the time of the election on April 7, there were more than 2,500 cases and more than 90 deaths in the state, according to the university.\n\nHowever, last week, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk noted that several of those people \"reported other possible exposures as well.\" Democrat wins Wisconsin race that Republicans insisted on holding despite pandemic The election had been a point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans, with the GOP insisting it go on even as public health officials were urging Americans to stay home to avoid contracting the deadly virus. Karofsky's win was an embarrassment for state and national Republicans, who had blocked Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' bid to postpone the election or have it conducted entirely by mail and had fought in court against rules that would have made it easier to cast absentee ballots. Karofsky wrote that the US Supreme Court, which ruled just before the election that ballots must be postmarked by election day on April 7, \"erred\" in its decision, which she said \"they didn't have the time to think through and that caused tremendous confusion in my state.\" \"I find it unconscionable that Wisconsin voters were forced to choose between their safety and having their voices heard in our democracy. The right to vote is fundamental to the American creed,\" she wrote. \"Courts making partisan decisions, sending people out to vote in the middle of a global pandemic, is exactly what's wrong with a judiciary that has become too political, and I think a deliberate attempt to suppress the vote in Wisconsin.\" The newly elected justice also blasted a decision by the state's Supreme Court to halt Evers' order postponing the election until June, saying that both that ruling and the US Supreme Court's ruling \"are seen as being along partisan lines, with allies of Republicans refusing to delay the election.\" Karofsky also noted that \"every member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court had already voted early. They weren't putting themselves at risk.\" Karofsky's victory reduces the conservative majority on Wisconsin's high court to 4-3.

He was like, 'It's OK, I'll see you when this is all over,' and that was the last thing he said.\"While Luis was battling COVID-19, his parents, Josephine and Luis Sr., were already in the hospital. Four days after Luis died, 56-year-old Josephine also died from COVID-19. Family members said she got sick first.Luis was found dead in his home, his brother said.\"I kept calling him and calling him and he did not pick up,\" said his older brother Justin Tapiru.Justin said Luis was told to stay home and self-isolate because both his parents were sick with COVID-19.\"He told me in the morning that he was fine,\" Justin said. \"He said he maybe coughed a little bit.\"\"For the entire household to be affected by it in such a serious way, it really shows how serious it is,\" Pecirno said.Luis Sr. was just taken off a ventilator last week, waking up to find his family did not make it.\"He can barely walk right now,\" Justin said.The family believes COVID-19 started spreading through their apartment on March 31, when Josephine stayed home from work because she wasn't feeling well. Her family believes she got the virus from a local nursing home where she worked.\"One of her coworkers got sick, and then everybody else got sick,\" Justin said.The Filipino family moved to Chicago from Canada. The community remembers them as hardworking and loving. Their neighbors are working to raise money to help them during this difficult time.\"The grieving process is really different because you have to start by making sense of it, and then I think we are seeing how serious this is,\" said Pecirno.This week, Luis Sr. was moved out of the hospital and to a rehab center to help with his ongoing recovery.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1969507, "name": "Paul R. La"}, "body": "New York (CNN Business) Randall Stephenson, the longtime chief executive officer of AT&T, is stepping down. Stephenson will be succeeded by AT&T Chief Operating Officer John Stankey, who will take over the role on July 1.\n\nStephenson has served asCEO for more than 13 years and oversaw the massive acquisitions of CNN parent company Time Warner (now known as WarnerMedia) and satellite TV provider DirecTV.\n\nAT&T said Friday that Stephenson will remain the company's executive chairman until January 2021 \"to ensure a smooth leadership transition.\" Stankey will join the board on June 1 -- but he will not be the company's next chairman. AT&T said that it will name an independent director after Stephenson steps down from that role next year.\n\nStankey, 57, who until earlier this month was also CEO of WarnerMedia, was named president and COO of AT&T last October. At that time, Stankey's promotion was widely believed to be a sign that he was first in line to one day take over for Stephenson.\n\nIn a statement, Stankey said he was \"honored\" to be appointed to the helm of AT&T, which he called \"a company with a rich history and a bright future.\"\n\nStephenson added that Stankey, who has been with AT&T for 35 years in a variety of roles, \"has the right experiences and skills, and the unflinching determination every CEO needs to act on his convictions.\"\n\n\"I look forward to partnering with him as the leadership team moves forward on our strategic initiatives while navigating the difficult economic and health challenges currently facing our country and the world,\" Stephenson added.\n\n\"Leadership succession is one of the Board's most important responsibilities,\" Mooney said. \"After an extensive evaluation, it was clear that John Stankey was the right person to lead AT&T into the future.\"\n\nThe selection of Stankey caps a busy month for the company. Ma Bell announced in early April that Jason Kilar, the former head of streaming media service Hulu, would take over as CEO of WarnerMedia -- the unit that owns HBO, TNT and the Warner Bros. studio as well as CNN.\n\nThe company said growth in its wireless telecom unit helped offset declines at WarnerMedia, which has been hit by a slump in advertising and the shutdown of movie theaters due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAT&T stock has lagged the market and big rivals\n\nStill, AT&T has had a bit of a rocky ride on Wall Street since Stephenson -- who was previously COO of Baby Bell SBC Communications, which bought AT&T and took the Ma Bell name in 2005 -- took over in 2007.\n\nAT&T's stock was down about 1% in midday trading Friday.\n\nAT&T took on a massive amount of debt in order to go on its media shopping spree and that troubled many analysts and investors.\n\nOne activist investment firm, Elliott Management, even acquired a stake in AT&T to put pressure on the company to sell assets.\n\nElliott Management was also critical of WarnerMedia's strategy, which was led by Stankey. The investment firm questioned whether the company's new HBO Max streaming service would be a hit, adding that it felt there was \"a growing sense that AT&T doesn't have a plan\" when it comes to media.\n\n\"Elliott supports John Stankey as AT&T's next CEO,\" said Elliott partner Jessie Cohn in a statement sent to CNN Business, noting that the CEO search process was a \"robust one.\"\n\n\"We look forward to working with John as he begins his term as CEO,\" Cohn added.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3-11", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

A police statement at the time said that the theft took place at around 3:15 a.m. local time, and that intruders entered the premises by breaking through a glass door.\n\n\"I am shocked and unbelievably pissed off,\" museum director Jan Rudolph de Lorm said during a press conference on March 30. \"It is very bad for the Groninger Museum. It's also very bad for Singer.\"\n\n\"But above all it is horrible for all of us, because art is there to be seen and shared by all of us, for society as a whole, to bring enjoyment, to bring inspiration, and also to bring comfort. Especially in this difficult time,\" he added.\n\nThe painting was created in the town of Nuenen, where Van Gogh stayed with his parents between 1883 and 1885. It depicts the garden of the parsonage they lived in and where his father served as pastor. It also shows the ruins of an old church that featured in a number of other Van Gogh works from the period.\n\nPolice said that painting has now been added to Interpol's stolen art database.\n\nThe Singer Laren museum announced its temporary closure on March 13, shortly after the country's government announced a ban on large gatherings and shuttered the Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB1-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB1-3", "parent":

Andrew Cuomo said, \"about April 20 we think we're going to have results.\"\n\nWhen results were not announced on Monday, CNN asked why not.\n\nCuomo answered that the hospitals \"are to send their results\" to the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC has not received results from the New York hospitals, according to agency spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund.\n\nCNN did not receive an immediate answer from a spokesman for the FDA.\n\nThe New York Department of Health did not respond to CNN's inquiries about when it plans to release the study results.\n\nTuesday, after Cuomo met with Trump at the White House, a reporter asked Cuomo if he had \"any indication of what the state results have been.\" Cuomo answered that he did not know.\n\nHoltgrave, dean of the University at Albany School of Public Health, said he plans to finish his study analysis by the middle of next week, and publicly release it within a few days.\n\n\"We're continuing our work every day on this study and anticipate having our final analysis in place by the end of April,\" he said, adding that \"it's very important get final results study out quickly as possible\" so that doctors and patients can make decisions about whether to use hydroxychloroquine.\n\nFor more than a month, the President has been a cheerleader for the drug, even though doctors have questioned whether it's safe or effective for coronavirus patients.\n\n\"I think it's going to be great,\" Trump said on March 19.\n\n\"It will be wonderful. It will be so beautiful. It will be a gift from heaven if it works,\" he added two weeks later.\n\nIn the University at Albany study, the researchers plan to analyze 1,600 Covid-19 patients divided equally into four groups: those taking hydroxychloroquine; those taking chloroquine, a similar drug; those taking hydroxychloroquine along with the antibiotic azithromycin; and those taking none of the drugs, as a comparison group.\n\nIt is an observational study looking back at patients' hospitalizations, not a randomized clinical trial.\n\nThe panel said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against using hydroxychloroquine on its own.\n\nBecause of similar experiences, doctors in Brazil and Sweden have warned about Covid-19 patients taking the drug.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7",

Another person familiar with the call said it went well.\n\nBut the President said during Wednesday's news conference that he told Kemp he disagreed \"strongly\" with the governor's decision to reopen some businesses in his state.\n\n\"I told the governor of Georgia Brian Kemp that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia,\" Trump said.\n\nHe suggested he would intervene if he saw \"something totally egregious.\" \"I love those people. They're great. They've been strong, resolute, but at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right. I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he's doing but I want to let the governors do (what they want),\" the President said. \"Now, if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I'll do (something),\" Trump said, but did not provide specifics on what he would do. Kemp, a staunch ally of Trump, on Monday announced Georgia would allow nail salons, massage therapists, bowling alleys and gyms to open Friday. In-person church services can resume. And restaurants and movie theaters can open Monday. His order also bars cities from imposing their own restrictions on businesses. It's the most aggressive move yet to reopen a state's economy as Trump optimistically pushes for a May 1 end to some statewide lockdowns. It also came as a surprise to mayors and some members of Kemp's own coronavirus task force. Kemp made the decision to reopen the state's businesses at least a day before announcing it but did not inform the White House beforehand, a source familiar with the matter said. shows that as of Wednesday, Georgia had seen 20,166 confirmed cases of coronavirus and had recorded 818 deaths resulting from the virus. shows that as of Wednesday, Georgia had seen 20,166 confirmed cases of coronavirus and had recorded 818 deaths resulting from the virus. Data collected by Johns Hopkins University shows that as of Wednesday, Georgia had seen 20,166 confirmed cases of coronavirus and had recorded 818 deaths resulting from the virus. \"In the same way that we carefully closed businesses and urged operations to end to mitigate the virus' spread, today we're announcing plans to incrementally and safely reopen sectors of our economy,\" Kemp told reporters Monday. Kemp's decision has drawn criticism from public health experts who have repeatedly stressed the dangers of relaxing social distancing measures too early. Georgia hit its projected peak for daily deaths on April 7, according to an influential model often cited by the White House. But that same model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, says that Georgia shouldn't start relaxing social distancing until after June 15 -- when the state can begin considering other measures to contain the virus, such as contact tracing and isolation. Mayors in Georgia are pushing back against Kemp's decision. \"I have searched my head and my heart on this and I am at a loss as to what the governor is basing this decision on,\" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, told CNN. She said she is considering legal options for a city that she said is \"not out of the woods yet.\" \"You have to live to fight another day. And you have to be able to be amongst the living to be able to recover,\" she said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Bright's statement.\n\nBright said he \"limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Bright's move in a statement to CNN Tuesday and said he will now lead a new government project: a public-private partnership on vaccine development and treatment.\n\n\"On April 17, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new public-private partnership -- the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership -- to accelerate the development of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment options. At the same time, given the simultaneous importance of accelerating the development of diagnostic tests for COVID-19, Dr. Rick Bright will transfer the skills he has applied as Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to the National Institutes of Health, as part of a bold plan to accelerate the development and deployment of novel point-of-care testing platforms,\" the HHS statement said.\n\nBright had been with the agency as its influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division director since 2010 before he was tapped to lead it in late 2016.\n\nBARDA is a small, but powerful agency with remarkable purchasing power. Though little-known, it is especially critical during a pandemic, which is why Bright's abrupt departure surprised his colleagues.\n\nBright was removed from his position but is not resigning, the source familiar said. He said Wednesday he will request that the HHS inspector general \"investigate the manner in which this administration has politicized the work of BARDA and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections as well as efforts that lack scientific merit.\"\n\nHe has not yet filed the request, according to the source, but intends to do so in the next day or so.\n\nHis lawyers said in the statement that that they will request a stay of the termination and that Bright \"be permitted to remain in his position\" pending the investigation's findings.",

The increase is a stark illustration of the devastating toll the pandemic is having on Massachusetts and New England.\n\nAnd while Reiss noted there was no immediate way to determine how many of the death notices that filled pages A-13 to A-28 came from coronavirus victims -- death notices don't always say how the person died -- several of them mentioned a battle with the virus.\n\nThe section has \"been growing every Sunday since the coronavirus pandemic has been surging here in Massachusetts,\" Reiss said, adding that the previous Sunday, the paper ran 11 pages of death notices.\n\nReiss explained that besides to the increased death toll -- 1,706 people have died as of Monday afternoon -- the uptick in death notices could be because families aren't able to hold wakes and funerals now. With no time constraint to publish a death notice before a scheduled memorial service, families could be submitting their death notices to be published on Sunday when the paper gets higher readership. The Globe, of course, isn't the only paper to mark an increase. Newspapers in other hot spots around the country are seeing a drastic rise in the number of obituaries and death notices they are publishing. In Louisiana, The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate published more than eight pages of death notices on Sunday. \"On the same weekend last year, there were about four pages devoted to obituaries,\" according to an article in the Advocate. There were approximately 25,000 cases and 1,328 deaths in the state as of Monday afternoon. In today's @NOLAnews, we had just over 8 pages of death notices. It's been like this the last few Sundays, which is the biggest day of readership. We used to consider 4 pages a lot. All of these beloved family members and friends for so many. And no funerals. pic.twitter.com/xtMypiaNb4 — Jennifer Brown (@brownjen) April 19, 2020 The Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey, published 109 obituaries across nine page of its April 12 edition, A year earlier, there were 17 obituaries on one and a half pages, according to nj.com. New Jersey has reported more than 85,000 cases and 4,362 deaths, second only to New York. Connecticut's Hartford Courant published 12 pages of obituaries on Sunday. The state has about 18,000 cases and 1,127 deaths. \"It's more than I've ever seen. On a Sunday, you'd see at the most three, maybe four pages, so it was about triple what we normally do,\" said Rick Green, the Courant's assistant managing editor. The Hartford Courant has 12 pages of obituaries today. \n\n\n\nThe index on the left usually runs 1/4 or 1/2 way down the page. pic.twitter.com/g4sEJ6ZQKT — Arielle Levin Becker (@ariellelb) April 19, 2020 America's new reality echoes what Italy went through in March. The Eco di Bergamo, a newspaper in the hard-hit region of Lombardy, normally publishes one page of obituaries. On March 14, 10 pages of obituaries filled the newspaper. Do look at this if you have any doubts about how deadly coronavirus is. The video shows a man showing the death notices in a Bergamo newspaper on Feb 9 and the death notices today.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1065279, "name": "Jill Martin"}, "body": "While it remains uncertain when the WNBA season will begin and what that might look like because of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was no doubt who the top pick in the 2020 draft would be.\n\nThat honor went to Sabrina Ionescu, with the New York Liberty selecting the Oregon Ducks guard at No. 1 overall.\n\nAdditionally, the WNBA honored Alyssa Altobelli, Gianna Bryant and Payton Chester -- who passed away in a helicopter accident with Kobe Bryant on January 26.\n\nAll three were named as honorary draft picks on Friday. The WNBA plans to honor Kobe Bryant, a passionate advocate of the league, during the upcoming season.\n\nTypically, the WNBA draft is held in New York City. However, with the Covid-19 pandemic, Friday's draft is virtual, with league commissioner Cathy Engelbert announcing the selections and top prospects taking part remotely.\n\nIn advance, the WNBA sent players caps for every team in the league, so they could wear the one from the team that drafts them. The WNBA season was scheduled to begin May 15, but that has been postponed because of the pandemic. Ionescu, a 22-year-old guard, is the NCAA's all-time leader -- for women and men -- in triple doubles, with 26. She's also the only college basketball player, male or female, to have 2,000 points, 1,000 assists and 1,000 rebounds in her career Ionescu set that latter mark back in February, just hours after she spoke at Kobe and Gianna Bryant's memorial in Los Angeles. Following the ceremony, Ionescu was back on the basketball court, having taken a charter flight to the Bay Area to take on then-No. 4 Stanford. Not only did she help Oregon, ranked No. 3 at the time, to a 74-66 win, but Ionescu made NCAA history that came on a date, 2/24/20, that has special significance to her. Those are the jersey numbers of Gianna, Kobe and herself. Ionescu had developed a friendship with Kobe and Gianna, working out with Gianna in the summer while helping Kobe coach games. \"That one was for (Kobe),\" Ionescu said after that game. \"To do it on 2/24/20 is huge. We talked about that in the preseason; I can't really put that into words. He's looking down and really proud of me.\" Ionescu, who in 2019 led the Ducks to the Final Four and was considered the top prospect for the WNBA even then, opted to return to Oregon for her senior season to try to end her college career with a national championship. Instead, her final game in a Ducks uniform came on March 8, when Oregon defeated Stanford in the Pac-12 championship game 89-56. Ionescu finished the game with 20 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds, and she was named the tournament's most outstanding player. It was Oregon's second Pac-12 title in three years. Oregon finished the season ranked second in the Associated Press poll. Ionescu's parents moved from Romania to northern California in 1990 after the Romanian Revolution. Seven years later, Ionescu and her twin brother, Eddy, were born. Her first language was Romanian, which she used when playing with her brother in basketball games.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1230969, "name": "Maeve Reston"}, "body": "(CNN) Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday announced a statewide task force of medical and economic experts to reopen the state, with early May as a target date, issuing an executive order outlining the standards that will be used to guide the reopening of private businesses.\n\nPlans for opening businesses will be announced on April 27, depending on whether the state has been able to contain the coronavirus , but schools will be closed for the remainder of the school year. Abbott, a Republican, stressed that the framework would be determined by \"data and by doctors\" and continued adherence to social distancing guidelines.\n\n\"Because of the efforts by everyone to slow the spread, we're now beginning to see glimmers that the worst of Covid-19 may soon be behind us,\" Abbott said at a news conference.\n\nThe statewide task force will include Lieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick, who stirred controversy across the nation in late March by arguing that Americans should be allowed to go back to work, Dr. Mark McClellan, the former federal administrator of Medicaid and Medicare, and several doctors from Texas universities.\n\n\"We have demonstrated that we can corral the coronavirus,\" Abbott said, pointing to a statistic that Texas has the \"second-most recoveries from Covid-19 of all states in America.\"\n\n\"Understand this: opening in Texas must occur in stages. Obviously, not all businesses can open all at once on May the first. Some businesses, if fully open, without better distancing standards, would be more likely to set us back, rather than to propel us forward. A more strategic approach is required to ensure that we don't reopen only to have to shut down once again.\"\n\nIn contrast, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has said his state of 20 million people has tested more than 500,000 people for coronavirus over the past month. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has set a goal of conducting 25,000 tests a day by the end of this month within the state's population of 40 million people.\n\nAbbott has said the state is trying to ramp up testing in partnership with private industry and has said he sees \"glimmers of hope\" in testing data so far \"with a bunch of red flags attached.\"\n\nThe Republican governor has spoken frequently with Vice President Mike Pence as the Trump administration tries to help bolster the struggling energy sector, and Abbott said he also conferred with President Donald Trump about his reopening plans over the weekend.\n\nUnemployment claims in Texas rose above one million over the past month, representing about 7.2% of the state's total labor force, leading some business leaders to nudge Abbott toward reopening. The state's economy is reeling not only from coronavirus closures but also the plunge in oil prices, which have fallen from about $60 a barrel down below $20 since January.\n\nThe need for coronavirus resources in Texas will not peak until April 29, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and local officials have cited ongoing concerns about the inadequate level of testing.\n\nAbbott issued his stay-at-home order on April 2. Since then, he has said he is working on plans to reopen private businesses \"slowly, strategically, smartly and safely.\"\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "categories": [{"confident":

Asked why he believed his fundraiser had struck a chord with so many people, he said: \"I think because our National Health Service is good -- they do so good for me -- I had a broken hip and I had cancer and they treated me magnificently. \"I think people realize that...everyone, wherever they are, gets equally treated, just as well, with the same efficiency and kindness that we get from our nurses and doctors -- who, after all, at the moment are on the firing line (of the coronavirus crisis).\" There are growing calls for Moore to be honored for his service to the UK.

A spokeswoman for Number 10 Downing Street said in a statement that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will look at ways to recognize Moore's efforts. \"Tom has captured the heart of the nation with his heroic efforts and raised an incredible amount of money for hard working NHS staff,\" the spokeswoman said in the statement. \"He has embodied the spirit of the whole country in doing their bit for the battle against coronavirus to support the NHS and save lives. From his military contributions to his support for NHS staff, Tom has demonstrated a lifetime of bravery and compassion. \"The PM will certainly be looking at ways to recognize Tom for his heroic efforts.\" Moore completed his 100-length challenge at his home on Thursday. Tributes and thanks, meanwhile, have poured in from around the world for his fundraising efforts. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Thursday he was \"inspired\" by Moore's efforts. On Friday, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, said in an interview with BBC Breakfast that Moore was a \"fundraising machine.\" \"It's wonderful that everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination,\" he said. \"I think he's a one-man fundraising machine and god knows what the final total will be but good on him, I hope he keeps going.\" Asked what he made of being called a hero, Moore thanked people for \"their kind remarks\" and said: \"Let me assure you -- eventually, we shall all get through it, and all will be well in the end.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 951245, "name": "Jackie Wattles"}, "body": "NASA announced Friday that SpaceX will launch astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a mission to the International Space Station on Wednesday, May 27 at 4:32 p.m. ET. Liftoff will be from Florida's Kennedy Space Center — marking the first time a rocket will carry astronauts into orbit from the United States since NASA's Space Shuttle program retired in 2011.\n\nIt will also be the first crewed mission for SpaceX since its founding 18 years ago.\n\nBecause of Covid-19, however, there will be no crowds of spectators lining the beaches and viewing sites along Florida's Space Coast to watch the craft hurtle toward the ISS, as they have for the launch of nearly every crewed US mission since Alan Shepard became the first American to reach orbit in 1961.\n\nOnly a limited number of reporters will be allowed on site, and NASA said it will not host any members of the public.\n\n\"This has become yet another footnote in the story of coronavirus and its impact on America,\" said Dale Ketcham, a vice president at Space Florida, a local industry group. \"But NASA is continuing to press ahead with Commercial Crew because there is a profound obligation to keep space station operational.\" NASA and SpaceX prepare to launch astronauts from the US again NASA has shut down many of its activities in response to coronavirus, but it has maintained all ISS-related activity. NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan returned from their stay on the space station aboard a Russian spacecraft on Friday. The ISS has continually hosted a rotating crew of astronauts from all over the world since 2000. The United States and Russia are the space station's primary operators, but since 2011, Russia has been the only country capable of transporting astronauts to and from the ISS. NASA has paid up to $86 million per seat and about $55.4 million on average to fly US astronauts aboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft, according to the space agency's inspector general. Years ago, NASA asked the private sector to develop a new generation of crew-worthy spacecraft. SpaceX was allotted $2.6 billion and Boeing was awarded $4.2 billion in 2014, and the space agency initially predicted their vehicles would be ready to fly astronauts by 2017. But development of both spacecraft took years longer than expected. Here's how NASA protects astronauts and the International Space Station from coronavirus The companies were neck-in-neck, but SpaceX emerged as the clear leader after completing a successful test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft's emergency abort system in January. Less than a month earlier, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft suffered major setbacks during an uncrewed orbital flight test. The company has since said it will repeat that test mission in the fall. The Crew Dragon mission in May, dubbed Demo-2, will be the final test for Crew Dragon before NASA transitions to operational crewed flights to the space station using the spacecraft. Hurley and Behnken are both former military test pilots and veteran astronauts who previously flew on space shuttle missions. After launching on May 27, they will spend about 110 days in space. They'll return on the Crew Dragon capsule, which will navigate back through Earth's atmosphere and splash down just off Florida's Atlantic Coast. Though the US space agency paid the companies to develop their vehicles, Starliner and Crew Dragon are privately owned and operated. Unlike previous human spaceflight programs, NASA is essentially a customer of the companies. SpaceX and Boeing have both announced plans to fly tourists aboard the spacecraft alongside NASA astronauts.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB15-7", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1339278, "name": "Kara Scannell"}, "body": "The federal Bureau of Prisons has notified Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, that he will be released early from prison due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to people familiar with the matter and his lawyer.\n\nCohen was scheduled for release in November 2021, but he will be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence from home confinement, the people said. He will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine at the prison camp before he is released.\n\nCohen was notified on Thursday of his pending release, and his lawyer, Roger Adler, confirmed it to CNN.\n\nHis pending release comes as the Bureau of Prisons, which has been under pressure for its early handling of the virus at its facilities, has been thinning out its prison populations by releasing some nonviolent and medically vulnerable inmates to home confinement or furloughing their sentences in response to the pandemic.\n\nSpokespersons for the bureau and the US attorney's office in Manhattan, which prosecuted Cohen, declined to comment. Cohen's pending release comes after a federal judge rejected his request last month. At the time Cohen accused the Justice Department of not treating him fairly and later added his concerns about the virus. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to tax fraud, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. He admitted to helping facilitate hush money payments to two women who alleged past affairs with Trump. Trump has denied having affairs with the women. When pleading guilty, Cohen implicated Trump , telling a federal judge that he had made the payments \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump, who prosecutors identified in court filings as \"Individual 1.\" Cohen had been a vocal surrogate for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, often sparring with reporters and appearing on television to support his longtime client. His pending early release comes in the middle of Trump's reelection campaign and as the President is facing his greatest test: handling the pandemic. According to the Bureau of Prisons online tracking system , there are 473 inmates and 279 staff members who have tested positive for the virus and 18 inmates have died. To date, the system reports 1,198 inmates have been placed on home confinement. There are more than 143,000 prisoners at federal facilities across the country. Cohen isn't the only well-known inmate who is getting out from behind bars amid the pandemic. Michael Avenatti, the attorney who represented Stormy Daniels, one of the woman who Cohen helped pay to squash her allegation of an affair with Trump, has been granted a temporary 90-day release from a federal jail in New York after a period of quarantine. Avenatti has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan since a judge revoked his bail earlier this year. He is awaiting sentencing after he was convicted of attempting to extort more than $20 million from Nike. He is also facing two other criminal trials, including one where he is charged with stealing more than $300,000 from Daniels. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Avenatti will be confined to a friend's home in California, where he will not be allowed to use the internet. He will have to turn himself back in to authorities at the end of the 90-day period. This story has been updated with further details and background.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1356767, "name": "Anna Bahney"}, "body": "Millions of people are enduring financial hardship after a job loss or drop in income because of the coronavirus outbreak .\n\nMore than half of the jobs in the US economy are at risk, according to Moody's Analytics. Over the past four weeks 22 million people have filed for unemployment insurance\n\nIf you are struggling, there is help. But in most cases you need to know who to reach out to and what to ask for.\n\nThe federal government passed a $2 trillion stimulus bill and regulators are pressuring companies to work with consumers.\n\nIn addition to sending out direct payments (more on when you'll get a payment here ) and expanding unemployment insurance , federal relief for many recurring expenses is available. If you lost health insurance because of a job loss, this is how to get coverage . Be sure to explore state, county and city programs, as well as relief aid available locally.\n\nHere's where and how to access help in your financial life.\n\nIf your loan is not federally backed, you may be able to receive similar relief options from your loan servicer or your state.\n\nBut those measures only account for about half of the 44 million rental households in the country. The rest will need to rely on a patchwork of state, county and city assistance. At least half of states have temporary eviction moratoriums in place, including New York and California , and dozens of municipalities have adopted measures as well. Some states are offering rent assistance, like Delaware , which offers up to $1,500 to residents struggling to pay rent or electric bills because of coronavirus.\n\nThe six-month suspension and interest waiver applies only to federally held loans, roughly 85% of federal student loans. That includes Direct federal loans, as well as PLUS loans that parents may have taken out on behalf of their children.\n\nAlso, the legislation halts collections on federally owned loans that are in default, including wage and tax refund garnishment. Defaulted loans will also not accrue interest through September.\n\nPrivate student loans are not included, but borrowers facing hardship should contact their lender. Some are offering debt relief programs to borrowers during the pandemic.\n\nIf you are unable to pay your monthly bill, reach out to the credit card company and ask what they can offer. A best case scenario would be deferring payment without accruing interest and no late fees.\n\nIf they don't agree to that, ask if they will reduce your minimum payment, increase your credit limit or lower an interest rate in the short term.\n\nIf you make an agreement with your creditor -- for partial payment or a skipped payment, for example -- and are current on your account, you will be reported as current even if you are not paying in full, so long as you adhere to your agreement.\n\nThose already delinquent when entering into an agreement will remain so during the specified time, until the account is current. When your delinquent account becomes current, it will be reported as being in good standing.\n\nThis applies to agreements established between January 31 and will last until either 120 days after the March 27th enactment of the CARES Act (June 25) or 120 days following the end of the national emergency, whichever is later.\n\nYour car insurance company can provide details on what they are offering specifically.\n\nCompanies that signed the pledge agree \"not to terminate service to any residential or small business customer because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused

Politico first reported the news of Caputo's hire.\n\nCaputo's hire ensures a firm ally to the President is in charge of messaging for a department playing a critical role in the response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Trump has come under fire for his administration's delayed response to the pandemic and the lack of widely available testing.\n\nTrump and Caputo have been acquaintances since before the President entered politics.\n\nCaputo first met Trump in 2013 while Trump was considering running for governor of New York. Caputo later joined Trump's presidential campaign in 2015 as a communications staffer, but resigned in June 2016 after publicly mocking former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after Lewandowski's tumultuous exit.\n\nAfter Trump became president, Caputo's past business ties to Russia quickly thrust him into the spotlight of the special counsel investigation. He testified before Congress and gave an interview to special counsel Robert Mueller's team.\n\nHe adamantly denied that there was ever collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin and became an aggressive anti-Mueller personality on Twitter, sometimes spreading false conspiracy theories and debunked claims about the probe.\n\nCaputo appears to have cleansed his Twitter account with the new HHS job. His old tweets are gone, and he changed his profile pictures -- which now features a professional headshot instead of the cover of his recent book, \"The Ukraine Hoax,\" which prompted debunked conspiracies about Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe Mueller report noted that investigators received conflicting information about a May 2016 meeting that Caputo helped arrange between longtime Trump ally Roger Stone and a Florida-based Russian named Henry Greenberg, who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton. Mueller's team spoke to Caputo and Greenberg about the incident, but Mueller's final report did not indicate who was telling the truth. Neither of them was charged with lying to the FBI or any other crimes.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

The research shows the benefits of conducting a universal test on patients, the authors argued in the letter published Monday. Knowing if someone is infectious would help hospitals determine where to place the patients so they won't get other people sick and would help guide decisions on what personal protective equipment the staff may need amid a strain on supplies.\n\nColumbia University Irving Medical Center put a universal testing policy in place for all women admitted for delivery after the medical centers had two coronavirus cases confirmed among their patient population.\n\nOf the 215 pregnant women who delivered at these hospitals between March 22 and April 4, four who tested positive for coronavirus when admitted for delivery had a fever or some other symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nThere were 29 others who tested positive for coronavirus but did not have fever or any other symptoms of the disease. Of those 29, three developed a fever before they were discharged after two days at the hospital. Two of those patients were given antibiotics for what the doctors thought may have been a fever related to endomyometritis, a complication in pregnancy.

An additional patient who tested negative when she was originally admitted showed symptoms three days after the initial test. She tested positive in this second test for the infection. The researchers said that the true prevalence of infection may actually be underreported because of the false negatives that have been associated with some of the tests used to detect the novel coronavirus. It's unclear from this letter if there was later follow up to determine if any of the women who tested positive later developed symptoms of the disease. that ran in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology last week found that of the 43 pregnant women it studied at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, 80% who had tested positive for the coronavirus had a mild form of the disease.

They met as teenagers on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn and were together ever since.\n\nThey moved to Staten Island and had a beautiful daughter, Lauren, who says since her mom was a little kid she loved to dance – especially disco.\n\nWhen Sharon heard the beat, “she would shake it.”\n\nSharon got sick and was hospitalized on March 15. A few days later she was diagnosed with coronavirus, and she died on April 6.\n\nDavid Behrhom\n\nA guy with the big smile, 47-year -old David Behrbom was optimistic, generous and loyal.\n\n“Mr. B,” as he was known, was one of the coolest teachers at PS 55 in the Bronx where he taught physical education. \n\nThe joy of his life was his family, wife Elizabeth and his kids Alex and Eliana.\n\nHe was a life-long Yankees fan who worshiped Reggie Jackson and a huge lover of old-school hip hop, especially Run DMC and Public Enemy.\n\nIn mid-March, Berhbom was diagnosed with a treatable form of leukemia and started chemotherapy.\n\nThen came coronavirus. He was hospitalized in late-March. \n\nHis family says he was awaiting a chance to undergo convalescent plasma therapy to replenish his immune system.\n\nHe died on April 5.\n\nMore Remembrances\n\nAnyone who knows of a teacher, aide or other educators who should be included on the UFT Honors website can email cmetz@uft.org and send photos of remembered members to uftphotos@gmail.com.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6-6", "parent":

When she woke up, her belly was flat and her baby was 5 days old.\n\n\"That was emotionally unbelievable,\" she told CNN. \"It was just crazy to have to try to understand what happened the last 10 days, having to puzzle back together your life.\"\n\nPrimachenko lives in Washington, a state that has gotten a lot of attention as the Covid-19 outbreak has grown in the US. It's where the country's first coronavirus case was announced on January 21, where the first coronavirus-related death in the US occurred, and where a nursing home saw dozens of deaths early on in the pandemic.\n\nPrimachenko lives far south of where those cases developed, along the state's southern border in Vancouver, a suburb of Portland, Oregon.\n\nLike many who have caught the coronavirus, her symptoms began with a cough that escalated to a fever that wasn't going away, she recalled.\n\nPrimachenko, a respiratory therapist at Legacy Salmon Creek Medical Center, hadn't been going to work and doesn't know how she would've caught the coronavirus.\n\n\"She knew the risk,\" said Oksana Luiten, her twin sister. \"She took every precaution.\"\n\nPrimachenko's family encouraged her to get tested, and in the two days she waited for the result, she progressively got worse.\n\n\"Being a respiratory therapist -- just being a human, I guess -- I knew I couldn't keep breathing the way I was and survive,\" she said.\n\nOn March 26, Primachenko went into the ICU of the hospital that employs her, her sister said. Three days later, she was put on a ventilator, the same machine she assists doctors with at work.\n\n\"When you're that sick, you're just fighting for your life,\" Primachenko said. \"My focus wasn't on fear; it was just on getting through it.\"\n\nAs Primachenko lay comatose in her hospital room, her medical team had an hourslong meeting to decide how to handle her care -- and her pregnancy. Her doctors suggested they induce labor to give her lungs more space and her body more nutrients, according to her sister.\n\nPrimachenko's husband, David, gave the doctors permission, and a healthy girl was delivered vaginally on April 1, Primachenko said. David called her Ava, a name he knew his wife loved and a name they later learned, on the internet, means \"breath of life.\"\n\nDays later, the coronavirus still gripped Angela Primachenko, and she was waning physically on April 5.\n\n\"We were actually scared we were going to lose our sister that day,\" Luiten said. The twins are two of 10 siblings.\n\nBut the next day, Primachenko turned a corner, was extubated, and left the ICU. As her bed wheeled down the hall, medical staff clapped and cheered, a video she posted on social media shows. Behind a white face mask, she smiled.\n\nUntil then, the mother is relying on her family's faith, as well as the prayers she received from people she knows -- and many she doesn't -- to get her through this season of life.\n\n\"I believe because of the community and the people and everyone that believed in me,\" she said, \"God just did a miracle to have me and my baby be healthy through this.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB6-7", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6-7", "parent":

But by mid-March, the I Know Science Toy Store & Sci-Lab locations had to shut down. \"We are trying to reinvent how we offer our services,\" Brown said. The classes moved from the back of the toy store to the web. However, the money that comes in online doesn't compare to what the company was making before. \"We're going to be OK for a few months,\" Brown said. \"After that, it's going to get a little bit hairy.\" On March 12, Kate Vlachos arrived in Columbus, Ohio, by way of northeast Pennsylvania in hopes of growing her newly founded business. In 2019 she started Scratch Kitchen, which makes cheesecakes and birthday cakes for dogs. Knowing it might take some time to get the operation up and running in full, she lined up a side job at a local bar to help pay the bills. On March 15, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered that the state's bars and restaurants would have to close. \"I've probably applied for more than two dozen jobs -- grocery stores, the post office,\" Vlachos said. \"I'm also just competing with a million people right now.\" \"It's embarrassing. I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels like a failure; but at the same time, it's through no fault of our own,\" she said. How Covid-19 could redefine labor in America Vlachos, who served as a social worker prior to founding Scratch Kitchen, is trying to get that license transferred from Pennsylvania to Ohio. The process can take months and cost hundreds of dollars, she said. It's the best bet at getting a job that will pay enough, she said, though she recognizes it's also quite risky. \"But I don't have another choice,\" she said. She doesn't have more than a month's worth of funds to pay her bills. \"[Even if] you don't have a family member who's sick or you don't have a loved one that lost their job, there are millions of people right now who are struggling,\" she said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB22-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Those include water, electricity, health services, fire services, grocery stores and municipal services.\n\nAll regular shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, markets and places of worship have been closed and interstate buses and metros have been suspended. Construction activity was also halted during this period. \"Until May 3, all of us will have to remain in lockdown. During this time, we have to follow the same discipline as we have been doing,\" Modi said. Prior to Modi's address, several Indian states had ordered extended lockdowns until April 30, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. Those included Maharashtra, the center of the worst outbreak in the country. While the lockdown measures will continue, Modi said that some states and districts that have shown to have avoided an outbreak \"could be allowed to resume important activities but with conditions.\" \"Until April 20, all districts, neighborhoods and states will be closely monitored to see how strictly they are implementing the rules.\" Modi said. The Prime Minister did not offer any specifics but said \"detailed guidelines\" will be issued by the government on Wednesday. Social distancing is a privilege of the middle class. For India's slum dwellers, it will be impossible India is the world's second most populous country and the fifth biggest economy, but there are fears that the country's health systems would not be able to cope with a major outbreak . The country has reported 10,363 coronavirus cases, including at least 339 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health on Tuesday. In his speech, Modi thanked citizens for adhering to the lockdown restrictions over the past three weeks. \"You have faced difficulties to save yourself and the nation,\" Modi said. \"I understand the great difficulties you are facing regarding food, the lack of movement. Some had to stay away from their families. You are fulfilling duties as disciplined soldiers for the sake of the nation.\" He said that India had made efforts to ensure major outbreaks -- such as those seen in Europe or the United States -- did not spread in the country. \"Today, the pandemic is global. Compared to other countries, India has made efforts to prevent infection here,\" Modi said. \"India didn't wait for the problem to escalate. Instead, as soon as the problem appeared, we tried to stop it by making swift decisions. I can't imagine what the situation would have been had such quick decisions not been taken.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB23-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

This is a person that I knew well by then. The person I know the most in the world. He's extraordinary, he's generous, and he's very tender and loving.\"\n\nShe said they now have two sons -- Max and Gabriel. Moris is part of the international legal team working for Assange, she is not involved in the current extradition case.\n\n\"Forming a family was a deliberate decision to break down those walls around him... and imagine a life beyond that prison,\" she said.\n\n\"While for many people it would seem insane to start a family in that context, for us it was the sane thing to do. It was what keeps things real. And it does. It grounds me and when Julian sees the children, it gives him a lot of peace.\" She said falling in love had been \"an act of rebellion\" and she didn't think people understood \"the extreme situation and pressure\" the couple had faced. Assange, 48, has been held in the high-security Belmarsh prison in London for the past year, after he was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy. He had been holed up at the embassy, yards from the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, since 2012, when he was granted asylum as part of a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing allegations of sexual assault. The Swedish case has since been dropped, but Assange feared US extradition due to his work with WikiLeaks and remained in the embassy. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In a screengrab from a video posted to WikiLeaks' social media, Assange's partner Stella Moris speaks on camera along with the couple's two sons. Moris said she is struggling to think of how to explain to the children why Assange is in prison and became emotional when describing why she had decided to go public with her identity. \"I have taken so many steps for so many years and I feel like Julian's life might be coming to an end,\" she said. \"It's been 10 years of breaking someone down -- trying to destroy his life. It's a well-known pattern for whistleblowers -- people who expose the powerful.\" \"Somehow everyone has failed Julian. We have all failed Julian.\" Assange's legal team had made an application for bail, arguing that the coronavirus epidemic made it unsafe for him to remain in prison. It was rejected. According to Britain's PA Media, Moris spoke in support of the bail application. Lawyer for WikiLeaks' Assange says he was offered a US pardon for denying Russian hacking PA reports that the court declined her request for anonymity. However, the judge delayed making the woman's identity public until 4 p.m. on April 14, pending a possible judicial review at the High Court. WikiLeaks spokesman Joseph Farrell told CNN on Monday: \"Ms. Moris did not take this decision lightly. She has protected her family's privacy fiercely for many years. She wanted to speak in support of Julian's bail application given the grave risk to his health amidst the Covid-19 pandemic and the judge refused her anonymity, forcing her to go public. She is a serious, intelligent and principled person -- and a brilliant legal analyst.\" Lawyer Aitor Martínez, a member of Assange's legal team, told CNN that Moris has worked with their team since the beginning. \"She has always been very protective of her privacy, and this is why she is not used to interacting with the press and has not been exposed to it before,\" Martínez said. Assange's extradition hearing in London is due to continue on May 18.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2053524, "name": "Clare Duffy"}, "body": "New York/Hong Kong (CNN Business) Russia and Saudi Arabia have struck a deal with other major crude producers to slash oil production in a bid to steady a market that has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMembers of OPEC and their allies, including Russia and Mexico, announced Sunday that they have agreed to cut production by 9.7 million barrels a day in May and June — among the deepest cuts ever agreed to by the world's oil producers. After that, the group will steadily ramp up production until the cuts end in April 2022.\n\nThe group, which together is known as OPEC+, had been seeking to cut production in order to buoy oil prices, which fell to 18-year lows in recent weeks . The drop came after Saudi Arabia and Russia abandoned years of production cuts in early March, launching a price war by flooding the market with crude. The coronavirus, meanwhile, dealt a devastating blow to energy demand, pushing prices even lower.\n\nSunday's announcement comes after OPEC+ tried to reach an agreement Thursday to cut 10 million barrels a day, but Mexico would not sign onto that deal.\n\nOn Friday, though, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said his country would cut its output by 100,000 barrels per day. While that amount was far less than what was proposed at Thursday's meeting, López Obrador added that US President Donald Trump offered to cut US production by 250,000 barrels per day to compensate for Mexico. The United States is not an OPEC+ member.\n\nAt a news conference Friday, Trump confirmed he spoke to the Mexican President and agreed to a cut, though he did not confirm the exact size. He said Mexico would reimburse the US at a later date.\n\n\"It's a small amount for us, a large amount for Mexico,\" he said.\n\n\"This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States,\" Trump said in the tweet.\n\nOil futures were initially muted after news of the deal broke, though advanced during Asian trading hours. Brent, the global benchmark, was last up more than 4% to $32.78 a barrel. US oil prices moved nearly 5% higher to $23.85 a barrel.\n\nEven so, the decline in output amounts to only about 10% of the world's normal supply of oil, far below the estimates for how much demand for oil has collapsed amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs called the deal \"historic yet insufficient,\" adding that the voluntary cuts were \"still too little and too late to avoid breaching storage capacity.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, this simply reflects that no voluntary cuts could be large enough\" to offset the loss in demand, which they pegged at 19 million barrels per day on average in April and May.\n\nJeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda, called the agreement \"underwhelming,' and noted that non-OPEC+ oil producers, including the United States, Canada and Norway, have not committed on paper to \"actual cuts to production.\"\n\n\"The OPEC+ deal, although well-meaning in intent, wholeheartedly fail to address the supply/demand basis confronting the world,\" Halley added. \"It can at best only put a floor under oil prices at their March lows.\"\n\n-- CNN's Chris Liakos, John Defterios and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-3", "parent":

Doug Ducey said in a tweet that he was in contact with the tribe about its needs.\n\n\"Our tribal communities remain top of mind: I've been in touch with Navajo President Nez & Vice President Lizer about the need for supplies, personnel and ventilators,\" Ducey said in a tweet. \"Arizona is committed to assisting ALL our tribes as they fight.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Nez and Lizer said in a news release that a coronavirus test that can provide results in less than 15 minutes will soon be available at Navajo area Indian Health Service facilities and tribal operated health care centers.\n\nTests currently take two to four days to process, Nez and Lizer said in the news release.\n\n\"Quicker test results will likely result in even higher numbers of positive cases, but it will help to identify those who have the virus and begin to mitigate the cases much quicker,\" Nez said. \"We must do better.\"\n\nOther tribes are dealing with the pandemic\n\nThe Navajo Nation is not the only tribe in the United States dealing with coronavirus.\n\nAll business operations of the tribe have been suspended until May 1, including all 10 gaming and hospitality destinations, cultural museums and retail operations.\n\nThe nation declared a state of emergency on March 16 and suspended operations at all tribally owned casinos, hotels, and museums.\n\nWhile no curfews or stay at home orders are in place, all hotels and casinos were closed indefinitely on March 16.\n\nThe tribe continues to work with its supply chains in order to ensure the flow of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and its pharmacy has begun making its own hand sanitizer to try to meet demand, Humensky said.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-21", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

He said he was experiencing \"mild symptoms\" and would continue leading the country -- while self-isolating in his apartment in Downing Street. But 10 days later, the Downing Street announced the 55-year-old was not getting better and was taken to St. Thomas' Hospital in London. He was moved to an intensive care unit (ICU) the next day after his condition deteriorated.\n\n\"From what I gather -- and I wasn't there -- no one asked a doctor to mask up and physically examine him the whole time -- more than 10 days,\" Max Johnson said about the time his brother spent in self-isolation.\n\nIn response to Max Johnson's comments, Downing Street described the Prime Minister's health as a \"private matter\" adding it would be \"inaccurate\" to suggest Boris Johnson hadn't been physically examined by a doctor before entering hospital.\n\nThe PM spent three nights in intensive care and received \"standard oxygen treatment,\" according to his spokesman, but did not require mechanical or invasive ventilation.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Max Johnson said that while he was grateful for the care his brother received from the National Health Service, he wasn't pleased with the events leading up to his hospitalization. Prince William and Kate video call children at school to boost morale Boris Johnson 'able to do short walks' after moving out of ICU The Queen's master class in fighting with compassion \"He'd tested positive so there was no doubt what he was dealing with. The word 'shambles' comes to mind,\" Johnson said. \"What's the point of bodyguards when you can't have a doctor? The Office of Prime Minister needs better protection.\" Officials around the PM have expressed gratitude for all the care he's had from his National Health Service doctors. Johnson was moved out of the ICU on Thursday night. On Friday, a spokesperson said the Prime Minister was \"able to do short walks\" in between periods of rest, and waved his thanks to staff. London bus drivers are dying from coronavirus. Demands to protect them better are growing He \"is in extremely good spirits,\" the spokesperson added. Max Johnson said he was \"massively relieved\" by his brother's recovery, adding he hoped the PM would take time off to fully recover. The strength with which Covid-19 struck the Prime Minister surprised many in the UK. Johnson is known for his lively persona, so the idea of the PM being incapacitated shook the nation. Well-wishes poured in from across the political scene, with even some of Johnson's old foes expressing their hope he'd recover swiftly. Meanwhile, those leading the country's coronavirus response team said Johnson's hospitalization was a reminder of just how indiscriminate the virus can be and urged Brits to resist the good weather over the Easter weekend and stay at home. As of Saturday, 9,875 people have died the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, according to a tally by the Department of Health and Social Care. Nearly 79,000 people have have tested positive.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7",

I had a fever of 103...I was huddled up under blankets and just couldn’t get warm,\" Lambeth said.\n\nIt was his birthday that day, which he described as the beginning to the torment that followed.\n\nOn March 15, his daughter began showing symptoms. On March 16, so did his son-in-law.\n\n“You don’t think it’s going to happen to you, and then boom you got it. You hear people dying from coronavirus then you start thinking 'am I going to be next?' It’s a good thing my two little granddaughters didn’t catch it. That’s a miracle. I thank God for that,\" Lambeth said.\n\nAfter they took tests for COVID-19, the results came back positive. But by that time, Lambeth's uncle Calkins became symptomatic.\n\n“We had all stayed away, so...I really don’t know where he got it. I don’t even know where I got it,\" Lambeth said.\n\nCalkins was taken to Forsyth Medical Center on March 27 after experiencing a series of falls at home. Once he was admitted, doctors tested him for the coronavirus.\n\nWithin 24 hours, the results came back confirming he had the virus.\n\nLambeth, still coming down from the sickness, was shocked.\n\nHe spoke with his uncle on Sunday.\n\n“I said hurry up and get better. We gotta go find some places to eat...they was giving him breathing. Oxygen. He sounded okay, but he didn’t sound okay on the phone. You can tell it was him but not him,\" Lambeth said.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Calkins passed away from coronavirus.\n\nThe news was hard for Lambeth to hear, but even more difficult to explain to Calkins' wife, Ruth.\n\nShe had dementia and is currently staying in an assisted living facility. Lambeth had to share the news to her through the telephone while standing on the other side of a window.\n\n“That’s when I started to break down,” Lambeth said. “I guess, if there is a silver lining, she won’t remember it tomorrow.\"\n\nWhile Lambeth and his family have fully recovered from COVID-19, they are unable to grieve together as a family with the rest of their members.\n\nOnce the threat of coronavirus has reduce, they plan to hold a memorial to honor Calkins.\n\nUntil that time, Lambeth wants their pain to be a warning sign for others.\n\n“My prayer is people will take this serious. And stay away. If you gotta go to the food store that’s one thing...stay at home until this nasty thing gets over with,\" Lambeth said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1307574, "name": "Christina Macfarlane"}, "body": "(CNN) With the tennis calendar in disarray amid the coronavirus pandemic , Canadian star Milos Raonic hopes the rescheduling of tournaments won't be detrimental to player welfare.\n\nThe French Open has been moved from its regular May start date to September, a week after the US Open, while Wimbledon has been canceled and the WTA and ATP Tours have been suspended until July 13.\n\nThe decision to move the French Open drew criticism from a number of players, but world No. 30 Raonic says he welcomes the chance to play as many grand slams as possible -- as long as his body holds up.\n\n\"Four weeks in five (in September) ... I think that will pose issues for players, and I think also because a transition to a different surface (from hard to clay courts) will be very quick,\" he told CNN's Christina Macfarlane.\n\n\"The thing that you really hope for is that it doesn't create an uptick in injuries because that is quite tolling, quite a task.\n\n\"Am I happy that it is going to happen? Yes, I think so, to have a chance to play as many grand slams as possible in what is going to end up being a shortened season for us is a very important thing and I'm happy that a way is found to make it happen and hopefully we can get through to that point and be able to compete in those events.\"\n\nRaonic, who climbed as high as No. 3 in the rankings in 2017 before enduring a number of injury-plagued seasons, has missed the past two French Opens.\n\nRoanic adds that he would have liked more clarity when the decision was announced.\n\n\"There was just a disappointment maybe of the approach. I think a few players wished they knew a little bit earlier before. I figured it out through social media, and I'm sure many others did,\" he says.\n\n\"We have a big group chat and that's how it came out to all of us. So I think that was maybe the hardest part of it to accept. But once you got over that I think the understanding of, is it a positive thing for us? It is. That's for sure.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old Raonic, who reached the Wimbledon final in 2016, is residing in Florida as the virus lockdown continues.\n\nWhile there is some frustration that tournaments have been wiped off the schedule, for now he remains focused on building fitness and admits that tennis should take a backseat.\n\n\"I've always played a relatively light schedule, 15 or 16 tournaments only. To have big chunks of it go out, big things that in December, this is what you had your mind set on -- every single workout that's tough and you're trying to get through them,\" he says.\n\n\"Sport, as wonderful as it is, is really a minor concern for everybody nowadays. I think the health of the people around us, the communities, the world. This is something that the whole world is participating in.\n\n\"If these events do not happen, I think personally that would be tough, but I think it's something that you could get over pretty quickly when you put it in context with everything else that's going on and everything else that needs to happen.\"\n\nIn the meantime, aside from regular exercise, there are opportunities to binge watch TV, read, catch up with friends and brush up on his cooking skills.\n\nPan fried fish and vegetables is Raonic's go-to meal -- in part, he confesses, because it's \"easy to clean up.\"\n\nAll of which is helping keep him occupied while tennis is off limits.\n\n\"You keep training but you try to spread things out,\" he says.\n\n\"The fact that the focus is strictly on the fitness thing, because it is such a disassociation directly with the competition of playing points, playing sets, playing matches, that does make it a bit easier.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":
