This is not an emergency admission, but based on Johnson's doctor's advice due to his lingering symptoms.Johnson, who announced on March 27 that he had contracted the virus and would self isolate for seven days, remains at the helm of the United Kingdom's government. The spokesperson said that the prime minister is in touch with fellow officials and colleagues. \"The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government's advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,\" the spokesperson continued.As of Sunday, the UK has confirmed 48,407 cases and 4,943 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Apple may also offer reimbursements for those who need to upgrade their internet plan.The tech giant also added a new wellness tool for retail employees in recent weeks through Sanvello, a digital service for managing stress and anxiety. It's the latest mental wellness perk for Apple workers, as the company had already been offering access to the meditation app Ten Percent Happier.Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the additional resources for workers. \n\n\n\nApple said on March 13 that it would temporarily close all retail stores outside of Greater China to protect employees and customers as the coronavirus pandemic spread. That was just before states across the country began issuing policies to close nonessential businesses.  Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a memo published on March 13 that all hourly employees will continue to receive normal pay, and Apple also recently said it intends to continue paying contract workers as well, as The Wall Street Journal reported. It recently began asking retail staff to work from home to help manage the influx of customers seeking assistance with their devices, as Bloomberg first reported. The move comes as the coronavirus pandemic has sent ripples through the retail, travel, and restaurant industries and has shaken the global economy as 90% of Americans are under orders to stay at home. Hundreds of thousands of retail workers are being furloughed or laid off at major chains like Macy's, JCPenny, the Gap, and others. Companies hit hard by the pandemic, like Amtrak, La-Z-Boy, and Mattress Firm are cutting 401(k) contributions to save cash, according to The Wall Street Journal.A record number of 6.64 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week that ended on Saturday, coming after the figure spiked to an unprecedented 3.28 million the previous week.\n\n\n\nApple has not yet said when it plans to reopen its retail stores, but a report from Bloomberg suggests stores will remain closed until May. Are you currently an Apple Store employee?

If the population of a community is undercounted, it might not get the volume of coronavirus vaccine it needs, said Rob Santos, chief methodologist at the Urban Institute.\"If in a year or two years from now, we finally have vaccines, the first thing that the public health folks are going to do is they're going to look at the census counts by neighborhood and say, where do we push out vaccines?\" Santos told Business Insider Today. \"If people don't participate, then they're at risk of getting less vaccines than they should have gotten.\"It's a scenario that Census Bureau spokesman Michael Cook has hinted at in the past.\"An accurate 2020 census does bode well for times when emergency preparedness or first responders need that information,\" Cook said. \"Looking at the health industry and everything that's happening with COVID-19, the official statistics of the United States definitely will be used and come into play.\"The census has been underway since the beginning of March, and can be filled out online. Experts fear that because of the coronavirus, getting an accurate count of the US population by the December 31 deadline will be harder, with more than 75% of Americans on some form of lockdown. Historically, minority groups such as African-Americans, Latinos, people on tribal lands, the homeless, and rural populations have been the hardest to count,\" said director of national census program NALEO Educational Fund, Lizette Escobedo. \"One, they have very limited access to information around the census and around most civic engagement issues,\" Escobedo said. \"There are language barriers. And with that comes barriers to access. I think another piece is there is a huge distrust for the government.\"That is why the Census Bureau usually sends field workers to collect data but during the pandemic, it has suspended all field operations until after April 15 as it tries to figure out how to protect the army of door-knockers from COVID-19. Instead, the agency is urging folks to fill out the form online or over the phone. But despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, census officials say there is not much flexibility to extend the deadline, since the US Constitution mandates a census every 10 years. \"As a federal agency, we're obligated to conduct the census per the census law,\" Cook, the Census Bureau spokesman, said. \"So we're trying to ensure that the census is continuing because we have to conduct the census, but that when and where possible, we're making adaptations and modifications to all of our operations to ensure the safety of the public and our staff because we, just like everyone else, we're practicing social distancing, and we're ensuring we can lessen the spread of COVID-19.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

A few states have due dates in June; Mississippi's new deadline is May 15. Scroll to the bottom of this story for a state-by-state list of tax deadlines.See Business Insider's picks for the best tax software »\n\n\n\nTaxes are no longer due on April 15 in any US state.Every state has now extended its tax filing and/or tax payment due date beyond the original April deadline, Nicole Kaeding, the vice president of policy promotion and an economist at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, pointed out on Twitter on Wednesday.Last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that the federal tax deadline would be postponed 90 days, to July 15. In addition, the IRS will waive all penalties and interest on federal tax payments of up to $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses during this period. After the federal-tax deadline was extended, some states quickly followed suit. On Wednesday, New Jersey was the final state to postpone its due date, announcing a new July 15 deadline.In total, 41 states tax income, either at a flat rate — meaning everyone, regardless of how much they earn, pays the same percentage of their income to the government — or a progressive rate, which means the tax rate is determined by income.\n\n\n\nAccording to a list compiled by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, most states have pushed back both the individual income tax payment and tax filing due dates to either July or June. Mississippi's new deadline for individual income tax and corporate income tax is May 15.Seven states have no individual income tax — Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee don't have a state income tax either, but they do tax interest and dividends. Tennessee's tax due date has been extended to July 15.Below, confirm your state's individual income tax deadline (the dates emphasized are those that do not match the federal tax deadline). Note that in some cases these extensions do not apply to estimated quarterly tax payments; check your state's Department of Revenue website for more details.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

Another key Crescat fund delivered a 34.3% gain over the same period, while the SP 500 plunged by almost a third.\n\nSmith has been bearish on equities for years, noting that \"US large-cap stocks are the most overvalued in history\" in a letter to investors in November 2017. He kept 50% of the fund's assets in cash and parked money in gold and silver as stocks continued their record bull run, according to Ozy, a multimedia outlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is just 'The Big Short' again,\" Tavi Costa, Smith's co-portfolio manager, told Ozy. \"It's very difficult, and emotionally, it's just brutal.\"\n\nCrescat didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nRead more: Jefferies says these 15 stocks make the perfect buy for investors seeking quality, defense, and recovery as the coronavirus sends markets spinning\n\nSmith's Buffett-esque patience shouldn't be a surprise. His father introduced him to investing by handing him a bunch of the billionaire investor's annual shareholder letters, he told Ozy.\n\nCrescat is also based in Denver for a reason, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Buffett built his empire in Omaha,\" Smith told Ozy. \"Not having that groupthink you might find in New York City is important.\"\n\nEmbracing Buffett's long-term perspective and shunning herd mentality likely helped Smith to hold tight until stocks tumbled.\n\nRead more: RBC polled 185 investors during the worst first quarter in stock-market history. They revealed what they're buying and selling as the coronavirus crisis persists.\n\n\"The crash was coming with or without the coronavirus pandemic,\" he told investors last week.\n\n\"It started from record highs, historic leverage, and the most fundamentally overvalued composite of multiples ever, higher than 1929 and 2000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith remains net short on stocks as he expects \"much more downside\" for equities and corporate credit markets, he told investors last week. The key reasons for his bearish stance — an overvalued yuan and banking and real estate bubbles in China — remain intact.\n\nHowever, Smith is ready to switch tacks once Crescat's macro model indicates that markets and the economy have bottomed.\n\n\"We fully plan to become raging bulls,\" he said in the letter.\n\nRead more: Stocks are technically back in a bull market, but Wall Street

Just a week ago, on March 25, EPI had a much more conservative but still startling estimate: 14 million jobs lost. Two weeks ago, it estimated a now comparatively meager three million jobs lost.That was on March 17, the day after restaurants and bars across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were ordered to shut down operations with the exception of take-out and delivery orders. On March 19, California became the first US state to issue a statewide stay-at-home order. Many other states and cities have since followed suit. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Owner and chef Anthony Caldwell looks out from 50Kitchen in the Field's Corner neighborhood of Boston, MA on March 18, 2020.\n \n\n \n Craig F.

released a report forecasting that the US economy will contract for three quarters, with a cumulative GDP decline of 10.4%, as Business Insider's Carmen Reinicke reported. The unemployment rate could rise as high as 15.6%, according to the report.\"This will be the deepest recession on record, nearly five times more severe than the post-war average,\" economist Michelle Meyer wrote. Here's

But they'll need something more like a \"wartime economy\" to fight the pandemic.During World War II, the US government mobilized major industry for all the various needs of the war effort, with Ford making tanks, for example.Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on March 27, more than a week after first saying he would, to require General Motors to produce sorely needed ventilators for US hospitals.The following Thursday, April 2, he tapped six manufacturers to aid with ventilator production and one company to ramp up protective mask production. It's unclear how much equipment is being produced or where it's going.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak has killed at least 52,000 people and infected over a million people worldwide.As the pandemic has worsened, more and more political leaders have been using \"wartime\" language, at first French President Emmanuel Macron and leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and later US President Donald Trump, who called himself a \"wartime president.\"But what is a \"wartime economy?\" And what would that look like for fighting a virus outbreak instead of a military conflict, in the United States of 2020? Previously, it meant the White House invoking wartime powers that would task private industries with providing resources to help with the war effort, like Ford fulfilling government orders for 300,000 vehicles during World War II.Trump has that same power today, and finally invoked it on Friday, March 27. He had first said he would invoke the law on March 18 and then said he wanted to use it as \"leverage\" to get private industry to mobilize without an order.\n\n\n\nHe used the Defense Production Act to demand that General Motors ramp up production of ventilators for strained hospitals. And then again, on April 2, he used it to order six manufacturers to supply parts for ventilator production, and one company to produce N95 masks. It's unclear how much equipment is being produced or where it's going.Keep reading for a look at how the American \"wartime economy\" of yesteryear is taking hold in Trump's presidency.",

In the message, Trump boasted of his poll numbers and blamed a federal lawmaker for the alleged failures of New York's state government.The April 2 letter was sent in response to a request from the Senate Minority Leader for the Trump administration to invoke the Defense Production Act. That would compel the private sector to manufacture sorely needed medical equipment and designate a military official to oversee the logistics of resource distribution in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.\"This is a matter of the utmost urgency for the health of every American,\" Schumer wrote to the president earlier in the day. \"Regrettably, our national response is far behind where it should be. But by acting now, there is still time to help protect our medical professionals, reduce suffering, and save lives.\"—David Gura 🏡 (@davidgura) April 2, 2020 In response, Trump — who throughout March compared COVID-19 to the seasonal flu — dismissed the requests as \"incorrect sound bites.\"\"If you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers), and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the 'invisible enemy,\" the US president asserted.\n\n\n\nOver 2,300 people in New York state have died of COVID-19, with officials announcing 432 new deaths on Thursday — 42 percent of all coronavirus deaths nationwide, according to The New York Times, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo warning the state will run out of ventilators within a week.Despite the shortage, Trump, in his letter, claimed he did not need to invoke the Defense Production Act as the mere threat of doing so was enough to get companies to \"do whatever we are asking.\"  In a March 27 tweet, for example, he told Ford Motor Company to \"GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!\"Ford had announced days earlier that it was looking to repurpose some of its car factories to produce ventilators. The president, meanwhile, on March 30, questioned whether more production is even needed, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.\"Have a news tip?

It was originally scheduled to take place in July.—Alex Seitz-Wald (@aseitzwald) April 2, 2020 \"In our current climate of uncertainty, we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention,\" Joe Solmonese, CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee, said in a statement.He added, \"During this critical time, when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health care professionals and emergency responders.\"The previous day, former Vice President Joe Biden called for the convention to be delayed until August. He currently leads the delegate count in the 2020 Democratic primary, ahead of the only other remaining contender, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\"I doubt whether the Democratic convention is going to be able to be held in mid-July, early July,\" Biden said on The Tonight Show. \"I think it's going to have to move into August.\"\n\n\n\nThousands of delegates, journalists, politicians, operatives, and more had originally planned to descend on the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 13 to 16 to anoint their party's nominee for president.But public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control have called for social distancing procedures and discouraged gatherings of 10 people or greater to slow the spread of the coronavirus, making the packed, chaotic conditions of a national party convention untenable.In March, the New York Times reported that the Democratic party was \"exploring a range of contingency options\" in the event that the convention could not be held by traditional means.The Democratic primary process leading up to the convention had already been radically disrupted due to the coronavirus. Several states postponed their scheduled primaries until June out of concern that officials could not safely hold in-person elections.Read more: About 90% of all Americans have been ordered to stay at home.

So far, one worker in Nevada and two office workers in Palo Alto have also tested positive.According to the email obtained by The Verge, the affected employee was last in the office after March 17. Panasonic said it had traced all the affected person's contacts and performed a thorough cleaning of their work station.A Panasonic spokesperson did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but confirmed to The Verge that the two-week factory shutdown begun on March 23 will be extended. Musk previously said the factory will \"reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible.\"Tesla's joint venture with Panasonic is planned to end in May, the companies said in February, with Panasonic completely exiting the operation by September. Tesla has said it's working to \"identify and hire\" some of the 375 laid off workers.\n\n\n\nThe factory shutdowns in Buffalo, we well as Reno, Nevada and Fremont California, come after chief executive Elon Musk seemed to downplay the severity of the pandemic. In addition to tweeting that the panicked reaction to the virus was \"dumb,\" he also tweeted false information that kids \"are essentially immune\" to the disease.In closing its factories, Tesla told investors that it had plenty of cash on hand to weather the shutdown.\"Our cash position at the end of Q4 2019 was $6.3B before our recent $2.3B capital raise,\" the company said. \"We believe this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty. At the end of Q4 2019, we had available credit lines worth approximately $3B including working capital lines for all regions as well as financing for the expansion of our Shanghai factory.\"Tesla is expected to report its first-quarter vehicle sales for the period ending March 31 soon.", "categories":

To backtrack, my family and I had been living in Wuhan, China for nearly a year, prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.My husband, son, and I left China on January 14, 2020 to go on a planned vacation to Malaysia for Chinese New Year. At the time of our departure from China, we had no idea the brevity of this epidemic that would eventually become a global pandemic. When we were unable to return to China and became stuck in Malaysia for nearly a month, we were just ready to begin anew. As expats, we live worldwide. My husband coaches American football, internationally, so we decided it was time to get a new contract in a new country. This was going to be a fresh start after what we had lost, with our savings, the entire apartment, and the life we were forced to leave behind in China.He was offered a head coaching position in the Czech Republic and we decided that it would be our next destination. During that time, I had multiple opportunities including a remote job interview that required me to go back to the US — resulting in my husband and son heading to the Czech Republic without me. For my husband and I, our focus after living an unexpected extra three weeks in Malaysia was to replenish our savings and make sure that we created more opportunities for ourselves to be in a more stable position in the event of another emergency. Unfortunately, for us, the life of uncertainty, fear, and unpredictability didn't stay in Asia. It followed us all.\n\n\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Czech Republic issued a 30-day travel ban to foreigner visitors from 15 countries. I decided to book a flight for Thursday the 19th. I knew that I should head over to Europe to be with my family sooner rather than later. However, by Sunday, March 15, my husband informed me that the general manager of the team heard that the ban could extend to all foreigners.Having already purchased two flights to avoid layovers in countries on the original ban list, I was not financially in the position to change my flights or purchase a new one. I began to sell a children's book that I had written and self-published in 2019 — the bulk of my books are stuck in a warehouse in Wuhan, China. I had 30 books with me, and wanted to sell as many as possible to make any extra money I could to help me get to my family.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB6-6", "level": 2, "links":

Easter falls on April 12 this year.\"I just thought it was a beautiful time ... a beautiful time line,\" Trump said last week of why he suggested lifting restrictions by Easter.But Trump scaled back on an Easter deadline on Sunday night, saying that date was \"aspirational.\"Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said extending restrictions until the end of April was a \"wise and prudent decision.\"\n\n\n\nThe US has the most known coronavirus cases in the world, with 139,675 confirmed cases and 2,436 deaths as of Sunday night. US cases are largely concentrated in New York, which has more than 59,000 confirmed COVID-19 infections.Earlier on Sunday, Fauci appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union\" and said that while it was difficult to predict, the US would probably see \"millions of cases\" of COVID-19 and could see more than 100,000 deaths.\"But I don't want to be held to that,\" he added. \"I just don't think that we really need to make a projection, when it's such a moving target.\"Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, said in an interview with the \"Today\" show last week that if Americans did not practice social-distancing measures, up to 2 million people could die of COVID-19 in the US.\"Continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing and all of the other things about knowing where your hands are and washing your hands,\" she said.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

And how what advice does she have from the experience? Sandberg told Business Insider EIC Alyson Shontell in a recent interview.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nIn March 2008, when Sheryl Sandberg joined Facebook as its chief operating officer, the company was still a startup. And then, in September 2008, one of the largest investment banks in America suddenly collapsed. The world was rapidly thrust into a recession.It had launched just four years earlier as a service for Harvard students, created by a group of Harvard students, and was still years away from becoming the behemoth that it is today.In 2008, it was a major milestone for Facebook when it hit 100 million users. The company now has 2.9 billion users. In 2008, the company brought in $272 million in revenue, but lost $56 million. In 2019, the company reported $71 billion in revenue and brought in $7.3 billion in net income.\"We had a very small business,\" Sandberg told Business Insider EIC Alyson Shontell in an interview published Wednesday, \"but we were worried.\" So, how did a small startup like Facebook weather the storm and become a behemoth?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n \n \n Sandberg pointed to a crucial question the company's leadership had to ask itself: \"What is your core business, and what is the core service you're providing?\"\n\n\n\nFor Facebook, the answer was adapting the company's core business — advertising — to the moment. \"We took a very hard look at our ad products and redid them,\" Sandberg said. \"We really changed the pricing. We changed the ad products.\"Now it's facing a different set of headwinds as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the globe. Advertisers are spending less on advertising as people stay home and buy fewer consumer goods, which assuredly impacts Facebook's bottom line, and the company's thousands of employees are working from home. The big difference now, of course, is how Facebook is able to respond. The social media giant has a half-trillion-dollar market capitalization, and it can use its billions to help far more effectively. \"We're in a different phase now,\" Sandberg said. \"We are a large, established business. We have the ability to help, and now we are both really focused on keeping our services up and running, but also doing as much good as we can do.\"To that end, Facebook has thus far donated hundreds of millions to various causes related to coronavirus relief efforts — something it couldn't have done back in 2008. \n\n\n\nSandberg is grateful for this, she said, and has high hopes for the startups out there worried about the current crisis: \"If you do this well, you're going to be in a position to give back.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB3", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Piracy data company Muso released a report on Wednesday that shows how piracy has already increased in the region because of the closures.Visits to film piracy sites grew by 89% from January 18 to January 26, the day after the Chinese New Year, according to Muso. The company saw an overall 12.21% increase in average daily visits to piracy sites in China from January to February.Certain movies have seen a rise in piracy in China, according to Muso, such as 2011's \"Contagion\" and this year's Oscar best-picture winner, \"Parasite.\" The former saw a 151.97% increase in piracy streaming visits from January to February and the latter saw a 240.04% increase.\"Contagion,\" about a pandemic, has also surged up the iTunes charts and was the platform's ninth most popular movie on Wednesday. It's just one of several movies and TV shows about deadly viruses that have suddenly gained in popularity. The movie \"Outbreak\" and the docuseries \"Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak\" recently landed on Netflix's daily top 10 lists of its most popular titles. \n\n\n\nMuso tracked 11.2 billion visits to piracy sites globally in February and said that if China is an indication, this number will rise.China's box office was down by nearly $2 billion in the first two months of the year compared to the same time last year. Just as theaters in the region were starting to reopen, China's Film Bureau ordered them to close again last week. Theaters in the UK and Italy have also shut down amid nationwide lockdowns. Most in the US have closed as Hollywood studios delay movie releases and the box office grinds to a halt. Studios have released new movies that were recently in theaters, such as Sony's \"Bloodshot\" and Universal's \"The Invisible Man,\" to premium video-on-demand services. The movies, which viewers can usually rent or buy for $20 each, have been popular on services like iTunes and Fandango Now.But experts see this as a short-term solution to the current situation given that studios are committed to movie theaters and audiences can stream other movies at no extra cost (beyond the monthly subscription fee) on services like Netflix and HBO Now.", "categories":

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in a USA Today op-ed article published Sunday called for reopening parts of the American economy to avoid throwing it into a recession or depression, saying that \"death is an unavoidable part of life.\"Though Johnson didn't advocate fully starting up the economy, he said the crisis should be put into perspective.\"What more people are saying is that as we learn more about COVID-19, we should evaluate the total societal cost of this awful disease and try to put things into perspective,\" Johnson said.The Wisconsin senator drew a parallel between the tens of thousands of Americans who die by suicide and from drug overdoses each year, adding that \"that level of individual despair has occurred in a strong economy.\"Johnson, who sits on the Commerce and Homeland Security committees, also made a comparison to last year's \"exceptionally bad\" flu season and said Americans shouldn't overreact.\n\n\n\n\"Every premature death is a tragedy, but death is an unavoidable part of life,\" he said.Read more: RBC says coronavirus-battered stocks could plunge another 28%.

That led President Donald Trump to on Friday sign a $2 trillion economic stimulus package to extend emergency federal aid to people and businesses alike.\n\n\n\nLast week, Trump said he wanted to reopen the economy by Easter, on April 12. It would have been roughly three weeks after the administration put in place federal guidelines urging Americans to avoid traveling, eating out at restaurants, and gathering with more than 10 people.But as of Monday, the US had recorded over 143,000 coronavirus cases, the most in the world. Infectious-disease experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have said that over 100,000 Americans could die, even with aggressive action to slow the virus' spread.On Sunday evening, Trump extended the social-distancing guidelines until April 30.\"Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won,\" he said at a White House press conference, adding, \"The better you do, the

CEO Marc Benioff will receive $2.35 million, or nearly half the total. The bonuses, which will be paid around April 15, are a standard annual occurrence and reflect the executives' performances over past year. This year's payouts, however, provide a starker-than-usual contrast to conditions across the U.S. as the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged the economy, triggering mass layoffs and leading to record rates of unemployment. Benioff, who had a base salary of $1.55 million in 2019, recently called on all CEOs to take a 90-day \"no layoff pledge\" as part of an eight-point plan to deal with the coronavirus crisis. He then tweeted that Salesforce, for its part, would not to make any \"significant\" layoffs for the next 90 days, though notably did not ban them all together. Salesforce is also one of several tech companies that have committed to continuing to pay their hourly workers while offices are closed. Benioff said on the company's earnings call in late February that Salesforce would be able to withstand the impact of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, though in the company's March 9 10K filing it acknowledged several potential effects from coronavirus, including those it can't yet predict.Beyond Benioff, the board also approved cash bonuses based on corporate performance goals for CFO Mark Hawkins ($750,000), CTO and cofounder Parker Harris ($750,000), COO Bret Taylor ($675,000), and chief engineering officer Srinivas Tallapragada ($675,000).The board also approved these executives' salaries and bonuses for the 2021 fiscal year, which started February 1 and will end January 31, 2021. \n\n\n\nHere are the salaries and target bonuses for 2020 for Salesforce's top five executives:Benioff: salary of $1.55 million with 200% annual target bonusCFO Hawkins: salary of $1 million with 100% target bonus CTO Parker Harris: salary of $1 million with 100% target bonus. Chief engineering officer Srinivas Tallapragada: salary of $950,000 with 100% target bonusCOO Taylor: a salary of $1 million with 100% target bonus (Taylor became COO on December 12, 2019)Got a tip? Contact this reporter via email at pzaveri@businessinsider.com or Signal at 925-364-4258.

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2064181, "name": "Isaac Scher"}, "body": "Japan once appeared to be avoiding a full-blown epidemic, but the country has recently seen a large increase in coronavirus cases.Former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said the Japanese government failed to adequately address the viral outbreak, putting the now-cancelled 2020 Olympics above the health of citizens. In Tokyo, two viral clusters were discovered Sunday. They could be a sign that the outbreak will soon worsen.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Japan appeared to have the novel coronavirus epidemic well-contained. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the country reported zero cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, on March 11 and again less than a week later, on March 15. But by March 24, when Tokyo called off the 2020 Olympics, the virus was spreading rapidly.In Tokyo alone, Monday marked the biggest daily increase in COVID-19 cases since the epidemic began: 68 people tested positive on Sunday, March 29, according to Reuters, which cited local media. In total there have been 1,866 confirmed cases across Japan. Concerns about containment, and COVID-19 clusters, are surfacing Just three days after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided to delay this year's Olympics, Japan saw its biggest daily increase as a country: at least 225 cases emerged March 27, according to Johns Hopkins data.Some concerns have emerged about the country's containment measures, and there is speculation that mitigation strategies were delayed in order to quell fears about hosting the Olympics during an outbreak. \n\n\n\n\"In order to make an impression that the city was taking control of the coronavirus, Tokyo avoided making strict requests and made the number of patients look smaller,\" tweeted former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, whose administration Abe once called \"a nightmare\".\"The coronavirus has spread while they waited,\" Hatoyama added. \"[For Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike] it was Olympics first, not Tokyo's residents.\" A day after the Olympics was postponed, Gov. Koike said Tokyo residents should stay home on weekends until at least mid-April, Japan Times reported. \"To avoid an overshoot in infections, the cooperation of Tokyo residents is critical. I ask you to act with a sense of crisis,\" she said. Tokyo's residents may face an increased risk of infection: at least two viral clusters have recently emerged, according to local broadcaster NHK. More than 20 cases were confirmed in a hospital in Taito, an eastern Tokyo ward that has already seen many staff and patient infections. \n\n\n\nAnother cluster was reported in a home for people with disabilities in Chiba prefecture, near Tokyo. Sunday saw 28 confirmed cases there. Japan is currently only testing people with symptoms, and those connected to clusters. As in the US, the stringent testing requirements reflect officials' concern that widespread testing would overwhelm the healthcare system.But the clusters signal that the outbreak could worsen in the immediate future. \"Once infections overshoot, our strategy … will instantly fall apart,\" Abe said, adding that Japan's health crisis could soon be comparable to the US or Europe's. \"Under the current situation, we are just barely holding up.\"Last week Abe convened a task force to consider declaring a state of emergency. People should \"be prepared for a long battle,\" he said.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-20", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Johnson wrote.\"We will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do.\"\"It's important for me to level with you - we know things will get worse

John Bel Edwards said the state was seeing a worrying \"trajectory\" that could see an exhausted supply of ventilators by \"about the fourth or fifth of April,\" before running out of hospital beds days later. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the state is \"going to be in dire straits again in a matter of days\" as some hospitals are \"already at capacity.\"Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Sunday that the state was facing a concerning surge in cases of the novel coronavirus and could overwhelm the healthcare system by early April. Edwards said on ABC's \"This Week\" that the state is facing a worrying \"trajectory\" that includes a \"spread that is growing faster than we would like to see.\" \"We remain on a trajectory, really, to overwhelm our capacity to deliver health care,\" Edwards said.By the end of the first week in April, officials' \"first real issue is going to be ventilators,\" Edwards said.\"And we think it's about the fourth or fifth of April before, down in the New Orleans area, we're unable to put people on ventilators who need them,\" Edwards said. \"And then several days later, we will be out of beds.\"\n\n\n\nThe governor issued a stay-at-home order last week after Mardi Gras celebrations in late February attracted thousands of residents and tourists to the city, which has been referenced by experts as a key factor in the city's outbreak.Louisiana has since identified 3,315 cases and 137 deaths. Since the outbreak, 927 people have been hospitalized and 336 put on ventilators, according to the state's health department.—This Week (@ThisWeekABC) March 29, 2020 Edwards also appeared on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" where Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the state is \"going to be in dire straits again in a matter of days\" as some hospitals are \"already at capacity.\" —Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) March 29, 2020 Whitmer has been vocal about what she describes as her state's inability to access supplies to confront the virus. On March 28, the White House approved Michigan's request for an emergency declaration after President Donald Trump had traded multiple jabs with Whitmer online and on television as she raised criticisms over his handling of the crisis. As of March 29, Michigan had identified at least 4,659 confirmed cases and 111 deaths.\n\n\n\nWhitmer and Edwards are two of the governors who have bristled under the president's comments about measures like travel bans and lockdowns in addition to pushing Trump for expanded resources like under the Defense Production Act, which would employ private companies to manufacture needed medical supplies, including masks and ventilators. States have encouraged residents to abide by strict social distancing and isolation guidelines to reduce the chances of spreading infection and \"flatten the curve\" of rises in cases to avoid overwhelming hospitals.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Today's action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives.\"Trump had technically already invoked the Korean War-era law, which allows the federal government to pressure the private sector into producing supplies necessary for the national defense. But despite claims to the contrary from the president, Trump hadn't actually used it up until Friday.\n\n\n\nThe president in recent days was under increasing pressure from congressional lawmakers and governors, such as Andrew Cuomo of New York, to fully activate the law in order to help states obtain desperately-needed medical supplies. But even after declaring himself a \"wartime president\" due to coronavirus, Trump for days resisted tapping into his powers under the Defense Production Act. He falsely contended it would amount to nationalizing private industry in the US, and maintained that the private sector was already doing enough to fill the gaps in terms of what states needed. In tweets on Friday, Trump shifted his tone and attacked General Motors and Ford over the issues with ventilators and threatened to use the Defense Production Act. —Donald J.

The president on Thursday night told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he didn't think states like New York needed as many ventilators as they've requested, even though reports have made clear hospitals in New York City are already overwhelmed and undersupplied due to the pandemic.The US now has the highest number of reported coronavirus cases in the world — over 94,000.\n\n\n\nTrump on Friday also signed a $2.2 trillion relief bill aimed at addressing the myriad economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-5", "parent": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11"}, "score": 0.29, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": true, "id": "IAB11", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11", "parent": null}, "score": 0.11, "taxonomy": "iab-qag"}, {"confident": false, "id": "11000000", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/11000000", "parent": null}, "score": 0.05, "taxonomy": "iptc-subjectcode"}], "characters_count": 3537, "entities": {"body": [{"indices": [[2108, 2119]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Cuomo"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "Andrew Cuomo", "types": ["OfficeHolder", "Agent", "Person", "Politician"]}, {"indices": [[3066, 3073]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fox_News"}, "score": 0.999916136264801, "text": "Fox News", "types": ["Organisation", "Agent", "TelevisionStation", "Broadcaster"]}, {"indices": [[3229, 3241]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City"}, "score": 0.9999934434890747, "text": "New York City", "types": ["Location", "Settlement", "Place", "City", "PopulatedPlace"]}, {"indices": [[2124, 2131], [3122, 3129], [3229, 3236]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_(state)"}, "score": 0.672448992729187, "text": "New York", "types": ["Location", "Settlement", "AdministrativeRegion", "Place", "Region", "PopulatedPlace"]}, {"indices": [[35, 46], [692, 703]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Trump"}, "score": 0.9996018409729004, "text": "Donald Trump", "types": ["President", "Agent", "Businessman", "Person", "Politician"]}, {"indices": [[3451, 3454]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_(law)"}, "score": 0.8844664692878723, "text": "bill", "types": ["Bird", "Legislation"]}, {"indices": [[96, 109], [760, 773], [1225, 1238], [2637, 2650]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_Motors"}, "score": 0.9997276663780212, "text": "General Motors", "types": ["Corporation", "Organisation", "Agent", "Company"]}, {"indices": [[405, 420], [1874, 1889]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military"}, "score": 0.8263953328132629, "text": "national defense", "types": ["Forces", "MilitaryUnit", "MusicGenre"]}, {"indices": [[633, 648]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business_Insider"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "Business Insider", "types": ["Work", "Product", "Business", "Website", "Company", "Organisation"]}, {"indices": [[3076, 3087]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sean_Hannity"}, "score": 0.9956503510475159, "text": "Sean Hannity", "types": ["Radio", "Agent", "Person"]}, {"indices": [[928, 936]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Automotive_industry"}, "score": 0.9621953368186951, "text": "automaker", "types": ["Range", "MusicGenre"]}, {"indices": [[1456, 1460]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virus"}, "score": 0.9932901263237, "text": "virus", "types": ["Species", "Agent", "Animal"]}, {"indices": [[842, 849], [3296, 3303], [3528, 3535]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandemic"}, "score": 0.9948405027389526, "text": "pandemic", "types": ["Arachnid", "Epidemic"]}, {"indices": [[2656, 2659]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ford_Motor_Company"}, "score": 0.9954179525375366, "text": "Ford", "types": ["Organisation", "Agent", "Automaker", "Company"]}, {"indices": [[156, 166], [830, 840], [2290, 2300], [3351, 3361], [3516, 3526]], "links": {"dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronavirus"}, "score": 1.0, "text": "coronavirus", "types": ["Species", "Eukaryote"]}, {"indices": [[2463, 2464], [3309, 3310]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "US", "types": ["Place"]}, {"indices": [[2752, 2759], [2802, 2809], [2852, 2859]], "links": null, "score": null, "text": "J.

Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who almost delayed the coronavirus relief package's passage by requiring a formal vote. The $2 trillion plan passed in the House Friday afternoon, despite Massey's call for a recorded vote. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nAmerican politicians on opposite sides of the aisle don't tend to agree on much in today's political climate. But on Friday, politicians from the GOP and the Democratic party, including President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State John Kerry, came together in a series of curse-laden tweets.The unlikely coalition came together in frustration with Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who called for a recorded vote to pass the $2 trillion bipartisan coronavirus emergency relief package. Massie's insistence that all members of the House be present to formally vote on the bill would have forced many representatives to travel back to Washington, DC from their home districts and further delayed the stimulus, Politico reported.Trump tweeted that the Kentucky Republican was a \"third rate Grandstander\" who \"just wants the publicity.\" Kerry, who has long been a foe of the president, shared the tweet in agreement. \"Breaking news: Congressman Massie has tested positive for being an a-shole,\" Kerry said in a tweet. \"He must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his massive stupidity. He's given new meaning to the term #Masshole. (Finally, something the president and I can agree on!)\" —John Kerry (@JohnKerry) March 27, 2020The budding friendship continued as Trump tweeted that he \"never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor.\"Liberal Twitter personality Dr. Eugene Gu was one of many to marvel at this unlikely pairing. \n\n\n\n—Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) March 27, 2020Writer Rick Wilson sang the same tune, writing, \"Who knew it would be Thomas Massie who united America at long last?\" —Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) March 27, 2020 Massie defended his decision to delay the vote in a series of tweets, arguing that it was his constitutional responsibility to ensure a quorum would formally vote on the stimulus package. —Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 27, 2020In a comment to Politico, he said, \"You know what, there are a lot who aren't mad at me.

Contact tracers believe it started with a healthcare professional working at the home, who had symptoms of the coronavirus.Within a week, seven residents had testing positive after showing symptoms. Others later developed symptoms, and also tested positive. As the epidemic escalated, the home started conducting blanket tests, including on residents who did not show any symptoms, eventually testing 76 of the 82 people in the facility. Three refused to be tested, two were already in hospital being treated for the disease by the time testing began, and one was not available for testing.According to the report, a third (23) of them tested positive, but 13 of them had no symptoms at all. Of those who did exhibit symptoms, eight had typical symptoms, but two had more unusual symptoms: melancholy and nausea.A week later, 10 of the 13 with asymptomatic cases had developed symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe report does have limitations. It only addresses a single long-term care facility, and its authors acknowledge it can be difficulty to accurately assess symptoms among patients with dementia and other forms of cognitive decline.But the novel coronavirus is already known to spread rapidly, particularly under close confines such as a care facility or nursing home.Currently, attempts to slow the spread of the virus primarily rely on common symptoms like fever, coughing, and shortness of breath to identify and isolate new cases.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-15", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

It's definitely not Costco, and that's all I have to say.\"Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nThere's nothing unusual about an $18 to $20 gourmet pizza from an upscale wine bar. But there's definitely something unusual about passing off a $2 to $2.50 frozen pizza from Costco as an $18 to $20 gourmet pizza from an upscale wine bar.That's what may have been happening at Charleston, South Carolina restaurant Coquin, the Post and Courier first reported.Coquin opened in October 2019 as a neighborhood tapas and wine bar. Since the coronavirus pandemic prompted sweeping restaurant shutdowns, Coquin, like many other restaurants, has pivoted to delivery. Grimalda told the Post and Courier that he hasn't had to lay off any employees yet, saying the staff is \"all kind of busting our butts\" to get by.But this week, diners and Coquin employees tipped off the Post and Courier, saying the $18 to $20 pizzas that Coquin was selling for delivery were actually just frozen Costco pizzas.Coquin started selling the pizzas on its website last weekend, marketing them on the restaurant's Instagram. The restaurant's owner, Chip Grimalda, says that Coquin has since sold around 20 pizzas a day.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIs there a better combo than $20 Pizza and $10 Frosè??

Email acain@businessinsider.com.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nA total of 144 passengers and crew members have fallen ill aboard the MS Zaandam, a Holland America Line cruise ship stranded off the coast of South America, according to passengers on board.Previously, the cruise line reported that 13 guests and 29 crew members were exhibiting \"influenza-like symptoms.\" Now, passengers on board told Business Insider that the numbers have jumped to 86 crew members and 58 passengers.Holland America did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment, although they did post an update to the line's official Facebook page on March 24. The outbreak of illness has not yet been identified as COVID-19, as the Zaandam does not have coronavirus testing capacity on board. Holland America has dispatched the MS Rotterdam to supply the Zaandam with COVID-19 testing kits and other medical supplies.\"As all ports along Zaandam's route are closed to cruise ships, Holland America Line has deployed Rotterdam to rendezvous with Zaandam and provide extra supplies, staff, COVID-19 test kits and other support as needed,\" Holland America said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"Carrying 611 crew and no guests, Rotterdam departed Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, at 3 p.m. local time on March 22 and the current schedule is for the two ships to meet by the evening of March 26 off the coast of Panama.\"\n\n\n\nThe cruise is currently located off the coast of Ecuador, according to the ship-tracking website Vessel Finder. There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew members on board.Passengers were confined to their state rooms on March 22, with crew members relegated to delivering meals and collecting trash from each cabin. But concerns over the ship's sanitary measures have already arisen. Australia's 9 News published photos posted on Facebook of \"crew members packed tightly together in a narrow corridor while collecting passengers' meal trays.\"—L Bodley (@BodleyL) March 25, 2020 The cruise on the Zaandam was scheduled to last 14 days, embarking from Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and set to end in San Antonio, Chile, this past Saturday. Those plans were diverted because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the cruise ship rerouted its course to sail north to an undetermined destination.Currently, the ship is attempting to secure \"a reservation to transit the Panama Canal\" with the intention of sailing up to Fort Lauderdale, Florida for a March 30 arrival. The Panama Canal Authority declined to comment about whether or not the ship will be permitted to sail through the canal, and the US Embassy in Panama did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Are you a cruise ship passenger or employee with a story to share?

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 944598, "name": "Akin Oyedele"}, "body": "Laszlo Birinyi is taking a cautious approach to the stock market, even as it attempts to recover from the coronavirus-driven slump.In a recent client letter, he explained why he does not expect a so-called V-shaped recovery and shared seven nuggets of advice for managing portfolios at this time. Click here for more BI Prime stories. \n\n\n\nLaszlo Birinyi is one of the most steadfast bulls on Wall Street. But these days, \"cautious optimism\" is how he describes his investing approach.The president of Birinyi Associates was relieved to see the stock market's bounces this week, after the coronavirus pandemic triggered the S 500's fastest 30% decline in history. And yet, he saw the so-called relief rallies as opportunities to sell — advice that his clients may not have received just a few months ago.Birinyi is skeptical of the stock market's attempts to rebound because the economy's recovery is still very much in doubt, and there is still no concrete response to the epidemic. And he's someone whose views are worth heeding, having nailed his predictions throughout the 11-year equity bull market, including calling the bottom in March 2009.There's no shortage of evidence to back up Birinyi's concern: first-time unemployment claims are at historic highs, entire industries are pleading for federal bailouts, and Congress is in the process of authorizing direct deposits that will replace lost income for millions of Americans. \n\n\n\nAll this is in addition to the fact that the daily rate of new coronavirus infections — represented by the widely touted curve — is still not slowing in the US. Beyond the economic fundamentals, Birinyi is taken aback by the market's whipsawing in recent days.The swings are indicative of how much uncertainty they investors face. Take Friday March 20 for example, when the Nasdaq was at its 5% limit up in premarket trading but ultimately closed down nearly 4%. \"Based on all of the above, investors should not even entertain the idea of a V-shaped recovery and the thought that the market will bottom before the economy or before the virus is, we think, wishful thinking,\" Birinyi said in his monthly newsletter to clients.  He further outlined seven ways his firm is managing its portfolios in light of their expectation for more volatility. \n\n\n\nDo not make any dramatic moves unless forced: A 'keep calm and carry on' approach to your portfolio is advised even if, like Birinyi, you've managed to lose less than the market during this period. Stay away from market analysis and commentary if possible: This crisis has no parallels to history, as far as Birinyi is concerned. Sell certain winners: Look for the weak link in your portfolio. This could be a stock that previously performed in line with the market but is now on the verge of becoming a loser.Sell stocks which are less than 1% of your portfolio: They're unlikely to move your performance needle on the way up or down. So rather focus on names that matter. Avoid virus 'plays': His cursory look at some lists of stock recommendations show that the gains are usually concentrated in a few names. Do not buy exotic exchange-traded funds: For example, an ETF that buys stocks with high dividend yields will purchase more during a sell-off. That's because dividend yields increase as stock prices go down. And soon enough, the ETF will lose value as well. If you must, buy individual stocks: AMD, Adobe, and Broadcom are a few tech picks that Birinyi singles out as bargains.", "categories": [{"confident":

And it's especially hard to show real estate.Brokers around the country are navigating statewide lockdowns and shelter-in-home orders as open houses are canceled and prospective buyers remain on the sidelines amid both virus and recession fears.While the fate of the housing market is still uncertain, some industry professionals are making predictions. Frederick Warburg Peters, the CEO of New York-based Warburg Realty, said he believes New York City's housing market will react to the pandemic much like it did after 9/11 and the 2008 recession. \"Like 9/11, I think we will see several months' with a lack of activity in the real estate markets in NYC, followed by a quick pick-up once life in the city begins to return to normal,\" He explained. \"And like 2008, I think prices will initially take a hit of anywhere from 10% to 20%, depending on how long we are all sheltering in place, then begin to climb back.\"\n\n\n\nPeters said he doesn't expect prices to shoot back up once shelter-in-place is lifted. Instead, he said he believes that over the course of a year or two, prices will adjust back to where they were on February 15 of this year.But for now, brokers are trying new things to counteract the pandemic's effect on their business.As Curbed reported, brokerages like New York-based Ideal Properties Group and Brown Harris Stevens are encouraging agents to offer virtual tours. In fact, a team from Compass has gone as far as partnering with RICOH Tours to stream open houses.As for broker Tania Isacoff Friedland of Warburg Realty, being prepared requires being creative. \"We are all trying our best to keep our current deals on track and facilitate as many closings that can be held remotely as possible that were previously scheduled during this time,\" she explained. \"I am speaking to my clients by phone and in some cases video conferences. We are working on ways to do virtual showings via Facetime or recorded video tours. Constant communication during these unprecedented times is key.\"Since REBNY and StreetEasy have stopped counting the number of days a property has been on the market, in an attempt to help brokerages during these uncertain times, Friedland is keeping her listings active. She is also using this time to incorporate more technology into her marketing strategy — eblasts, videos, and virtual tours — and stresses the importance of keeping in contact with clients.\n\n\n\n\"Don't sit back and wait for social distancing to end to resume working,\" she said. \"This is the time when we as brokers should be in constant contact with our customers and clients to reassure them and guide them on the rapidly evolving market conditions.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB21-3", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Temporary workers are a subset of these, and are typically brought on for a one-year fixed-length contract, which can be extended for a maximum of two years.As COVID-19, the coronavirus disease, has rocked businesses around the globe and sparked an severe and unexpected economic downturn, some Googlers have voiced concerns internally about what this might mean for temps whose contracts are expiring and may be forced to look for new jobs in an uncertain economy. Last week, one temp highlighted data on an internal company forum indicating that more than 600 other temp workers were due to end their roles at Google in the space of a single week as the pandemic grew.After Business Insider reached out to Google for comment, a spokesperson said that Google has decided to extend the assignments of all temporary workers with contracts that end between March 20 and May 15 if they are legally able to, for an additional 60 days. \n\n\n\nThe company also informed workers of the change on Tuesday. \"During the normal course of business, many temporary assignments are extended beyond their initial one year management — these extensions will proceed as normal,\" Google told workers.\"However, to support our temporary workforce during this unprecedented time, all temporary staff assignments that are scheduled to end from March 20, 2020, through May 15, 2020 will be automatically extended by 60 days from their original end date. This includes assignments that have reached their maximum length-of-service, where legally allowed.\"Google also previously set up a fund that would offer paid sick leave to contractors and temp workers who couldn't work due to COVID-19 symptoms or quarantines.Do you work at Google, Facebook, or another Silicon Valley tech firm?

The form, which can be printed from the internet, requires citizens to write down their full name, permanent residence, time of movement, and reason for movement.To help enforce the restrictions, the country is employing surveillance drones and helicopters.

But they technically stayed open for two days after that, just so customers could pick up iPhones or other devices that had been left for repairs, an Apple spokesperson tells Business Insider.The company tried to contact customers with devices being repaired at Apple Stores via phone and email, the spokesperson said, and many took the chance to pick up their devices. Inevitably, either some customers missed Apple's attempts, or the two-day pickup window wasn't enough time for them to make the trip. Some customers did not pick up their devices within the two-day pickup period, and those devices are still in Apple Stores, the spokesperson said. For those customers, their iPhones, Macs, Apples Watches and other devices are essentially stuck in a closed Apple Store for an undisclosed amount of time. Apple's original timeline to re-open its stores was Friday, March 27. That's now changed to \"until further notice\" as of March 17. The latest rumor surrounding Apple Stores is that Apple will start re-opening its stores in early April on a staggered basis, according to a March 24 Bloomberg report.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for those who missed the pickup window, there's no way for them to get their devices until Apple Stores re-open, the spokesperson said.As for those who's devices were sent out to Apple repair centers, the company is getting in touch with those customers to have their devices returned to them, rather than the normal route of having them shipped to an Apple Store for pickup.Do you have a device that's stuck indefinitely at an Apple Store during the pandemic?

On its face, the increase suggests that the virus, and dire healthcare conditions a surge of patients has led to, could be more deadly than people originally suspected.However, the global death rate doesn't necessarily tell the full story.In a press conference Monday, Dr. Deborah Birx, who serves as coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, called the figure a \"tyranny of averages,\" noting that it varies significantly depending on country, age group, and whether a patient had preexisting conditions. \n\n\n\nIn Italy, which outside of China has been hit the hardest by the virus, the death rate was 9.5% as of March 23, according to Johns Hopkins — likely due in part to the country's aging population. Meanwhile, in South Korea, where the number of new cases reported has declined since February 29, the rate was around 1.2%.The death rate in the US is also roughly 1.2%, though that could change as it ramps up testing efforts, which have lagged far behind those of other countries due to a litany of errors and delays (yet has ramped up dramatically in regions like New York).Older age groups are also disproportionately at risk from the disease: 80% of US coronavirus deaths have been among people 65 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a finding that tracks with early reports from China and South Korea.The global rate also fails to account for preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, that may increase risk of death from the coronavirus.Still, a rising global fatality rate paints a troubling picture as the virus continues to spread. Here's how the figure has evolved over time and how it varies across different parts of the world's population.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

To qualify for the program, a business needs only to meet the Small Business Administration's definition of a \"small business\" for a specific industry.\"As with all of our tenants, entrepreneurs and small businesses play an incredibly important role in our local economy, which has been central to Dan Gilbert's vision over the last 10 years of his investments in Detroit and Cleveland,\" Bedrock CEO Matt Cullen said in a statement. \"It is going to take the entire community to mitigate the effects of this pandemic on the region, and we are happy to do our part to help our portfolio's most vulnerable businesses weather the storm.In Detroit, Bedrock houses 125 retailers and restaurants, in addition to another 210 businesses in office space, according to a press release. It is unclear how many of those businesses would qualify for the firm's rent forgiveness program. The company said in a statement that none of the small businesses it leases space to had folded due to the virus thus far.Detroit's theaters, gyms, bars, salons, and casinos were closed by an executive order from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on March 16, The Detroit Free Press reported, while restaurants have been limited to only serving food for take out. The closures, which are currently slated to continue until April 13, are a part of the social distancing strategy that aims to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus to a pace that will not overwhelm the United States' healthcare system.\n\n\n\nThe downtime could be detrimental to small businesses, the majority of which only have enough cash reserves to survive for 15 days without additional revenues, a JPMorgan study found. Since originating in Wuhan, China, in December, the virus has already infected over 392,000 people and killed over 17,000, including 553 in the United States.Gilbert built his $6.46 billion fortune after cofounding Quicken Loans in 1985 with money he made from delivering pizzas, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Quicken is now the largest mortgage lender in the United States, Bloomberg reports.

He added that Amazon is working with the local health department to determine what the effect may be on other employees.The Oklahoma City Health Department was not immediately available for comment and Amazon did not return Business Insider's multiple requests for comment.This is the second-known Amazon fulfillment worker to be diagnosed. Amazon confirmed the first case — an associate in Queens, New York — on March 18 to The Atlantic. \n\n\n\nRecent studies show just how damaging coronavirus can be. About 0.1% of people who get the seasonal flu die, but the coronavirus' death rate is now at about 3.4%. Even those who recover from coronavirus may have 20% to 30% less lung capacity, causing survivors to gasp for breath while walking, doctors in Hong Kong have found. Amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has infected 41,000 people in the US and killed more than 500, Amazon has seen online orders balloon as more Americans depend on the company for bottled water, cleaning supplies, and other essentials. Many are staying at home under government order or advisement, so they're relying on e-commerce more than ever.In order to keep goods moving, Amazon is hiring an extra 100,000 warehouse workers and boosting pay by $2 an hour. The Seattle-based retail giant is also suspending shipments of all nonessential products to its warehouses as a way to deal with the increased workloads. Amazon will focus on shipping out medical supplies, household staples, and other high-demand products to its warehouses until April 5.But the consequences of Amazon warehouse workers having the coronavirus, which can take up to two weeks to exhibit symptoms, could have a frightening chain effect on the millions of Americans who buy from Amazon yearly. \n\n\n\nThe coronavirus could jump from a warehouse associate to a driver, who then may interact with a customer, or those employees may infect each other while at work, according to Dale Rogers, who is a professor of supply-chain management at Arizona State University. Rogers told The Atlantic's Olga Khazan that these interactions \"could be catastrophic.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB22-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Barclays ranked as the seventh-biggest investment bank in the world in 2018, according to the latest Coalition figures available. Barclays isn't the only trading desk that's done well. JPMorgan has notched record volumes across a number of trading desks as clients looked to change their positions. Visit BI Prime for more stories.\n\n\n\nBarclays' traders turned in a monster trading day in the latest sign that the market rout has been good for Wall Street trading desks. The bank's global markets business reaped about $250 million in revenue last Monday, March 16, according to people with knowledge of the performance. The revenue gains came across the trading franchise, including equity derivatives, according to one of the people. For Barclays, the performance bolsters CEO Jes Staley's decision to stand by the British bank's market-making businesses in spite of shareholder pressure to get rid of the units. Staley, a former chief of JPMorgan's investment bank, has committed to the business and communicated a vision for Barclays to be one of the only European banks with a top-tier investment bank. Barclays' performance came a day after the Federal Reserve made a surprise decision last Sunday to slash interest rates to near zero to help bolster a US economy reeling from the coronavirus and government demands for some citizens to shelter in place. Prices for bonds rise when interest rates fall, providing a boost to inventory banks may have on their balance sheets. Barclays was the 7th-ranked investment bank through 2018, according to data provider Coalition Ltd. Rankings for 2019 aren't available yet. \n\n\n\nThe bank's franchise in G10 rates, G10 foreign exchange, credit, and prime brokerage all ranked between fourth and sixth, the highest rankings of any of its trading businesses, according to the Coalition data. Barclays isn't the only trading operation to do well. On March 10, Bloomberg reported JPMorgan and Citigroup had brought in about $500 million more in revenue this year as at the same time last year across their equity derivatives franchises. The wire service said trading spiked as investors moved to protect their stock portfolios from historic declines. At JPMorgan, trading volumes reached records across many products, a person who has seen the figures told Business Insider. On March 9, the bank traded a record amount of shares in the US. In foreign-exchange, four of JPMorgan's top 10 all-time volume days were in a two-week period at the end of February and into March, the figures show. Trading in interest rates, futures, and algorithmic execution all reached records as well. Banks are taking advantage of nearly unprecedented moves in markets. The US stock market is now in bear market territory after slumping more than 30% from the highs of the year on fears the coronavirus will bring economic life to a standstill. The market moves have brought a huge amount of volatility to the markets as well, which can make it difficult for trading desks to manage. One the day Barclays made its money, the CBOE Volatility Index, known as the VIX, spiked near levels last seen in 2008. \n\n\n\nThe VIX, surged to as high as 76 that day, short of the index high of nearly 90, set in October 2008. Two weeks ago, the VIX surged to its highest level since December 2008, and it has remained elevated since. It closed Monday near 63.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13", "parent": null}, "score":

Previously, patients have had to wait days for a diagnosis.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has approved a coronavirus test that can deliver a diagnosis in 45 minutes. The test, made by California-based Cepheid, got emergency clearance on Saturday, eight days after the agency gave fast-track approval for a test by Roche, which can diagnose the novel coronavirus within three hours. Medical-equipment giant Thermo Fisher also has a test on the market.The approval is part of a concerted effort to make up for lost time after delays, a flawed test, and then a global shortage of the essential chemicals needed to make a new test meant the US was testing its citizens at a far slower rate than other countries. States are now also implementing drive-through tests, which have proven successful in other countries, including South Korea.The Cepheid test will be dispatched next week — first to hospitals, but the FDA's emergency clearance means it can be used in all care settings.Crucially, providers will not need training to administer the test, which is processed on one of Cepheid's GeneXpert testing system, of which there are 23,000 worldwide and 5,000 in the US. \n\n\n\n\"An accurate test delivered close to the patient can be transformative — and help alleviate the pressure that the emergence of the 2019-nCoV outbreak has put on healthcare facilities that need to properly allocate their respiratory isolation resources,\" David Persing, chief medical and technology officer at Cepheid, said in a statement.Read more: The US is struggling to ramp up testing for the coronavirus.

drones on March 15, France has been quick to follow.On Thursday March 19, a drone was seen flying over Nice's city center and main roads at around 2:30 pm, urging people to comply with containment measures.", "\"The company responsible for the drones, Drone 06, explains on its website that it specializes in aerial photography using civilian drones.The private company, based in Nice, offered its services to the region's law enforcement, so there are now small drones flying over the city.Each drone weighs in at 800 grams (about 1.7 lbs) and measures 30 centimeters (about a foot) in diameter, a company spokesperson told Le Parisien.According to local publication, Nice Matin, the devices are being trialed in Nice and will then go on to be tested in other towns in the region.", "Read more:

It was striking that this came, that this, forgive me, bulls--t attack on fake news came just moments after the secretary of state said that the American people have to be careful about where they get their information.\"He added, \"That was a 100% legitimate question with no hype, no shade, no bias — [Trump] just wanted to attack.\" \n\n\n\n—Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) March 20, 2020Alexander pushed back on Trump's positive spin concerning potential drugs that may be used to treat coronavirus patients. Trump said he doesn't know whether the drugs will be effective, but insisted he had a \"good feeling about it.\" \"What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?\" Alexander asked. \"I say that you're a terrible reporter, that's what I say,\" Trump responded. \"I think it's a very nasty question, and I thikn it's a very bad signal you're putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope.\" Trump went on to defend his positive spin.\"Let's see if it works, it might and it might not,\" he said of the drugs. \"I happen to feel good about it, but who knows? I've been right a lot.\" \n\n\n\nCNN White House reporter Kaitlin Collins challenged Trump's remarks about Alexander later in the briefing. \"Do you really think going off on Peter, going off on a network, is appropriate when the country's going through something like this?\" Collins asked. \"I do,\" Trump responded. Alexander later responded with a statement defending his question, which he called a \"softball.\" \"I was trying to provide the president an opportunity to reassure ... millions of Americans,\" he said. \"I think it does sort of reveal a frustration, perhaps an anxiety of his political prospects, about a situation that is hard to keep in control as we witnessed it continue to spiral at this time.\"\n\n\n\n—Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) March 20, 2020—Kyle Griffin

public facing health officials in the federal government when it comes to the coronavirus response.Normally stoic and even-keeled, Dr. Fauci briefly broke his poker face during Friday's press briefing.When President Donald Trump was on a tangent and joking about the State Department — calling it \"The Deep State Department,\" alluding to an unsubstantiated conspiracy against him by civil servants — Fauci covered his face.The moment did not go unnoticed on social media, with clips being shared on Twitter almost immediately afterwards.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci has been a stoic and even-keeled public facing official in the federal government's response to the coronavirus outbreak, but one quip from President Donald Trump during a Friday press conference broke his poker face. Fauci, 79, has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has become a household name since COVID-19 began dominating the news cycle as it continues to spread worldwide. The infectious disease expert took questions at a few points during the briefing and remained steadfast by President Trump's side, except for when the president went on a tangent about the State Department. —Brandon Wall (@Walldo) March 20, 2020When Trump referred to it as \"The Deep State Department,\" Fauci glanced to his right and appeared to chuckle to himself before covering his face with his palm. Shortly afterwards, Twitter began lighting up with users weighing in on the \"Fauci Facepalm.\"\n\n\n\nMany shared the image or video by saying some variation of \"Dr. Fauci is all of us right now,\" with the moment caught on camera becoming its own meme. Others mocked Fauci for touching his face, with one of the earliest CDC guidances advising Americans to avoid doing so because of how COVID-19 spreads on commonly touched surfaces. —Ed Solomon (@ed_solomon) March 20, 2020 Some seemed to think Fauci was in on Trump's joke to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was facing questions from reporters during the press conference on his reported penchant to lash out at journalists. Earlier in the press conference, Fauci was undercut by Trump on whether an unapproved treatment for the coronavirus is safe. The doctor has been a staple of most televised federal responses to the outbreak, and has often found himself having to toe the line between getting accurate information out to the public and not undermining the president, whose message has often differed from that of public health experts.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-5", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-5", "parent":

Richard Burr of North Carolina unloaded hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks after publicly downplaying the enormous risk of the novel coronavirus, ProPublica reported.According to the investigation, Burr dumped between $582,029 and $1.56 million in holdings on February 13, shortly after reassuring the public that the US was well prepared to respond to the disease.The US \"is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump Administration,\" Burr wrote on February 7.NPR also recently revealed that it had obtained a recording featuring Burr raising dire concerns about the coronavirus to members of a private Washington club.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nRepublican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina unloaded hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks shortly after publicly downplaying the enormous risk of the novel coronavirus, ProPublica reported.According to the investigation, Burr dumped between $582,029 and $1.56 million in holdings shortly after reassuring the public that the US was well prepared to respond to the disease.Burr is the chairman of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, which has access to the federal government's most classified and sensitive information. According to Reuters, Burr's committee was getting daily briefings on the threat of the coronavirus around the time he dumped his stock.In a February 7 op-ed for Fox News, Burr — along with fellow Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee — acknowledged that \"Americans are rightfully concerned about the coronavirus\" at a time when the number of cases in China were still skyrocketing.The senators also wrote, \"Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump Administration.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Burr's financial disclosure form, he started dumping stock on February 13, six days after writing that op-ed.He made a total of 29 separate transactions. Seven of those were for amounts between $1,001 and $15,000; 15 transactions were for amounts between $15,001 and $50,000; and seven were for amounts between $50,001 and $100,000.ProPublica's report comes hours after NPR revealed that it had obtained a recording featuring Burr raising dire concerns about the coronavirus to members of a private Washington club.\"There's one thing I can tell you about this,\" Burr reportedly said in the recording. \"It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history. It's probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\"Every company should be cognizant of the fact that you may have to alter your travel,\" Burr continued. \"You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it could be done on video conference. Why risk it?\"\n\n\n\nOn Thurdsay night, Burr defended his decision to speak to the club in a lengthy Twitter thread and accused NPR \"journalistic malpractice.\" He did not address the ProPublica report, however.In a statement to ProPublica, a spokesperson for Burr said: \"Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak. As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-2",

A Spotify representative confirmed her departure.The news comes as the NBA has faced declining ratings and as live sports, the NBA in particular, feel the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. Lee's first priority will be helping the league recover and keep it relevant after commissioner Adam Silver suspended the 2019-2020 season indefinitely on March 11.Lee, who was formerly global VP of partner solutions at Spotify, will lead brand and advertising strategy for the organization's properties including the NBA, NBA 2K, and NBA G League.She is set to start on April 6 and report to NBA CMO Kate Jhaveri.\n\n\n\nWith all live games cancelled, the NBA is looking for ways to stay relevant to fansThe NBA was the first major sports league to be hit by COVID-19 when Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive on March 11. Silver immediately postponed all sched ued games until further notice.Since then, several more players have tested positive, including Christian Wood of the Detroit Pistons and former MVP Kevin Durant of the Brooklyn Nets.Silver told ESPN on Wednesday March 18 that games would not resume until the CDC dropped its restrictions on mass gatherings and floated the possibility of a charity game to keep fans engaged.Pro basketball remains a major draw for advertisers, though ratings have been decliningThe NBA, which was already facing challenges, created Lee's position well before the outbreak hit.Professional basketball remains one of broadcast television's most popular attractions, but combined ratings for games airing on the league's three key national platforms ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV declined nearly 15% in 2019 even as the NFL saw a resurgence.s\n\n\n\nSilver told The Washington Post that the NBA looked to replace some of that lost viewership with increased social media engagement, merchandising revenue, and promotion of the Turner Broadcasting-owned League Pass subscription service.Jhaveri said Lee's job was to expand efforts to connect more directly with fans worldwide.For now, the NBA must take an all-hands-on-deck mentality in tackling the coronavirus, because advertisers and sponsors had multi-million-dollar contracts riding on the now-stalled season.Lee was hired to manage how the NBA promotes itself and uses fans' dataAccording to the NBA, Lee will oversee the league's advertising and how it uses data to drive brand strategy.At Spotify, she led efforts to further monetize all content and facilitate brand partnerships as the streaming music company moved into podcasts. She previously held top positions at Vevo, AT, and Showtime.\n\n\n\nLee sits on the boards of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and Makers Women, a production company focused on gender equality projects. She also facilitated Spotify's 2020 sponsorship of See It Be It, a partnership with the Cannes Lions Festival to provide opportunities to young female creatives.Business Insider named Lee one of the most powerful women in mobile marketing for 2016, the year she joined Spotify.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17-26", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

The pandemic has not only slowed sales, it's also highlighted the downsides to working with international suppliers as an American startup. In January, the brand was expecting a major inventory shipment of new styles and restocked sizes from China before the Lunar New Year. The shipment was delayed until after the holiday break — then the coronavirus broke out across China and many factory employees didn't return to work.Nimble Made's inventory is still sitting on factory floors. Meanwhile, February sales decreased by 45% and three best-selling shirts are almost completely out of stock, or unavailable in popular sizes.The situation highlighted the downsides of working with an international supplier, like long lead time, lack of effective product quality control, and low visibility into the manufacturing process. \"We've been inspired to get a better handle on our supply-chain process and make it into a more sustainable one,\" Kang told Business Insider. \n\n\n\nTo tackle these roadblocks, Nimble Made is looking for a domestic supplier that can provide a more long-term relationship. But that can take a while. \"To build a brand-new supplier relationship takes an equal, if not longer, amount of time,\" Kang said.Though a simple Google search can lead you to the right suppliers (and you can email them your inquiry), Kang said most factories will want to speak on the phone to be able to cover the complexity and specificity of your product.Whether on the phone or in person, here's the exact format Kang uses to start a conversation with a supplier: First, he introduces himself: \"Hey, I'm Wesley and we sell dress shirts.\" He explains that Nimble Made is a startup: \"I only want to make 50 dress shirts per style because we're so new. Is that something you'd be willing to do?\"Then, he explains what he's looking for: \"The most important thing is the sizing because that's what we stand for.\"Next, he asks the factory representative for their minimum order quantity. \"That's going to dictate essentially how much money you have to put up to start a new relationship.\" He asks for the cost per unit (CPU) manufactured, which is primarily dependent on material.For international suppliers, he asks for the FOB pricing, or price per unit plus the transportation charges for shipping.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id":

As of Tuesday evening, confirmed cases at NASA included its Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\"[I]t is imperative that we take this pre-emptive step to thwart further spreading of the virus among the workforce and our communities,\" Bridenstine added.\n\n\n\nNASA's agency-wide move follows a phase called \"Stage 3\" from a recently unveiled \"Response Framework\" document, which it created to rapidly mitigate the spread of the coronavirus among workers, if necessary.Stage 1 applies to mostly functional access to centers and facilities, with an emphasis on social distancing, reduction in non-essential travel, and other activities to reduce the spread of the virus. The last phase, called Stage 4 — which only Ames is currently subject to, per a NASA coronavirus page — is a near-total closure of all facilities, \"except to protect life and critical infrastructure.\"\"This is the first time NASA has been in this situation,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.Coronavirus is confirmed to have infected about 200,000 people around the world and killed 8,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, and approximately half of all cases have not yet resolved. The overall mortality rate of the novel coronavirus is reported to be as high as 3.4% or, more recently, approximately 1.4%, according to STAT.However, many cases are still going undetected due to testing shortfalls and the fact that some people with COVID-19 show no obvious symptoms. Deaths are also weighted heavily toward those people who are older or have what appear to be underlying risk factors such as heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, or cancer, according to a March 11 study published The Lancet.\n\n\n\nNASA previously tightened access to its astronauts, including those slated to fly SpaceX's new Crew Dragon spaceship for the first time this spring — and return the US to flight since the retirement of the space shuttle program in July 2011. NASA is also working to develop the Space Launch System and Orion spaceship to send astronauts back to the moon mid-decade, and possibly on to Mars in the 2030s.Business Insider asked the NASA spokesperson which missions and projects would be affected by the agency-wide escalation in its response plan, but they did not immediately provide a response.", "categories": [{"confident": true,

As of Tuesday, South Korea has reported 8,320 cases and the US has 6,420.Whereas the number of US cases reported each day has been rising since March 5, the number of daily confirmed cases in South Korea peaked on February 29 and has been decreasing since.Two charts show the difference between the course of the two countries' epidemics so far.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nThe US and South Korea reported their first coronavirus cases on the same day.South Korea's total number of cases is higher than the US' — the former has more than 8,300 while the latter has at least 6,400 — but the trajectories of those cases day by day reveals two different realities. In South Korea, which instituted widespread testing, the number of new cases reported each day seems to be lower than the one prior — a sign the country has wrangled its outbreak. In the US, the number of new cases per day has increased steadily since March 5.Two charts of new confirmed cases over timeFor the month following South Korea's first confirmed case, the number of cases reported there remained low. Then the country saw a spike in late February, after a 61-year-old \"super-spreader\" infected many other members of a fringe religious group called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Between February 20 and 29, the number of new cases reported jumped each day, peaking February 29 with 909 new cases.Since then, South Korea's daily case counts have decreased. On Monday, the country saw only 74 new cases reported.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ruobing Su/Business Insider\n \n \n The US' epidemic curve started off looking similar to South Korea's. For the first month or so after the first confirmed case, the number of infected people remained low, with less than 15 cases.\n\n\n\nThen, on February 28 — the day after the US' first case of community spread — the number of cases started to rise each day, and that rise hasn't stopped. The US' epidemic growth curve looks like a steep stair case, with each day bringing a new record number of new confirmed cases.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ruobing Su/Business Insider\n \n \n The US' total number of confirmed cases is likely far lower than the reality because the country is still ramping up widespread testing. According to the COVID Tracking Project — a testing-tracking resource from two journalists at the Atlantic and the founder of a medical data startup — only 47,000 tests have been run in the US so far. (They note, however, that those figures may be incomplete due to different state policies on reporting negative tests.)South Korea, by contrast, can test tens of thousands of people per day for COVID-19. As of Monday, the country had tested 274,504 people. That allows them to quarantine infected people more immediately. South Korea's robust testing also likely means its confirmed case count is a ore accurate representation of the number of cases in the country than the US'. Read more:One chart explains why

Part of that means anticipating potential impacts on our business, and taking difficult but decisive steps now to get ahead of them.After several discussions, we have decided to pause net new hiring company-wide through May 31st, when we will re-evaluate and either stay the course or restart recruiting.\"According to LinkedIn, Uber had thousands of job listings worldwide at the time of writing.\n\n\n\nEmployees have been nervous for weeks that the company was gearing up for another big restructuring, including layoffs. In fact, someone asked Krishnamurthy about layoffs at the all-hands meeting on Tuesday — but she assured the troops that company had no plans for layoffs at this time, a spokesperson tells Business Insider.Still, the ride-hailing giant has gone through series of upper-management changes, including the exit of key engineering vice president Matthew Mengerink earlier this month. Recent months have seen the departure of top executives at its Uber Eats and New Mobility divisions.Demand for these apps has likely drastically decreased in the past few days as more states, counties and cities ask their residents to hunker down in place and limit travel thanks to the coronavirus. In some places, like Summit County, Colorado, rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft have been banned entirely. Uber Eats, in particularly, could be a service that sees usage spike as in-person dining has been restricted at a growing number of cities, but delivery remains available. However, Uber Eats this week followed its competitors and waived the delivery feefor more than 100,000 independent restaurants. Uber has also also agreed to give two weeks pay to drivers who test positive for COVID-19 or are quarantined.Are you an Uber insider with insight to share?

A new investigation from Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases attributes these cases to the virus' initial spread among food workers before the ship was quarantined on February 3.The researchers found that the virus was likely transmitted first to crew members from passengers who started showing symptoms on January 22 and 23. By February 3, the first crew member to test positive for the virus — a food-service worker — had developed a fever. Around 20 crew members tested positive by February 9. Fifteen of them were workers who prepared food for the rest of the crew. Most of them also lived on the ship's third deck, where a group of food-service workers lived.The crew mainly congregated in a shared dining area that was off-limits to passengers, the investigation found. There, the workers may have passed the virus to one another through their respiratory droplets, such as saliva or mucus. Even after the ship was quarantined on February 3, some crew members continued to work to maintain essential operations. The director of Japan's Disease Control and Prevention Center, Norio Ohmagari, later told CNN that crew members should have been isolated just like passengers. \n\n\n\n\"We suspected some of the cruise staff may have already been infected, but ... they had to operate the cruise ship itself, they had to see the passengers, they had to deliver the meals,\" Ohmagari added. \"So that may have caused some close contact with the cruise-ship workers and also the passengers.\"By February 18, crew members represented around 12% of those infected on board.

While researchers are studying the effectiveness of using chloroquine to treat the coronavirus, it's not yet proven to work.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nElon Musk has opened up about contracting malaria in 2000, saying he had a \"near fatal case\" of the disease. In several tweets on Monday night, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO described what happened when he contracted falciparum, a potentially fatal form of malaria that can affect the central nervous system or cause \"acute respiratory distress,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Musk said he thinks a drug that was used to treat his illness would be effective in treating the novel coronavirus. \"Had near fatal case of falciparum,\" Musk tweeted. \"Would've died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn't mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing.\"He went on to say he was misdiagnosed twice before doctors discovered he had malaria. \n\n\n\n—Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 16, 2020—Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 16, 2020Musk contracted the illness during a trip to Brazil and South Africa with his then wife Justine in December 2000, and it's one reason he famously no longer takes vacations.  \"That's my lesson for taking a vacation,\" Musk said in the book \"Elon Musk.\" \"Vacations will kill you.\"Testing existing drugsThe drug that Musk mentioned in his tweets, chloroquine, is typically used to treat malaria. But doctors have been testing its effectiveness in treating the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. Researchers in Barcelona have been giving the drug to people who have been in close contact with coronavirus patients because studies have suggested it could prevent the virus from reproducing. Doctors in China are testing the drug on patients with the disease, and immunologists at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation said they are testing chloroquine as well. The drug has some side effects, including stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and in some cases, itching. More severe side effects include cardiac failure caused by cardiomyopathy when patients are treated long-term in high doses, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. Patients have also experienced central nervous system disorders, muscular weakness, anemia, and vision and hearing degeneration, according to the FDA. \n\n\n\nMusk isn't a doctor, nor is he an expert on infectious diseases. While the drug is being tested and used to treat patients, there's currently no scientific proof of its effectiveness yet. Currently, there is no vaccine for coronavirus, though there are multiple vaccines undergoing clinical trials. As of Tuesday, 185,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus worldwide, and 7,300 people have died. In the US, there have been cases reported in almost every state, and at least 92 coronavirus deaths have been confirmed.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links":

The Fed's rate-setting committee says that it now plans to hold its rate at the new low level \"until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track.\"The changing Fed rate is likely to yield a benefit to consumers on loan and credit products. Because the Fed rate affects the cost of borrowing, changes can ripple through to consumer-facing products. For example, after the Fed's first emergency rate cut, mortgage rates hit their lowest level on record: The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.36% for the week of March 12, and the average rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 2.77%, per data from Freddie Mac cited by the Journal.In a similar vein, a decline in federal interest rates can also affect the APR on credit cards, which are decided based on a broad market rate plus a margin decided by each card company (which averaged 12.13 percentage points as of November 2019, per an analysis of Fed data by WalletHub.com cited by the Journal). The Fed rate change could affect the broader market rate, leading to lower APRs, provided card lenders don't choose to hike their margins. But a near-zero rate is likely to cause negative effects for banks when it comes to savings products, especially challenger banks that offer high-yield savings accounts. A slipping Fed rate will encourage more loan activity from banks and discourage them from offering high interest rates on savings accounts for the sake of profit margins. This will likely put the most pressure on banks that use high-yield savings accounts to generate new business to lower their rates.We've seen similar occurrences before: Ahead of anticipated cuts last August, Goldman Sachs' Marcus digital bank reduced its interest rate from 2.25% to 2.15%, and its rate has since slid even further, to 1.7%. The more that banks like Marcus have to reduce their rates, the less they'll be able to stand out from competitors and lure in customers with the promise of better return on their savings than they would see with incumbents.Want to read more stories like this one?

emergency rate cut was the Fed's second in two weeks, after it reduced its guidance by half a percentage point on March 3.", "For example, after the Fed's first emergency rate cut, mortgage rates hit their lowest level on record: The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.36% for the week of March 12, and the average rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 2.77%, per data from Freddie Mac cited by the Journal.In a similar vein, a decline in federal interest rates can also affect the APR on credit cards, which are decided based on a broad market rate plus a margin decided by each card company (which averaged 12.13 percentage points as of November 2019, per an analysis of Fed data by WalletHub.com cited by the Journal).", "A slipping Fed rate will encourage more loan

The popular music festival will now take place on the weekends of October 9-11 and October 16-18.The festival was originally scheduled to take place the weekends of April 10-12 and April 17-19.Though Coachella has more affordable packages, it is also known for its luxury. The most expensive on-site campsite at Coachella is Safari Campground, and it features luxury tent rates beginning around $10,000 for a four-night stay.Festival packages including lodging at circular Resort Yurts cost around $25,000, according to Money.Staying on the campgrounds gives festival-goers access to a private bar and spa, along with personal golf cart transportation to and from the stages.Visit BusinessInsider.com for more stories.Coachella has been postponed until October amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The popular music festival, which was set to take place the weekends of April 10-12 and April 17-19, will now happen the weekends of October 9-11 and October 16-18. Ticket prices are expected to stay the same, though it's not known whether the line-up will change.Though the festival offers more affordable packages, it is also known for its luxury. For some Coachella attendees, $429 tickets may well end up being one of the cheapest purchases of the long weekend.While many people opt for luxury hotels or mansion-sized Airbnbs, others choose to stay at the Safari Campground, the festival's most expensive on-site campground.Fancy camping is not a new concept: A luxury Chicago hotel offers a glamping package on the terrace of its penthouse suite, and there's a $700 glamping package on an island in New York City Harbor. The latter is a steal compared to Coachella's campsite, where prices are in the thousands.As Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower previously reported, total Coachella costs vary widely depending on attendee preferences. While it is possible to budget, the rich and famous who attend the infamous festival are usually more than willing to pay above-average costs. On the other end of the spectrum, there's also the more affordable but far less glamorous $102 car camping option.Prices for Safari Tents begin at $9,500 with the option to add up to two additional guests for a $2,500 fee per person. For Resort Yurts, prices vary depending on customization packages. Money previously estimated a yurt stay to cost $25,000 for the weekend, which also included catered meals and two artist passes to the festival shows.Keep reading for a complete look at the Coachella

We will not collect fees on these bookings,\" Airbnb CEO Brian tweeted. \"We don't want guests to feel like they have to travel because they cannot get their money back.\"  Airbnb bookings have taken a hit as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world, infecting more than 153,000 people. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nAirbnb is updating its cancellation policy to allow guests to cancel reservations anywhere in the world for a full refund in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the company announced Saturday. \"In response to the extraordinary events and global disruption to travel caused by COVID-19, today we are announcing updated coverage under Airbnb's Extenuating Circumstances policy,\" an Airbnb statement said. \"This policy now applies to existing reservations for stays and Airbnb Experiences made on or before March 14, 2020, with check-in dates between March 14, 2020 and April 14, 2020.\"Under the new policy, guests can claim a full refund without penalty — a policy implemented to avoid putting pressure on guests, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said.  \"First, Airbnb will allow guests around the world to cancel and get their money back. We will not collect fees on these bookings,\" Chesky tweeted. \"We don't want guests to feel like they have to travel because they cannot get their money back.\"  Until recently, the company resisted issuing refunds to its guests, largely leaving the decision up to its hosts. The company's refunds were only guaranteed to a select list of countries on a list.\n\n\n\nJust a day before, the company had updated its cancellation policy to apply to bookings made in the United States as well as Mainland China, South Korea, and Italy. But as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world, and infected more than 153,000 people, more countries have gone into lockdown. In his tweet, Chesky commended the Airbnb hosts have already independently been giving guests refunds, and added that the company would be thinking of ways to support Airbnb hosts whose incomes may take a hit amid the flurry of reservation cancellations. \"Second, our hosts have acted like heroes during this time. The majority of hosts have chosen to give their guests a partial or full refund at their cost,\" Chesky said. \"Third, we know our hosts depend on money from Airbnb. 50% depend on it to pay their rent/mortgage. We are working on some bold ideas to support hosts, and we will have news very soon.\" Airbnb bookings have already taken a hit as a slew of cancelled events because of the coronavirus pandemic have prompted people to delay or cancel travel plans. Airbnb's decision to issue refunds could further hit the company's revenue ahead of its IPO, especially if it also entails refunding its hosts.  Read more:Apple's unprecedented decision to close all stores outside of China because of coronavirus may be a sign of what's to comeThe US has reported 51 coronavirus deaths among more than 2,500 cases.

Brian Kemp's signature of an emergency declaration that unlocked sweeping powers to fight COVID-19. In a speech Saturday, the governor renewed a call for places of worship, schools and others to consider canceling large gatherings as cases in the state rise.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Louisiana became the first state to push back its presidential primaries from April 4 to June 20 over the threat of the novel coronavirus. As of Saturday, the virus had infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,600. Georgia is reporting 66 confirmed cases, with most concentrated around metro Atlanta. One death in the state has been attributed to the virus.Only one candidate is on the Republican ballot in Georgia for the presidential primary: President Donald Trump.The Democratic race has been narrowed to a two-man matchup between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Biden has been beating Sanders among key demographics at play in Georgia Democratic politics like African Americans and suburban voters and has been endorsed by a slew of state and local officials.\n\n\n\nRaffensperger's office said that the decision to postpone the election was made in consultation with the state Democratic and Republican Parties.Read more:Louisiana is postponing its April 4 presidential primary for over 2 months due to the coronavirus outbreakTikTok struggled to remove a deceptively edited clip of Joe Biden, revealing the uphill battle the platform has with content moderationCoronavirus could stop in-person campaigning in the 2020 US election.

Associates at top Manhattan law firms kept heading to the office.Firms like Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Dechert issued memos to update their associates on work policies in light of the coronavirus, but did not instruct them to work from home, according to internal communications seen by Business Insider.Faisa Saeed, Cravath's presiding partner, told staff in a memo on March 11 that if they were concerned about mass transit, they could discuss the \"feasibility\" of working remotely with their supervisor, but noted that the expectation was for the office to stay \"well-staffed.\"The next day, however, she encouraged attorneys who wanted to work remotely during the month of March to do so, before adding: \"The New York and London office will remain open and accessible to anyone wishing to work in the office.\" \"In the event that remote work becomes necessary, be sure you know your options,\" said a memo sent March 12 to all associates by Dechert's chair Andrew Levander and CEO Harry Nassau.\n\n\n\nThe communications illustrate the all-hands-on-deck work environment at the nation's top law firms, where associates toil around the clock for Fortune 500 clients to handle their most pressing problems.Life of an associate at a major law firm comes with a fat paycheck, with salaries ranging from $190,000 for the most junior, to $350,000 for senior associates with nine years experience.But the job can also mean demanding bosses who require their nearly 24/7 attention. Senior partners contacted by Business Insider about the current policies said that they weren't surprised and that it seemed normal, given the high-pressure demands that come with a career at a major law firm. To be sure, not all law firms are staying open, with Reed Smith telling employees to work from home, and Quinn Emanuel shutting down its New York office after one of its partners tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nOther firms, however, are not taking such measures, even as corporate clients implement work-from-home policies designed to reduce the chance of transmission.Among the corporations that have reportedly told employees to work from home are Amazon, Google, Chevron, and Apple. Big Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have told New York-based employees to start working from home in shifts. One other law firm whose New York office has stayed open was Wachtell Lipton, according to people familiar with the matter, though one insider said attorneys were told they could work from home so long as they could \"meet the demands of clients with the same standards of excellence.\"\"It's not unpatriotic,\" said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal firm policy. \"Companies are under serious distress.\"", "categories":

Jim Banks of Indiana was blocked on Twitter by a senior Chinese official who claimed the coronavirus pandemic was \"brought\" by the US military into Wuhan, China.\"I've been blocked by [Lijian Zhao], a [Communist Party of China] foreign minister in China's Dept of 'Information' who claims that the #Wuhan coronavirus originated in the US,\" Banks said on Twitter.\"China's 'information' official tells blatant lies, gets questioned, then immediately reverts to censorship. Too perfect,\" he added.On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao suggested without evidence that the US Army \"brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\"\"When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals,\" Zhao questioned on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\"Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" Zhao added in his tweet.Neither Banks nor Zhao previously tweeted to each other.\"I've never interacted with Lijian Zhao on Twitter,\" Banks said in a message to Insider. \"He's going out of his way to target politicians that are generally critical of China.\"\"The conspiracy theory he's peddling is extremely hostile behavior by a high-level communist official,\" he added. \"Does President Xi condone this behavior? The entire episode underlines the need for the United States to distance ourselves from China and its economy as quickly as possible.\"China is one of the leading countries that trades the most with the US, along with Canada and Mexico.\n\n\n\nCui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the US, was summoned to the US State Department on Friday, after Zhao's posted his tweets.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n \n\n \n Getty Images / Thomas Peter-Pool\n \n \n Officials from both countries levied allegations on the virus's origins in recent weeks, as the World Health Organization upgraded its classification to a pandemic. Republican Rep. Tom Cotton of Arkansas on Thursday said he was looking into holding China \"accountable\" for the coronavirus after saying earlier in February that he was not ruling out the possibility that it may have been developed in a Chinese \"superlaboratory.\"Both Banks and Cotton have been longtime China hawks and have suggested Beijing had not been as forthcoming about the number of infections to downplay the seriousness of the epidemic. Chinese officials have been accused of lowering the number of cases and tamping down on reports for months, before the virus's spread was formally acknowledged by the government.Chinese health authorities widely deduced that the coronavirus originated from a wildlife market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The officials, in addition to their US counterparts, have been sharing their data over their cases since, according to President Donald Trump.\"We all know where it came from,\" Trump said in a press conference on Friday afternoon, referring to a phone conversation he had with Chinese President Xi Jinping in February.\n\n\n\nNearly 120,000 people have been infected so far and over 4,290 people have died, the majority of cases stemming from China. The US has had over 1,629 cases and 41 deaths as of Friday afternoon, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2,

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1232736, "name": "Matt Weinberger"}, "body": "\"Pokémon Go\" is making some changes that make it easier for players who might be stuck indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic to catch 'em all.The in-game \"incense\" item, which attracts Pokémon to your location, will last for an hour — dovetailing with a general increase in the number of Pokémon you can find in the wild.Developer Niantic has also canceled its monthly Community Day event, which would have seen Pokémon trainers come out in droves on March 15th.It's a logical way to help discourage behaviors that could spread COVID-19, the coronavirus disease. But it's also a notable change for a game that's always positioned itself as a game about exploring the world around you.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nFor the first time since it launched in July 2016, \"Pokémon Go\" is making some big — though temporary — changes that actually cut down on the amount of walking that players have to do in the quest to catch 'em all.It's part of developer Niantic's response to the ongoing spread of COVID-19, the coronavirus disease. With health authorities around the world recommending practices like social distancing and self-quarantining as key to stemming the spread of the virus, it's easy to see why Niantic might want to encourage \"Pokémon Go\" players to stay home. A blog post lays out the specifics:Niantic is cancelling the next iteration of its monthly Community Day event, which was slated to be held on March 15th and offer players a higher chance to catch a rare, \"shiny\" iteration of Abra, one of the titular pocket monsters.\"Pokémon Go\" players will be able to buy a one-time bundle of 30 in-game incense items for one Pokécoin, the game's unit of currency — a steep discount from its normal price. Plus, it'll work for an hour, up from half an hour normally. Incense summons Pokémon to spawn all around the user, meaning you don't have to walk. More Pokémon will spawn in the wild, again meaning that players have to do less walking to find monsters.Pokéstops, the real-world points of interest that give players useful in-game items, will give players gifts more frequently. Players can give these gifts to each other, and opening them grants even more items, as well as Pokémon eggs that can hatch by walking.The blog post says these changes are \"effective starting now until further notice.\"\n\n\n\nIt's no surprise that Niantic would take this step: \"Pokémon Go\" players often find themselves in parks, museums, and shopping malls in search of rare monsters and useful items. That's especially true of the monthly Community Day events, where players team up to hunt that month's featured Pokémon and fight in 20-player raid battles against powerful bosses. Those kinds of behaviors aren't necessarily compatible with controlling the spread of coronavirus.Niantic also previously postponed a big \"Safari Zone\" event slated to be held in St. Louis later in March.Still, Niantic has long said that \"Pokémon Go\" is first and foremost a game meant to encourage people to get out, get exercise, and explore their neighborhoods.Even a recently-added battle league mode, which lets Pokémon trainers battle each other and boost their rank for rewards, requires players to walk 3 kilometers for the right to battle five times. In that light, it's notable that \"Pokémon Go\" would get changes designed to help people stuck in place, however temporary they might prove to be.And while \"Pokémon Go\" may not be the phenomenon it once was, it still has a dedicated fan base: A recent analyst estimate pegged the game at generating $900 million in revenue from in-game purchases alone in 2019.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB17", "level":

The ship's captain wasn't proactive enough in taking steps to protect passengers and crew members, Klein said, leaning instead on the Japanese government, which imposed a quarantine over three days after learning that a prior passenger on the ship had tested positive for the coronavirus.\"He had the ability to segregate crew members who may have been ill from those who weren't ill or to find ways of ensuring that crew members who potentially were ill were not eating at the same crew mess as the people who weren't ill,\" Klein said of the ship's captain.Princess Cruises did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Being more decisive may not have stopped the coronavirus from spreading on the ship, but it could have at least slowed it down, Klein said. While Princess Cruises, which is owned by Carnival Corp., mishandled the Diamond Princess, Klein said the cruise line did make a smart decision by canceling all of its cruises until May 11.\n\n\n\n\"I think that was a very wise move,\" he said. \"I think it's unfortunate that it took them this long and that the remainder of the companies within Carnival and others haven't seen the value in taking that kind of an approach.\"Ultimately, Princess Cruises isn't likely to suffer long-term reputational damage from its handling of the coronavirus, Klein said, pointing to Holland America Line, which recovered after multiple norovirus outbreaks in 2002.\"Within a year, people pretty much forgot,\" he said.Do you work for Princess Cruises or another Carnival Corp. cruise line?

Disney World and Disneyland Paris remained open at the time of this writing. Ahead of the US Disneyland's closure, Wall Street analysts began to estimate how much the coronavirus outbreak could damage Disney's business.Analysts at UBS estimated on March 10 that closing both of Disney's US theme parks, Disney World and Disneyland, for 30 days could cost the company $1.5 billion in revenue in 2020, and $803 million in operating income.\n\n\n\nThe firm used prior US park closures, including when Disney World was closed for two days in 2017 because Hurricane Irma, as a guide.\"With profitability for US parks being much higher [than those in Asia], we looked at the impact of prior hurricane-related closures for Disney World to assess the impact,\" the note said.If Disney were forced to shut down all of its theme parks globally for 30 days, UBS estimated Disney could take a nearly $2 billion revenue hit, or about 2.5% of what the analyst firm forecasted Disney would generate in 2020 overall.Separately, Rosenblatt Securities estimated on Feb. 26 that closing Disney World and Disneyland could risk roughly $50 million in combined segment operating income, or around $0.025 per share, per day.That firm used 2017's Hurricane Irma, when Disney World parks were shut down for two days and Disney Cruise Line trips were canceled or shortened, as a guide, as well. Disney took a $100 million hit to operating income during Hurrican Irma, and Rosenblatt estimated about $70% of that was due to Disney World. It estimated the rest came from the cruise business.\n\n\n\nUBS estimated Disney was the media company most threatened by the coronavirus, because of its large parks business.In 2019, Disney's parks, experiences, and products business generated $26.2 billion in revenue, which was roughly 38% of its business that year. The company did not break out how much revenue came from theme parks alone. Disney said on March 12 that its Disneyland resort would remain open through March 16 to give people time to make travel plans. The Downtown Disney district that includes shops, restaurants, and other entertainment would remain open.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-25", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Son didn't specify where, but the response of his Twitter followers suggests he intends rollout for his home turf of Japan.\n\n\n\n\"To those who are worried about the corona virus, I would like to provide a simple PCR test opportunity for free. Starting with 1 million people. We are now preparing ways to apply and so on #coronatestfriends,\" Son said. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction testing) test typically means a swab.—孫正義 (@masason) March 11, 2020In another tweet, Son posted a diagram of how the test might work.—孫正義 (@masason) March 11, 2020 Son also pointed to fellow billionaire Bill Gates, whose philanthropic organization is funding at-home coronavirus test kits in Washington state.According to John Hopkins University, there are 119,500 global confirmed cases of coronavirus, although the majority of these (80,900) are in mainland China where the virus originated. Japan has reported 581 confirmed cases and 12 deaths.Son breaks his Twitter hiatus as SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate and a major global tech investor, feels the shockwaves of the coronavirus outbreak. SoftBank, mostly through its Vision Fund, has invested huge amounts in massive consumer tech companies including Uber, DoorDash, and WeWork, all of which are expected to be impacted by the outbreak.\n\n\n\nUber has announced it will compensate any drivers put under quarantine, and gig-economy workers have expressed their concerns about staying healthy during the outbreak, cutting down hours and scouring their vehicles with disinfectant. Uber's ride-hailing arm may also take a hit as people choose to travel less to avoid infection.Food-delivery apps like Doordash and Uber Eats are likely to see a surge in demand, as has already happened in China. WeWork, on the other hand, may have to reckon with increased numbers of people working from home and a slowdown in new signings.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-20", "level": 2,

Today there are 647, according to the CDC.The play's writer told Insider that Trump \"loved\" the idea of the play and joked that he should play the role of ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nWhile the US was in the relatively early stages of the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump controversially held a 45-minute meeting — originally scheduled to be just 15 minutes — with the lead actors and creators of a play about ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page's anti-Trump texts.The play, \"FBI Lovebirds,\" was staged at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 27, the same day as the meeting in the Oval Office. At the time, there were 60 confirmed cases in the U.S. of novel coronavirus. The most recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) count is 647 nationwide. In photos exclusively obtained by Insider, Trump can be seen posing with former \"Lois and Clark\" actor Dean Cain, who played Strzok, and former \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" actress Kristy Swanson, who played Page.Strzok and Page were having an affair during the period of the texts, which Trump and his allies have cited as evidence of a \"Deep State\" conspiracy against him.\n\n\n\nAmong the most controversial of the messages was Strzok saying \"No, we'll stop it\" in response to Page's question asking whether Trump could actually be elected president. (Strzok later said the remark was \"off the cuff\" and in response to Trump's critical comments directed at Gold Star parents.)After the texts were made public in December 2017, Strzok and Page were removed from their posts as part of then-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Strzok was later fired by the FBI, and Page resigned in May 2018. Trump also posed in the Oval Office with the play's writer, Phelim McAleer, and his wife and producing partner, Ann McElhinney.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"FBI Lovebirds\" creators Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on February 27, 2020.\n \n\n \n Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead\n \n \n Trump spoke at CPAC on February 29, but he did not attend the play's performance two days earlier, and still hasn't seen it. McAleer told Insider that Trump \"loved\" the idea of the play and joked that he should play the role of Strzok. Cain replied in the Oval Office meeting that Trump could be his understudy. \n\n\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Read more:Current and former Trump

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1996552, "name": "Thomas Pallini"}, "body": "British Airways is canceling 24 flights between New York and London in response to reduced demand from the spread of coronavirus in Europe. The New York-London route is British Airways' flagship with numerous frequencies on some of its largest aircraft.British Airways primarily appeals to business travelers on the route through the use of premium-dense aircraft that earned the airline over $1 billion between 2018 and 2019. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nBritish Airways will be canceling 24 flights between New York and London in March as coronavirus continues to weaken demand for international travel. The announcement came on Monday as the UK flag carrier slashed flights on routes across its short-haul network in addition to previously announced route suspensions and reductions to Italy, South Korea, and Singapore.Scheduled flights between March 17 and March 28 will be affected, a time period in which over 200 British Airways flights were scheduled to fly between the two economic hubs. While the 24 flights are a relatively small dent in the daily flight volume for the route, they signify a reduced demand for international business travel.The London-New York route is the most lucrative in the world and British Airways is the dominant airline flying it, servicing the route with multiple frequencies per day and some of its largest aircraft including the Boeing 747 and 777 aimed at attracting business travelers.The route is most frequently flown by aircraft with premium-dense configurations where first and business class cabins favored by business travelers take up more sections of the aircraft than economy. Its strategy of appealing towards the business travel class earned the airline nearly $1.2 billion in revenue between April 2018 and March 2019, according to estimates from travel data analyzer OAG.Despite competing against Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines on the route, British Airways consistently offers the greatest number of flights, with near hourly service in the evening and a rare morning flight between the US and UK. Flexibility and a greater number of available premium seats than its competitors make the carrier an ideal choice for the business traveler that requires both. \n\n\n\nThe only route that's affected is the airline's flagship between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Heathrow Airport, the largest airports in their respective cities. British Airways also operates flights from JFK Airport to London's Gatwick and City Airports, as well as flights between Newark Airport and Heathrow, but both of these secondary routes have been affected yet. No other British Airways routes between the UK and the US have been reduced and the airline did not give Business Insider any additional details beyond the number of cancellations and the date range for the reduction in service. British Airways is the first European carrier to cancel flights on a route to the US, but not the first global carrier — Singapore Airlines reduced frequencies on its routes to the US, similarly aimed at business travelers, due to COVID-19 coronavirus. The airline also announced a temporary policy where customers booking flights between March 3 and March 16 will have the option to change their flights with no change fee in an attempt to inspire confidence in travel.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-7", "level": 2, "links":

Bernie Sanders with the jersey.But Brooks told fans in Detroit that he was wearing the jersey because he loved Barry Sanders, and said they both went to Oklahoma State University.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nCountry music icon Garth Brooks wore a Barry Sanders Lions jersey to a Detroit concert over the weekend, and the move confused Trump fans who thought he was supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders.Brooks shared a photo of himself in the jersey on Instagram, where supporters of President Donald Trump accused the country star of making things \"political.\"In reality, Brooks was just supporting his favorite Lions icon — former running back and NFL Hall of Famer Barry Sanders — with the jersey.According to MLive, the Detroit crowd at Ford Field on February 22 started changing \"Barry! Barry! Barry!\" as Brooks walked on stage, in the same way fans did when Sanders took the field during his decade-long career with the Lions.\"You guys got the greatest player in NFL history in my opinion in this jersey. I love this man,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"And I can vouch for him first-hand from way back when he just came out of Kansas and got to Oklahoma State. He's also one of the greatest human beings that you'll ever get to witness and be with. He's a good cat.

I thought you were a true American that loves Our Country?\"\"Love you. Hate the shirt,\" another fan wrote.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Brooks hit headlines when it was reported that he had turned down Trump's invite to perform at his inauguration ceremony.He later clarified reports, saying he never agreed to perform because he needed to solidify his tour schedule.\"We can't thank the Obamas enough for serving this country,\" he said at the time. \"And may God hold

Thus, there will be no show — an outcome the organizers said will have \"significant\" financial consequences for those involved in the event, which \"will need to be assessed over the coming weeks.\"The announcement said construction of the stands was almost complete, and that a week ago, there was \"nothing to suggest that such a measure was necessary.\"\"We regret this situation, but the health of all participants is our and our exhibitors' top priority,\" Maurice Turrettini, Chairman of the Geneva International Motor Show Foundation Board, said in a statement, thanking those involved in the organization of the show. \n\n\n\nTickets will be refunded, the announcement said, and event organizers will communicate about the refunds on their website \"as soon as possible.\" The fate of the Geneva International Motor Show, which was scheduled to begin media events on Monday and open to the public on March 5, has been iffy for days leading up to now. \"Geneva International Motor Show to go ahead despite coronavirus,\" a headline from February 19 reads. About a week later: \"Geneva Motor Show organizers urge coronavirus checks.\" And on Thursday: \"Geneva show attendance dwindles as virus woes spread.\"Then came the official cancellation on Friday. Everything from commuter cars and startup projects to hardcore supercars were scheduled to debut at Geneva, with names like the 1,250-horsepower Czinger 21C, the Pagani Imola, the Mercedes G-Wagen-based Brabus 800 Adventure XLP, the Hyundai Prophecy electric-vehicle concept, and only the second two-seat Bentley since 1930, the Bentley Mulliner Bacalar, all on the list. Some automakers are going ahead with their planned debuts, with Morgan Motor Company announcing that the launch of its new model \"will continue as scheduled\" with \"a revised format.\" Considering the size and scope of the show and its planned launches, other automakers are likely to do the same. \n\n\n\n\"This is a case of force majeure and a tremendous loss for the manufacturers who have invested massively in their presence in Geneva,\" Turrettini said. \"However, we are convinced that they will understand this decision.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB2", "level": 1, "links":

They said everything had been arranged and it was non-negotiable. So we felt like we had no choice but to proceed with the wedding.\"\n\n\n\nThe couple hosted a reception for their guests in the hotel's banquet hall, and delivered speeches and popped champagne over video from their suite in the same building.Mr. Yew said some of their guests were \"shocked\" when they learned of their plans, but added: \"I think if we had been there, the atmosphere would be different. People would have been wary.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The hotel in Singapore where coronavirus is believed to have spread.\n \n \n \n ROSLAN RAHMAN / Contributor / Getty Images\n \n \n\"My parents were not [happy about it] at first but they eventually agreed.\"Ms. Kang's parents were unable to attend the wedding due to travel restrictions imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus, which has killed 563 people in China.\n\n\n\nMr. Yew said he and his wife were \"not sad but a bit disappointed\" to have missed their own wedding.\"I think there were no other options, so no regrets,\" he added.The couple had officially tied the knot in China in October but planned a second ceremony in Singapore for friends and family who had been unable to make the first.There have been 28 confirmed coronavirus cases — none of them fatal — in Singapore, more than any country other than China and Japan. The patients include a six-month-old baby whose parents were also infected.The World Health Organization said on Thursday it had opened an investigation into three infections linked to an international business meeting in Singapore last month.\n\n\n\nCases in Malaysia and South Korea have been linked to the meeting of staff from an as-yet-unnamed multinational sales firm. One of the 100 people in attendance was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated.Read more:The Wuhan coronavirus has spread to 26 countries.

A paper from Imperial College London published on January 17 suggested that the figures were too low by a factor of 35.As part of their model, the Hong Kong academics predicted that the scale of the virus would double every 6.4 days.

It was widely believed that humans caught the virus from animals such as bats and snakes in a wet market in Wuhan, where meat is sold alongside live animals, often in poorly regulated conditions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dog meat stalls in Dongkou, China's biggest wet market, June 21, 2014.\n \n \n \n David Wong/South China Morning Post/Getty\n \n \nHowever a new report conducted by a large group of Chinese scientists and published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday challenges this theory. The research found that the virus could have originated elsewhere before entering the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market. Looking in detail at the cases of 41 patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus, scientists found that the first reported case of the virus from 1 December had no link to the wet market, according to Science, which cited The Lancet's report. The report also found that 13 of the 41 cases studied had no link to the marketplace. \"That's a big number, 13 with no link,\" Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Georgetown told Science.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Health care members make first aid to people as they cover their faces with sanitary masks after the first cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Hong Kong in Hong Kong.\n \n \n \n Miguel Candela/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n \n \nLucey said it is possible the first cases may have occurred back in November, and could have spread without detection among people before the virus was detected in the first group of cases from the wet market, according to Science. It is still not clear whether the virus came from the market or not, but the latest research says there is a possibility that it did not. One way to establish for certainty whether the virus originated from the market would be to take samples from the animals in the market — but the market has now been cleared and disinfected, according to The Conversation. The Wuhan Health Authority closed down the market on January 1, and banned the trade of live animals at wet markets last Wednesday.The virus has since spread to 12 countries including the US, Australia, Japan and Thailand. Read more:These are all the companies who have shut down operations in China over the deadly Wuhan coronavirus outbreakWuhan, China, faces such a shortage of coronavirus test-kits that people say getting one is like 'winning the lottery'A Chinese official warned of a shortage of protective masks and suits amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreakThe Wuhan coronavirus has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700.

Some accused the makeup mogul of trying to make the situation about himself.Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.Jeffree Star posted an Instagram story of the weather conditions where he lives in Hidden Hills, Los Angeles, just a few hours before the news broke of the helicopter crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven other passengers.Star, who recently moved to the massive 25,000-square-foot home, posted a video on Sunday morning of his Pomeranian Da Vinci outside in the fog.\"It is so foggy out,\" Star said. \"I literally can't see anything. Looks like I'm living in a cloud.\"The fog conditions had been so bad that even the Los Angeles Police Department had deemed it too dangerous to fly, Business Insider's Alex Ma reported.About two hours later, news broke of the tragic accident, and Star posted another Instagram story saying the crash had happened just \"two miles\" from his house.\"Oh my God, there goes another helicopter,\" he said in the now-deleted video. \"I can't f---ing believe this, you guys ... Kobe Bryant passed away two miles from my house. There's been helicopters flying over all morning, I feel sick.\"Star then sent thoughts to the rest of Bryant's family and expressed his fear about \"so much f---ed up s--- happening in the world,\" including the coronavirus outbreak.\"I'm in a state of shock,\" he said. \"Rest in peace to a f---ing legend. Kobe, we love you.\"—Rock Mercury (@RockinMercury) January 27, 2020However, some online commentators called Star out for posting a video so soon after the news, and claimed he was trying to make the situation about himself.\"Didn't think i could dislike him anymore and yet here we are,\" tweeted YouTuber Angelika Oles. \"Disgusting. I don't see a single tear and the fact that he made it all about himself makes me sick.\"Some took it as an opportunity to bring up Star's controversial past of using racial slurs, which he has since apologized for.Others stood up for Star though, and said his words were being taken out of context.\"Here's the rest of the Vid since you love being a dusty Hater!\" tweeted one fan. \"LEAVE

During that time, an asymptomatic person is also infectious and could spread the coronavirus to others, Ma said, which makes it difficult to stop its spread.Coronavirus symptoms include nasal congestion, headache, cough, sore throat, and a fever, according to infectious disease expert and University of California San Francisco professor Charles Chiu.\"At present, the rate of development of the epidemic is accelerating,\" Ma said at the press conference. \"I am afraid that it will continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.\"The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has killed 56 people and infected more than 2,000, Reuters reported on Sunday.Although officials have quarantined Wuhan and some other neighboring cities, the virus has spread to at least 12 other countries: Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France, Australia, Malaysia, Canada, and the US. Currently, there are no tests designed to detect this exact coronavirus strain, since 'coronavirus' refers to a family of viruses that cause common colds, Chiu said, and current coronavirus tests that doctors use can't detect the Wuhan coronavirus strain.Someone who gets a coronavirus could have minor symptoms and develop a flu or develop a more severe or life-threatening condition like pneumonia.Others viruses are infectious before symptoms appearThe Wuhan coronavirus isn't the only viral infection that is infectious before a person shows symptoms.According to the National Health Service in the UK, chickenpox, the common cold, and the flu are all infectious multiple days before a person with the virus shows any symptoms, like a rash in the case of chickenpox or a fever for the flu.Most people with infectious viruses can become non-infectious 24 hours after they start a course of antibiotics, according to NHS.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-15", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

Australia, Malaysia, Canada, and the US.", "Currently, there are no tests designed to detect this exact coronavirus strain, since 'coronavirus' refers to a family of viruses that cause common colds, Chiu said, and current coronavirus tests that doctors use can't detect the Wuhan coronavirus strain.Someone who gets a coronavirus could have minor symptoms and develop a flu or develop a more severe or life-threatening condition like pneumonia.Others viruses are infectious before symptoms appearThe Wuhan coronavirus isn't the only viral infection that is infectious before a person shows symptoms.According to the National Health Service in the UK, chickenpox, the common cold, and the flu are all infectious multiple days before a person with the virus shows any symptoms, like a rash in the case of chickenpox or a fever for the flu.Most people with infectious viruses can become non-infectious 24 hours after they start a course of antibiotics, according to NHS."]}, "title": "The

China Global Television Network reports that Liang Wudong, 62, was an ENT specialist \"at the front line\" of the outbreak.The Wuhan coronavirus has killed 41 people so far and infected nearly 1,300, causing the Chinese government to quarantine at least 12 cities, and at least 33 million people. The virus is believed to have originated at a wet market, where livestock and poultry are sold alongside animals like dogs, hares, and civets. Doctors in Wuhan have been overwhelmed with the number of coronavirus patients, and some are wearing adult diapers because they don't have time to go to the restroom. Wudong worked at Hubei Xinhau Hospital, which says he retired in March 2019.

He said that it showed a domestic flight out of Wuhan and that the clip had been circulating on Chinese social media.Business Insider has not independently verified the video.—David Paulk 波大卫 (@davidpaulk) January 20, 2020The state-funded Beijing News also posted a similar clip from January 12, showing at least three medics scanning the temperatures of passengers on Air China Flight CA119, from Wuhan to Macau, before taking off.The woman who sent the video, surnamed Cheng, said that the medics scanned passengers' temperatures for more than 10 minutes that the plane was not allowed to take off until everyone was cleared.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A man leaving a medical center in Wuhan, China, where at least three people died after contracting a new and little-understood respiratory virus.\n \n \n Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images\n \n \nThe Wuhan virus has pneumonia-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and chest pains, but little else is known about it.It has been identified as a strain of coronavirus — infecting the nose, throat, or sinuses — and likened to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which infected large parts of Asia in 2003.As of Monday, at least three people in Wuhan had died from the illness, local health authorities said. Nearly 200 other people in the city, ranging from 25 to 89 years old, had been infected, with 35 in \"severe\" condition and nine \"critically ill,\" the authorities said.Scientists at Imperial College London warned last week that the true number of infections could be over 1,700.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was sealed off after being

well as in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.The outbreak could become even deadlier as millions of people in China travel back to their hometowns to celebrate Lunar New Year on Saturday.The US Centers for Disease Control in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York said they would also start screening passengers coming from China for signs of the infection.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":

These layoffs haven't previously been reported.\nElizabeth Cooksey, a former top executive at online fashion company ModCloth who joined Caliva as the company's head of retail in March of last year, was among those cut, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.\nA company spokesperson said the ongoing fallout from retail closures due to the coronavirus pandemic had hurt sales, despite cannabis being deemed an \"essential business\" in California. The spokesperson confirmed that Cooksey was let go. Cooksey didn't respond to a message sent on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\n\n\"The Bay Area was the first region to enter into a 'Shelter-in-Place' on March 17th,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Like every other company that has retail, we anticipated and have since seen a dramatic drop in retail traffic at Caliva facilities due to social distancing measures, and had to make difficult decisions about where to increase and decrease our resources.\"\nTwo Caliva employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, including a security guard at Caliva's San Jose location on Wednesday and an employee at the corporate office in March, The San Jose Mercury News reported. \nBusiness Insider reported in February that Caliva cut ties with Eaze, another Bay Area cannabis startup, as the company pivoted to delivering cannabis directly to consumers, as well as operating its own cultivation facilities, dispensaries, and brands.\nEaze, previously a delivery-only startup that handled Caliva's deliveries, transitioned to owning and operating its own dispensaries.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of that shift, Caliva cut 200 workers, mostly full- and part-time drivers who delivered cannabis orders placed via Eaze, Caliva CEO Dennis O'Malley told Business Insider at the time.\nThe spokesperson touted Caliva's shift to curbside pickup and contactless cannabis delivery. The company in April partnered with Hypur to offer digital payments to customers.\n\"We were previously committed to doubling down on our in-house direct-to-consumer channels before the COVID-19 outbreak began, as reported by BI with us ending our contract with Eaze, which allowed us to quickly pivot our strategies to best and most safely service our customers and associates during this tumultuous time,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson added that Caliva has made 86 hires since March 30, and opened a new delivery hub in Culver City, California. \n\n\n\n\nCaliva closed a $75 million funding round in January of 2019 with participation from Carol Bartz, a tech investor who was CEO of Yahoo, and Joe Montana, the three-time Super Bowl MVP. \nThe company also touts rapper and entertainment mogul Jay-Z as its chief strategist, in charge of driving the brand's \"creative direction,\" Business Insider reported.\nRob Price contributed reporting.", "categories": [{"confident":

This occurs because the P/E ratio of the SP 500 expands to offset weak EPS,\" according to Stifel.\n\nStifel addressed the risks associated with coronavirus, saying the COVID-19 \"Fear Bubble\" has burst.\n\n\"Deaths in the US attributed to the disease peaked this season in April 2020 and we see close to zero COVID-19 attributed US deaths by the end of June 2020,\" said Stifel.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the firm said that the media and political reaction to COVID-19 is difficult to forecast and can have unpredictable economic effects.\n\nRead more: David Herro was the world's best international stock picker for a decade straight.

It was introduced in 2015 as a one-day-only sale that boasted more deals than Black Friday, and also celebrated Amazon's 20th anniversary as a company.\nThough the first Prime Day was met with some disappointment, subsequent Prime Days have improved in both the quality and quantity of deals, and the event has been made available to more countries outside the US every year. \nToday, it is a global shopping event where Prime members can shop more than 1 million deals sitewide, with new deals starting as often as every five minutes. \nAmazon hasn't officially announced the dates of this year's Prime Day, but reports say it will be in September.\nPreviously, Prime Day events have been held in mid-July. Prime Day 2020 was pushed back as Amazon contended with high order volume due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. \nLast year's Prime Day lasted 48 hours, starting at 12 a.m. PT on July 15 and ending at 11:59 p.m. PT on July 16. We think Prime Day 2020 may last even longer since the event has gotten bigger and bigger each year. \nDeals will be hosted on this Amazon page on Prime Day.\nYou need to be an Amazon Prime member in order to shop the deals, so if you aren't already, you should sign up for a free 30-day trial.\nWe won't be able to tell you until Prime Day gets a little closer, but if you want an idea of what to expect this year, below are some of the best deals from Prime Day last year. \nOnce Prime Day is officially here, we'll be live-updating this article of the best deals to shop. \nIn addition to the products above, Business Insider readers loved deals on the Lifestraw Personal Water Filter, 23andMe DNA Test, and Dash Rapid Egg Cooker. Here's a list of the most popular items readers bought during Prime Day.\nHold off on buying Amazon devices and services until September, if you can. \nAmazon always offers great deals on devices including Echo smart speakers, Kindle e-readers, Fire TV devices and tablets, and Ring cameras.\nPrime Day is often when Amazon offers all-time low prices on these popular tech products. In addition, services and memberships will be very cheap, or even free. Last year, Prime members got four months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1 and three months of Kindle Unlimited for free. \n \nDon't limit yourself to shopping on Amazon. \nThe emergence and dominance of Prime Day have inspired other major retailers like Walmart, Target, and eBay to put on their own sitewide sales. While they never say they're specifically competing against Amazon, their deals are meant to be just as competitive as Amazon's. \nWe have not yet received news that competing retailers will hold their own sales, now that the Prime Day date has been pushed back. We'll update you here once we know more. \nIn addition to the best Prime Day deals on Amazon, we'll also be showing you the best sales happening at the same time around the internet. \n \nDownload the free Amazon app (iOS, Android) before Prime Day starts. \nYou'll get phone notifications when a deal is starting. Go to \"Today's Deals\" in the app and click \"Upcoming\" to view all deals 24 hours before they go live. Then tap \"Watch this Deal\" and wait to shop.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB22-4", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB22-4",

potential cases of contracting the coronavirus while working.\nNYSE had first physically opened its trading floor on April 22, 1903.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a two-month precautionary closure, the New York Stock Exchange is ready to reopen its renowned trading floor on Tuesday.\nThe exchange operated without its trading floor for the first time in its 228-year history from March 23 as the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed New York City, making it an epicenter for the virus.\nThe NYSE has shut down operations before, but the trading floor has always operated when the exchange has been open, until this year.\nSince closing down two months ago, the exchange had been limited to all-electronic trading, according to NYSE President Stacey Cunningham's op-ed on the Wall Street Journal. \n\n\n\n\nCompared to the iconic images of traders seen on the NYSE trading floor, the exchange will now look and feel different as only one-quarter of the workforce returns to their jobs, the Wall Street Journal reported. \nRead More: Jefferies breaks down the top 22 stocks it thinks you should buy right now — including 6 fast-risers

temperature checks, and avoid physical contact. \nOther measures include a ban on bringing visitors to the floor and meals will only allowed at designated spots in the NYSE's cafeteria.\n\n\n\n\nTraders will also be subject to signing a liability waiver that prohibits them from suing the exchange in case of contracting the virus.\nAccording to a copy of the waiver seen by the Journal, traders must acknowledge that returning to work could result in \"contracting Covid-19, respiratory failure, death, and transmitting Covid-19 to family or household members and others who may also suffer these effects.\"\nNYSE did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Markets Insider outside business hours.\nRead More: The beginner's guide to investing in wine, from

The Vancouver-based fashion tech company received funding from Struck Capital, who led the round, with participation from 500 Startups, Revel Partners, M3 Ventures. \n\"We were going to keep the platform in beta for a few more months, but then Covid came along,\" Blackcart founder and CEO Donny Ouyang told Business Insider in an interview. \"We messaged all potential investors to fast-track the fundraising process to launch, it was five weeks of back and forth, 100s of emails and five or six meetings every day.\" \nOuyang admitted that the process of fundraising and onboarding new staff remotely was \"strange,\" Blackcart is actively hiring ahead of fully launching its platform in the coming days.\n\n\n\n\nThe issue is simple, in order to help shoppers find the right item most retailers make returns free so that customers can find the right item. However, the process of mass returns is inefficient and hits the margins of retailers, particularly smaller merchants. Try-before-you-buy is one solution to that issue, but security is paramount.\nTo that end, Ouyang hired a scammer to attack the company's fraud detection systems to look for weaknesses or potential issues. As a result, Blackcart will \"have the best card protection model on the market,\" according to Ouyang. \n\"There is a trend away from bricks and mortar retailers because of the inefficiencies and the cost of rent for shops, Blackcart is part of this macro trend,\" Adam Struck, partner at Struck Capital. \"It's hard to do a completely remote fundraising process with our superpower of picking up in-person cues removed, so we did an incredible amount of Zoom calls to work on this opportunity.\"\nBlackCart's plugin will be available to all merchants including Shopify stores later this month. The company has powered tens of thousands of transactions while in beta — dramatically increasing retailers' online sales, according to Ouyang. Currently Blackcart has 40 merchants signed up and wants 50 by the time of launch. \n\n\n\n\n\"Covid is changing try before you buy because everyone is online now whereas previously it was only 30% of sales,\" Ouyang said. \"Our overall vision is that in the future people will only do try-before-you-buy and Covid will accelerate that.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB18-5",

The environmentalist's visit to the facility was sparked by a complaint that Nike was not cleaning properly or allowing workers to practice social distancing, according to the report. The environmentalist was told she could not enter the facility without an appointment. \nAccording to ProPublica, the environmentalist received a call the following day from a Nike employee who said the company had installed markers at the facility to enforce social distancing and that the facility was closed each Tuesday for cleaning.  \n\n\n\n\nNo one from the Shelby County office visited the warehouse again to verify that the changes had been made, and the environmentalist who had been denied entry on April 16 \"felt at that time there was nothing else that needed to be done,\" Kasia Alexander, environmental health administrator for the department, told ProPublica.\nBruce Randolph, the Shelby County health director told the outlet that the agency has the authority to use local police to gain access to a facility, though it did not do so. From March 26 to May 12, the agency received 201 complaints among various businesses in the county. The Nike facility was the only facility that had turned a county inspector away, according to the report.\n\"We don't just automatically get law enforcement involved simply because the first time we show up, some security and management person refuses to allow us access,\" he said.\nA Nike spokesperson told the outlet the company had expanded social distancing in doorways, breakrooms, on the warehouse floor, and other areas from 3 feet to 6 feet at the beginning of April. The company said it uses plexiglass to separate workstations and placed markings on tables to tell workers where to sit to maintain an appropriate distance. It is also checking the temperatures of workers and visitors, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\nWillie Gregory, Nike's director of global community impact, told ProPublica that the health department should have been let into the facility.\n\"If you're doing the right thing, you should give admittance to those people,\" Gregory said.\nAccording to ProPublica, at least 21 workers at Nike's five Memphis warehouse and distribution center locations have tested positive for COVID-19 as of May 18.\nNeither Nike nor the Shelby County Health Department returned a Business Insider request for comment on Saturday.\n\n  \n  Loading\n  Something is loading.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 1487388, "name": "Military Times"}, "body": "The Defense Department has dropped a policy that barred recruits who had contracted COVID-19 from joining up.\nThe Pentagon's under secretary for personnel and readiness said the military was looking at recruits on a case-by-case basis until health professionals come up with recommendations for the department.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon has rescinded a policy released earlier this month that prevented recruits who had contracted COVID-19 from enlisting or earning a military commission, the Defense Department's top manpower official told reporters Thursday.\nWhat started as an all-out ban evolved into barring those who had been hospitalized after contracting the virus. And now it's changed again. Matthew Donovan, defense under secretary for personnel and readiness, said during the press conference that he had canceled that guidance in favor of reverting back to pre-coronavirus accessions standards.\n\"At the same time, we're having our health professionals and our doctors and researchers take a look at that and come up with any recommendations that they'll provide to me and the [defense] secretary,\" he said, adding that their final decision is forthcoming.\nIn the meantime, he said, the policy is to look at each recruit on a case-by-case basis. That means a full work-up by military entrance processing station doctors, with time of diagnosis, complications and recovery taken into account.\n\n\n\n\nIf there are any indications that a recruit hasn't fully cleared the virus or is still suffering from complications, they could be prevented from moving on to initial entry training.\n\n    \n    \n      \n        Trainees wait to be in-processed at the 120th Adjutant General Battalion at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, October 30, 2019.\n      \n\n        \n          Alexandra Shea/Fort Jackson Public Affairs\n        \n    \n\nDonovan added that he had spent part of the morning on a call with Senate Armed Services Committee members concerned about the ban, after multiple lawmakers voiced concerns about the effects it would have on recruiting.\n\"If an individual can pass the Military Entrance Processing Station screening process — despite a hospitalization for coronavirus — they should be allowed to serve,\" Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, wrote to Defense Secretary Mark Esper on May 12. \"I agree that more research is needed to study the long-term effects of coronavirus on the human body. However, I do not think that the lack of research available warrants permanently disqualifying patriotic Americans from serving in the military.\"\nAs public health experts and researchers race to find treatments, develop and vaccine and generally study the latest coronavirus, there is still a dearth of information on its short- and long-term effects.\n\n\n\n\nFor the military's purposes, whether it causes irreparable lung damage could figure heavily in terms of combat readiness. And as the services brace for a resurgence in infections, it's still unknown whether COVID-19 antibodies provide immunity to re-infection, or could perhaps make someone more susceptible to a second round of the disease.\n\"It sort of depends,\" he said. \"Any infectious disease, we want to make sure they're not infectious at the time. There's a lot of unknowns about this virus right now. Are ther are there any long-term, lasting effects? That's what our health care professionals are looking at right now.\"\n\n  \n  Loading\n  Something is loading.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Today, more than 95,000 people have died in the US from the coronavirus, with 1.6 million cases reported.\nDespite the pandemic's blow to the economy, Facebook reported better-than-expected numbers for both revenue and users in first-quarter earnings, and added $44 billion to its market value the next morning.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the economic fallout from the current global pandemic, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has added more than $30 billion to his wealth in just two months.\nThe surge in Zuckerberg's net worth has earned him the title of third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranking updated on May 21. Zuckerberg is now worth an estimated $87.8 billion, rising above billionaires like Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet and fashion mogul Bernard Arnault.\nWhen Silicon Valley and the Bay Area were first told to shelter in place in mid-March, Zuckerberg was worth a paltry $57.5 billion and placed fifth on the list, according to Bloomberg's estimates. California remains under lockdown in an effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak, but Facebook's CEO has nonetheless added billions to his riches.\nThe surge in Zuckerberg's rankings is likely due to his company's growth even during a time when nearly 40 million US workers have been been laid off. Facebook showed better-than-expected first-quarter earnings reported on April 29. The company beat Wall Street expectations in revenue and daily active users, generating $17.74 billion and attracting 1.73 billion users in the first three months of 2020. The company also reported it had reached 3 billion monthly users across its family of apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. By the next morning, Facebook stock jumped as much as 8%, netting the company $44 billion in market value.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Facebook said it experienced a \"significant reduction\" in advertising demand over the last three weeks of Q1 2020. While Q1 earnings for tech companies and social platforms were relatively promising across the board, significant impact to the economy remains to be seen. Second-quarter results — covering business from April 1  to June 30 — may better represent the affect the coronavirus pandemic has had on businesses.\nIn the last two months, Facebook has also announced expansions of its business into ecommerce and video chatting. Facebook recently debuted Messenger Rooms, a video chat service for up to 50 people at the time as services like Zoom and Houseparty see significant bumps in use. Just this week, Facebook said that the core platform, as well as Instagram, were getting an e-commerce feature called Shops that would allow businesses to add virtual storefronts to their profiles.\nZuckerberg is third on the rankings of the world's richest behind Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates.\n\n  \n  Loading\n  Something is loading.", "categories":

Hundreds of \"mask slackers\" failed to comply with the law during the pandemic, leading to their arrests. \nThere were 1,000 reported deaths in the city in mid-October 1918. By February 1919, after the city emerged from lockdown too soon and some protested the mask law, 3,000 had been killed.\nThen and now, masks aren't a silver bullet in containing respiratory diseases, but they can help.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Francisco and the surrounding region has been lauded across the US for its stringent compliance with public health orders during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.\nIt was one of the first to enter a shelter-in-place order on March 17. But it also happens to be the birthplace of the poster child of anti-mask sentiment during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.\nThe city enforced the wearing of masks during the 1918 pandemic. But some residents were dismissive, wearing them improperly out of apathy or to smoke, leading to hundreds of arrests. And some heartily fought back against the enforcement, believing that the masks were unsanitary, useless, and a threat to their constitutional rights. \nAn \"Anti-Mask League\" was formed in January 1919 in San Francisco, with its members — dubbed \"Sanitary Spartacans\" — fighting for the mask-wearing mandate to be repealed.\n\n\n\n\nThey eventually got their way, but only after San Francisco became one of the worst-hit cities in the US. Eventually, 45,000 residents were infected.\nAnti-mask rhetoric is again present in the modern-day COVID-19 health crisis, as some protest mask-wearing and government shutdowns designed to stunt the spread of the disease.\nHere's how San Francisco's so-called \"mask slackers\" and the Anti-Mask League clashed with city officials over laws mandating that residents cover their faces to help in the fight against the flu in 1918 and 1919.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7-15", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB7-15",

Schirf, who left Citadel in October 2018 after 20 months in the role, most recently served a non-compete and then spent time as an adviser, according to her LinkedIn.\nSchirf's responsibilities will be focused on developing a growth plan for the data that sits within Tradeweb, which operates trading venues in bonds, derivatives and exchange-traded funds. She'll report to Enrico Bruni, the head of Europe and Asia for Tradeweb.\nA spokesperson for Tradeweb confirmed the hire. eFinancialCareers previously reported on the move. \n\n\n\n\nSchirf's hire is further evidence of the resources Tradeweb — and the fixed-income market as a whole — are putting towards leveraging information. Long viewed as opaque, fixed-income markets have become increasingly transparent thanks to the rise of electronic trading and the trade data made available as a result. \nTradeweb, specifically, has shown a desire to focus on the data it is able to collect via its platform. In May 2019, Caius Howcroft, Citadel's former head of platform technology, was named head of data and platform architecture, a newly-created role.\nMore recently, Drew Carey, previously the head of market data sales at Cboe Global Markets, joined Tradeweb in April as the global head of market data sales. Carey will serve on Schirf's team.\nSchirf is no stranger to helping trading venues get the most out of their data. She previously served as the head of business development for the global information services division at Nasdaq.\n\n\n\n\nLee Olesky, CEO and cofounder of Tradeweb, has previously spoken to Business Insider about how important he views data as a part of the future of business.\n\"There's a lot of room for each of the markets we're in to become more and more digital,\" Olesky told Business Insider in February. \"You generate all this data and now I can use machine learning and algorithms to figure out how to find whatever it is I want to do at the best price with more and more sophisticated tools.\"\nOlesky doubled down on that sentiment when speaking to Business Insider as part of its analysis of the long-term impact the coronavirus would have on Wall Street and the world.\nTradeweb was among a handful of electronic trading venues that played a key role in helping to keep the bond markets running as extreme volatility plagued the markets in March. \n\"Companies like Tradeweb have played a critical role in keeping markets moving, and when this is over I believe our customers will continue to look to us for help in understanding where the market is, what the price should be, and who is the best counterparty for a trade,\" Olesky said.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

The president owns the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.\nThe Post reported that the carts are rented from the New York-based Associates Golf Car Service, which has supplied the vehicles on each of Trump's visits to Bedminster.\nIn past years, similar rentals have taken place ahead of one of Trump's visits to his club, according to The Post.\n\n\n\n\nFederal records showed that the Secret Service paid Associates Golf Car $95,000 for the service last year, and $118,000 the year before.\nIt is unknown whether Trump has a trip planned this time around — The Post noted that the Secret Service also protects his family, including his daughter Ivanka, who visited Bedminster last month despite stay-at-home coronavirus orders.\nThe contract, which was signed on Monday, lasts until October 31.\nThe Post counted that Trump has played golf 250 times at his resorts throughout his presidency. HuffPost calculated that these trips have cost taxpayers $133.8 million.\n\n\n\n\nA report released in March showed that Secret Service agents racked up a $950,000 bill during a single trip to Trump's

Crew, and True Religion.\nCiting people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported on April 14 that the department store chain was exploring bankruptcy after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to temporarily close all of its 850 stores.\nOn April 15, CNN Business reported that the company had missed a debt payment and invoked a 30-day grace period. It also skipped a second payment on May 7. The company has nearly $4 billion in debt. \n\n\n\n\nIn a May 14 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, JCPenney said it had made a $17 million interest payment. \nIt began to reopen stores in certain states at the beginning of May, implementing safety measures like plexiglass at registers and contactless curbside pickup. \nJCPenney has faced years of struggles, failing to turn a profit since 2011. Like many other department stores, it's faced slumping sales as shoppers increasingly turn to online options and mall foot traffic declines. It has also faced stiff competition in off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Ross Stores. Frequent changes to the executive team and shifting strategies did not help matters.\nIt attempted to rebrand itself several times, first chasing after younger shoppers before reverting back to trying to attract middle-aged women shopping for their family. \n\n\n\n\n\"JCPenney hasn't created an experience that solidifies a place in consumers' shopping habits,\" Kathy Gersch, executive vice president of the consultancy firm Kotter, told Business Insider's 2018.

But by the week of March 16, all of the company's US employees — except those who need to be on-site to maintain servers — had moved to remote work, using a combination of Microsoft Teams and Zoom to stay in close contact with colleagues.\nThat's when SAP realized it needed a plan to keep the company running if managers became sick with the virus.\n\"As we were all deciphering this information, a very practical question was asked by our global leadership team,\" Healey said. \"What happens if some of our leaders get sick?\"\nOver the course of a week, SAP's HR team created new emergency succession plans for everyone in its 3,000 leadership roles, a process that included organizing training for potential successors. \nNext, the company started taking what it describes as other \"precautionary measures,\" including slowing hiring and decreasing discretionary spending.\n\"[SAP] will continue to hire carefully selected people into roles that will rapidly contribute to our competitive edge,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider, including in \"essential areas\" such as research and development. \nAll interviews are now conducted virtually, SAP said, but its hiring process has otherwise stayed the same. New hires are onboarded virtually and sent SAP-issued equipment to their private addresses so they don't have to go to the office. The company is also offering all its employees what it calls \"crisis leave\": ten days off that don't count against their vacation or sick days (right now, workers can take those days through the end of the month). \nOne change Healey expects to last after the pandemic ends is a new routine of regularly surveying employees and customers. \n\"The ability to listen to customers and employees became so critical during COVID and the really scary weeks in mid- to late March,\" he said The company will continue to more frequently survey its 100,000 employees across 180 countries after the crisis ends, as well as its customers around the world.\nGot a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com, message her on Twitter @ashannstew, or send her a secure message through

A second wave of coronavirus outbreaks is a real risk, and the markets are not pricing in that risk, according to the bank. Just look to South Korea, which recently saw a flare-up in new cases stemming from night clubs, despite flattening the curve. The bank noted that COVID-19 cases are still rising in the US outside of New York, just as lockdown restrictions begin to ease across the country.\n\n2. Investors are \"flying blind\" given that more than 30% of SP 500 companies have withdrawn forward-looking earnings guidance, \"and the ratio of positive vs. negative sentiment on corporate earnings calls is the worst since 2012, making valuation and fundamental investing harder than ever,\" the bank said.\n\n3. There's a growing disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street, evidenced by the fact that the SP 500 index has rallied 30% while more than 36 million Americans lost their jobs. This disconnect will only fuel a rise in populist politics ahead of the November 2020 election.\n\nBank of America\n\n4. \"The greatest risk\" to equities according to the analyst note is Congress acting too slow to pass additional stimulus measures, especially with the congressional budget coming into focus this spring. More stimulus is necessary because \"when companies and households are saving, only public spending can end a recession.\" If Congress stalls in passing additional stimulus, \"a big market correction to 2,650 may be necessary to focus [their] mind,\" the bank said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Bank of America is tactically bearish and favors credit until there's a market correction, it does observe one tactical buy signal that is flashing right now: sentiment.\n\nSentiment among investors is at an extreme bearish level, which is considered to be a contrarian buy signal by many investors.\n\nAccording to Bank of America's Bull  Bear indicator, sentiment currently reads at 0.0 out of 10, representing extreme bearish investor positioning and supporting a 3,000 SP 500 price target when combined with fiscal stimulus measures.\n\nThis Bank of America signal echoes a recent investor sentiment poll that showed investors are the most bearish they have been since April 2013.\n\nBank of America", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB13", "level": 1, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13", "parent": null}, "score":

Only 14%, at most, kids aged 1 to 17 with the disease were admitted to the hospital. \nBut new reports of children with COVID-19 coming down with, and sometimes dying from, a mysterious respiratory illness dubbed \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome\" has parents understandably on edge. \nThe syndrome had affected at least 100 children and killed at least three in New York alone by May 12. In Europe, where it was reported earlier, there were at least 100 cases in seven countries by April 30.\nHere's how to spot symptoms of both conditions in your child:\nSymptoms of COVID-19 in kids is similar to those in adults \nLike adults, children who come down with COVID-19 may experience the following symptoms: \n\nCough\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nFever\nChills\nMuscle pain\nSore throat\nNew loss of taste or smell\n\nAlso like adults, this list isn't exhaustive and continues to evolve as more people are tested and diagnosed. For instance, some people, including children, who test positive have other symptoms like a runny nose, vomiting, or diarrhea. \n\nSymptoms of the rare inflammatory syndrome being seen in kids include gastrointestinal issues \nPediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome seems to appear after kids have come down with COVID-19.  \nWhile at first doctors weren't sure if or how the condition was connected to the coronavirus, a study published May 13 in the Lancet found there was a \"strong association\" between the two. \nThe medical community's best theory is that the syndrome is \"due to the immune response of the patient,\" Dr. Jeffrey Burns, a critical care specialist at Boston Children's Hospital, told CNN.\nThe syndrome has been likened to rare childhood conditions such as Kawasaki Disease or toxic shock syndrome.

following several bombshell developments in the Justice Department's case against him and his role in the FBI's Russia investigation.\nThis week, acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell declassified the names of government officials who were involved in \"unmasking\" Flynn's name in intelligence reports monitoring the communications of Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the US.\n\"Unmasking\" is a term the intelligence community uses which refers to revealing the identity of someone on a monitored communication.\n\"Unmasking\" is legal and typically occurs when intelligence officials need more context about the surveillance on a foreign actor to make sense of the information they've received.\nIn Flynn's case, the National Security Agency was monitoring Kislyak's communications and discovered he was discussing Russian sanctions with a US person whose identity was masked.\nFlynn's identity was later unmasked as US officials determined if they needed to investigate whether he violated federal law.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe controversy surrounding former national security adviser Michael Flynn made headlines again this month following several bombshell developments related to the Justice Department's case against him and his role in the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\nLast week, the department abruptly moved to drop its case against him, sending shockwaves through the country and raising fresh concerns that President Donald Trump's Justice Department, led by Attorney General William Barr, was putting politics above the rule of law.See the rest of the story at Business InsiderNOW WATCH: How waste is dealt with on the world's largest cruise shipSee

Additionally, \"there is less distortion from heat in the air, and if it is not too cold, there won't be any chimneys producing heat,\" he said.\nIn 2019, Bendheim captured air traffic by accident while trying to photograph star trails, which are \"the continuous paths created by stars, produced during long-exposure photos,\" according to EarthSky.\n\nThough he didn't mean to shoot the air traffic, he describes it as a \"nice mistake.\" \"The air traffic noise was an interruption that created unexpected trails in the sky,\" he said.\n\"The traffic you see in the year-old photo is airplanes heading to LaGuardia or JFK. Some of them are also police, tourist, or traffic TV helicopters flying around,\" he said.\nIn the photo from 2020, the lines are from star trails, with no interruptions from air traffic.\n\n\"In the photo taken the same week a year later under lockdown, you're only seeing the star trails as circular even lines. The dot in the left side is the North Star,\" he said. \nThe photos illustrate just how much air traffic has been affected by the coronavirus\nA previous Business Insider report analyzed flight data from OAG, an aerospace data and consulting company.\nAccording to that data, during the first full week of April 2020, there were only 287,760 flights globally compared to April 2019, which saw 733,576 flights. That means the total number of flights fell 60.8% year-over-year.\nIn North America, there were 102,319 flights in the first week of April 2020, compared to 204,297 flights in April 2019, meaning that the total number of flights fell about 50% year-over-year, according to the report.\n\nRead more:\nUS will temporarily shrink operating hours at 100 air traffic towers\nCoronavirus demolished air travel around the globe.

ABC reported that due to his frail health, Manafort will be allowed to serve out the rest of his sentence in home confinement. \nManafort was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in March 2019 after being convicted on multiple federal charges between two separate cases that unfolded as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \nManafort was found guilty on eight federal counts of bank and tax fraud by a jury in Virginia in August of 2018. He also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and one count of conspiracy against the US in a case run out of the DC US Attorney's office. \nEven after being sentenced to federal prison, state-level prosecutors in New York and Virginia began considering prosecuting Manafort on additional state charges.\nIn March of 2019, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. initiated a case that resulted in a grand jury indicting Manafort on 16 counts of fraud-related felony charges including mortgage fraud, falsifying business documents, and conspiracy. \nBut in December 2019, a New York federal judge dismissed all 16 of the Manhattan DA's charges against Manafort, ruling that violated \"double jeopardy\" rules that protect defendants from being charged with the same crimes twice. \nManafort, 71, has suffered health troubles while in prison. In December 2019, he was admitted to the hospital for a \"cardiac event\" but has since recovered.  Join the conversation about this story »                        NOW WATCH: Pathologists debunk 13

Even as some states begin to reopen malls, the food courts still remain largely empty.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFrom hanging out under the fluorescent lights of the Sbarro sign to grabbing a slice of greasy pizza after a long day of strolling the aisles of a video store, we can all remember the pure bliss of spending time at our local food court.\nHowever, this once vibrant hallmark of American consumerism is in danger of extinction. By 2022, analysts estimate that at least one out of every four malls in the US could be shut down.\nThe onset of the coronavirus pandemic caused most malls nationwide to close temporarily. However, even as some states begin to reopen, mall food courts are still largely deserted.\nBefore the mall food court becomes a complete thing of the past, take a look back at how they got their start, how they've changed in the last four decades, and how the coronavirus threatens their already uncertain future.Before shopping malls had food courts, visitors could sit and eat in cafe areas like this one in Southdale shopping mall, circa 1957.\nGuy Gillette/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\nSouthdale mall is the oldest fully enclosed, climate-controlled shopping mall in the United States. It opened in 1956.\nThe first successful mall food court was opened at Paramus Park shopping mall in Paramus, New Jersey, in March 1974. It was located on the second floor of the shopping mall, which also happened to be the first enclosed shopping plaza in New Jersey.\nDiners at the Southdale mall food court continue to have plenty of choice.\nMarlin Levison/Star Tribune/Getty Images\nWhile a cafe was the main source of food for Southdale shoppers in the 1950s, the mall now offers restaurants such as Cheesecake Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings, and PF Changs, as well as on-the-go options like Qdoba Mexican Eats, Panda Express, Shake Shack, and Smashburger.\nMall food courts as we know them today have been around since the 1970s, but they quickly grew in popularity during the 1980s and 1990s.\nWilliam Smith/AP\nAs seen in the above picture of Harborplace mall — an $18 million complex of boutiques, cafes, and fast-food stalls in the Baltimore Inner Harbor — mall food courts were once bustling sites for locals and visitors alike.\nSee the rest of the story at Business InsiderSee Also:Check out these wild photos of

For all of the generations, 2012 is a big year, according to Twenge: it's the first year when the majority of Americans owned a smartphone. That's also around the time that the oldest Gen Zers entered high school — and it's when the youngest of Gen Z was born.Indeed, a 2018 paper published in Joule found that, in 2012, Americans ages 18 to 24 spent 14 more days at home than they did in 2003. As Twenge reported in \"iGen,\" college students in 2016 spent four less hours a week socializing with friends and three fewer hours partying than their late 1980s counterparts.And, according to Twenge, another trend that might accelerate during the pandemic is the deteriorating state of Gen Z's mental health.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, around 3.2 million US teens — 13% — said they had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Compared to 15% of millennials, 37% of Gen Z is likely to report fair or poor mental health, The American Psychological Association reports. And, in 2017, the second-leading cause of death for Gen Z was suicide.Twenge said the physical isolation Gen Z is facing \"doesn't bode well for happiness and mental health.\"And graduating during the pandemic could only compound that decline in mental health. As Business Insider's Dominic-Madori Davis previously reported, recession graduates are at a higher risk of dying earlier from \"deaths of despair.\"\"We find that cohorts coming of age during the deep recession of the early 1980s suffer increases in mortality that appear in their late 30s and further strengthen through age 50,\" wrote the authors of a January 2020 National Bureau of Economic Research paper.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear what Gen Z will look like on the other side of the pandemic, but pre-pandemic isolation already took a toll on its members.\"An hour a day less spent with friends is an hour a day less spent building social skills, negotiating relationships, and navigating emotions,\" Twenge wrote in iGen.\n \n Loading\n Something is loading.", "categories": [{"confident":

Andrew Cuomo said the toll takes New York \"right back to where we started this hellish journey\" in a briefing Sunday.Some reopening is set to continue on May 15. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nNew York reported 207 new deaths due to the novel coronavirus on Sunday, the lowest since early March, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo at his daily press briefing. The state also reached its lowest new daily case count ⁠— 521 — since about March 20, Cuomo said, adding that, \"521 takes us right back to where we started this hellish journey.\"\"It has been a painful period of time between March 20 and May 9,\" he said.The governor ordered non-essential workers to stay home on March 20, when there were roughly 7,000 total cases. Less than two days later, the case count reached 10,000, climbing to more than 340,792 in a matter of weeks, according to data compiled by The New York Times.\n\n\n\nMore than 25,000 New Yorkers have died, which is about 30% of total deaths in the US. The number of new deaths has been dropping for 10 straight days, as Bloomberg News reported; hospitalizations and cases that require intensive care have also declined. Given the declines, reopening of the state is set to begin as planned, the governor said. The lockdown is set to expire on May 15. This week, officials will be evaluating which regions can reopen based on a \"uniform set of criteria,\" Cuomo said.The first set of variables will rest on the rate of the virus' spread, while the second looks at locales' hospital capacity, testing, and ability to monitor compliance of new rules, according to Cuomo. More information on the subject will be released tomorrow.The governor also addressed concerns about the state's high death count in nursing homes, where more than 5,300 have died. New rules will require the homes to report to the state's health department when they can't properly care for those with the coronavirus. \n\n\n\nCuomo has been criticized in recent weeks for a directive on March 25 that said long-term care facilities were not allowed to deny people readmission on the basis of their diagnosis, which may have introduced more outbreaks. The state's health department is looking into 85 cases of what could be a coronavirus-related illness in children, but the governor had few updates to provide on the subject.  The illness has killed at least three children in the state. New York's allocated portion of the coronavirus treatment remdesivir was also discussed on Sunday. Cuomo said the state had enough of the drug for 2,900 people. Last week, hospital administrators had no idea how to procure Gilead's treatment, while the federal government declined to release its plans for distribution, according to reporting by Business Insider's Andrew Dunn, Lydia Ramsey, and Kimberly Leonard. \n\n\n\nOn Saturday, the US Department of Health and Human Services finally released guidance saying that remdesivir would be sent to states with the worst outbreaks first.\n \n Loading\n Something is loading.", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB11-3", "level": 2,

I'm just letting you know that I can help you preserve our infrastructure if things ever get really bad. I'm a patriot first, businessman second.\"Nevertheless, the US government did not take Bowen's offer following email communications that lasted several days with senior officials including Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and emergency response, according to the Washington Post. \n\n\n\nAs of April 16, the federal government has roughly 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks in its national emergency stockpile, Business Insider's Tyler Sonnemaker previously reported. That's less than 1% of the 3.5 billion estimated masks we need this year. \n \n Loading\n Something is loading.\n \n \n \n\n\n \nHealthcare workers are desperate for face masks N95 masks are crucial for public health, but especially in healthcare settings. Health and human services Secretary Alex Azar previously said at a Senate subcommittee meeting that the US needs at least 300 million more masks to fight the coronavirus pandemic. As the US has reached the fourth month since its first detected case of coronavirus, healthcare workers are still facing severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, and critical medical supplies, Business Insider previously reported. The CDC reported that more than 9,200 American healthcare professionals have contracted the coronavirus in the past two months, and thousands of those workers have died. \n\n\n\nDoctors and nurses have even resorted to reusing their N95 masks. It is unclear whether these masks are safe for people to use more than once. Corporate giants are stepping in to meet the demandAmid the medical supply shortages during the coronavirus pandemic, major manufacturing companies are stepping in to help. For example, Ford announced on March 24 that it is partnering up with 3M, General Electric, and United Auto Workers to produce respirators, ventilators, and plastic medical face shields. A growing list of tech billionaires like Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla's Elon Musk also pledged to donate medical supplies to hospitals, Business Insider previously

But the number of deaths is unlikely to drop as soon as spread is in decline.The country's number of new daily coronavirus cases hit a peak on April 24 with more than 38,000 Americans testing positive for the virus. On Friday, more than 29,000 new cases were reported. But experts warn that a drop in the amount of new daily infections does not necessarily lead to an immediate drop in the number of daily deaths, since it takes weeks for people diagnosed with COVID-19 to exhibit severe symptoms. Once a person is infected, the virus lingers for a long time.\n\n\n\n\"COVID-19 is a rather slow disease, Benjamin Neuman, chair of biological sciences at Texas A University-Texarkana, told Business Insider. \"It takes two to three weeks after infection for a person to be in critical condition or to die, so death curves generally follow along behind infection curves, something like one to two weeks delayed.\" Why the lag in numbers? The trend Neuman describes was clear in South Korea, which became the second-most infected country after China in early March. Even as new coronavirus cases were starting to flatten, South Korea witnessed a spike in its number of daily deaths. On March 3, the country reported 851 daily new cases — its highest in a single day — and four deaths. But South Korea's highest daily death toll was recorded roughly three weeks later, on March 24, when nine people died of COVID-19 in the country. A similar process has happened in New York. In early April, Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported that the state was flattening its curve. That has proven true, but a month later, the state continues to record a drop in the number of new daily cases while reporting a substantial number of deaths each day.During a press conference on May 3, Cuomo said the death toll has remained \"obnoxiously and terrifyingly high.\" \"It's going to seem as though things are getting better and worse at the same time, which is going to be confusing for a lot of people,\" Neuman said, adding, \"case numbers lag about a week behind reality.\"\n\n\n\nThis death-rate trend could change, however, as new treatments are developed and doctors and researchers continue to learn more about the disease. Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this month issued an emergency use authorization for the antiviral drug remdesivir.Siddappa Byrareddy, an associate professor at Nebraska Medical Center, said the medical community also knows more now about the coronavirus attacks the body than they did a couple moths ago.\"By providing early treatment, we are able to slow the progression of the disease in the body,\" he said. \n \n Loading\n Something is loading.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

The chart starts at the highest level of non-farm payroll employment at the beginning of each of the 11 post-war recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, and then shows the percent decline in the following months until employment returns to the pre-recession high.The chart gives a fascinating look at how deep each recession was in terms of job destruction, while at the same time showing how long it took the economy to return to normal. Many historical recessions were relatively shallow and short, but more recent downturns have tended to take a longer time to return to pre-recession employment peaks.The Great Recession that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis, shown in blue below, was previously the worst post-war US economic downturn. Employment fell 6.3% between the December 2007 peak and the February 2010 low during that period, and it took a full 76 months — over six years — for employment to finally catch back up.\n\n\n\nDespite that, the reduction in employment over the last two months dwarfs any decline from the rest of the chart. The number of Americans in non-farm payroll jobs has already fallen a whopping 14.0% from the February 2020 peak, as businesses have shuttered and companies have furloughed and laid off employees en masse in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Much of that occured in April, when over 20 million jobs were lost in a single month.Here's our version of McBride's chart, with the current downturn in dark red:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

Helping merchants weather the effects of the pandemic benefits both sellers and Visa because helping merchants continue to operate effectively can enable Visa to bring in more payments volume both during and after the pandemic.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Business Insider Intelligence\n \n \n Two of Visa's new efforts are targeted at helping merchants survive the pandemic as the crisis complicates their operations.Visa is postponing almost all planned US interchange and fee changes to April 2021. The move further extends the planned delay, which had been from April 2020 to July 2020. This is likely because the changes would have raised rates for some merchants, and businesses may not be able to afford increased expenses as the pandemic cuts into sales. There is one exception: Visa intends to move forward with plans to lower fees for supermarkets now, possibly because supermarkets provide essential goods and stand to benefit from lower fees during the pandemic.It's also delaying the deadline for gas stations to upgrade their payment systems to accept EMV chip and contactless payments to April 2021. This is a vestige of the EMV liability shift that occurred in the US in 2015, which made merchants that haven't migrated to EMV chip technology liable for fraud that occurs in their transactions. Fuel payments were set to make the same transition in October 2020, but Visa is now giving merchants additional time to adjust because the pandemic's potential impact on staffing and supply chains may be making it harder for retailers to upgrade their technology.These changes should position Visa's merchants to better survive the pandemic, but as the crisis continues, the card network may eventually have to consider enforcing deadlines that may hurt sellers. While some US states are starting to reopen businesses, many consumers appear to be wary of returning to shopping as they did before the pandemic, potentially setting merchants up to struggle for an extended period.It's possible consumer spending won't return to normal until consumers feel safer, which could require better testing and tracing capabilities or a vaccine, the latter of which may take years to develop. This means that merchants' sales could still be lower than their pre-pandemic levels in April 2021, and Visa may again have to decide whether to enforce policies that could hurt struggling merchants but improve its own performance.Want to read more stories like this one?

In the same time period the year before, Zoom use grew only 6%.Okta's daily tracking of app log-ins also shows dramatic swings correlating to global events like California's shelter-in-place order.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has changed the way the world works as businesses have closed their offices and become fully remote. New data from identity-management company Okta shows huge spikes in video conferencing and security apps as workers tried to stay connected and safe, with Zoom, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, and Citrix seeing the biggest usage boosts. \"You can see in the data people making this work,\" Okta CEO Todd McKinnon told Business Insider. \"It's a comprehensive change in how people connected and protected their companies.\" Okta, which makes single sign-in and security products, analyzed data from its network of nearly 8,000 customers between January 13 and March 31 to measure how organizations are working from home. It tracked the percentage increase in the number of unique users who logged in at least once to determine the fastest-growing apps. In a nutshell: Users zoomed into videoconferencing and put on the seatbelts of security apps.\n\n\n\nZoom had the highest growth. Both beloved by users and besieged by security issues, the video conferencing tool experienced 110% growth in unique users in March over February, according to Okta's data. That's compared to its 6% growth during that same time period last year. Four of the top five apps had to do with cybersecurity. Two virtual private network (VPN) tools that provide secure internet for remote workers also saw impressive growth, according to the data. Palo Alto Networks' GlobalProtect app showed 94% usage growth in March over February, compared to 20% for that same period in 2019. Cisco AnyConnect use grew by 86%. Citrix ADC, which adds a layer of security to other apps, grew 56%. Notably, Silicon Valley cybersecurity company Proofpoint also popped up twice on Okta's chart of fastest-growing apps. Its instructional tool Security Awareness Training was the fifth-fastest growing app, with 40% growth in March over February, while its coworking tools popped up in 10th place with 22% growth in usage.McKinnon says the cybersecurity spikes were both unheralded and very important. \n\n\n\n\"There was a lot written about Zoom security issues and other video conference issues,\" he said. \"What people didn't see or discuss as much was the embracing of the security apps, and the strong multi-authentication we saw on our platform.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Daily tracking of the fastest-growing apps reflects world events in March.\n \n\n \n Okta\n \n \n Okta's daily tracking of the two-month period shows how dramatic upswings in usage actually correlated to global events. Okta saw a sharp increase in unique user logins to Zoom, Palo Alto Networks, and Cisco's VPN app on March 16 when many European countries had announced lockdown. Those apps saw another spike on March 20, when California began a shelter-in-place directive, and New York asked non-essential businesses to go remote. By the following Monday, the three apps had seen a two-week boom in log-ins of more than 150% apiece. \"It's interesting to see a direct correlation,\" McKinnon says, \"between use of these apps and what was happening in a world responding to the virus.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB19", "level": 1, "links": {"_self":

Airbnb will be issuing them new offer letters.The company is also taking the unusually thoughtful step of paying them a stipend equal to 10% of their offered base pay right now, sources say.\n\n\n\nIt's often a significant chunk of cash, and the stipends are being paid upfront — and are theirs to keep even if they turn down the updated job offer, people familiar with the matter tell us.For instance, Glassdoor says that Airbnb's average new grad base salary is about $133,000, meaning the average 10% stipend could be about $13,000.On top of the stipend, it is also granting the hirees $2,000 in Airbnb credits, which is the same amount of credits it issues to each employee each year, someone familiar with the matter tells us.While that may not be enough money — or enough Airbnb credits — to live on for a year while waiting for the Airbnb job to come through, the company still deserves credit for doing what it can under the circumstances.\n\n\n\nAmd the circumstances are rough right now: At least 32,000 workers have been laid off from 335 startups since March 11, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site tracking self-reported layoffs and companies that are hiring. But while there's an influx of people looking for new jobs, there are still slightly more tech companies, about 423 of them, being tracked by Layoffs.fyi that are hiring.Meanwhile, Airbnb has taken other cost-cutting measures as it looks to weather the pandemic, including cutting all marketing spending and pulling back on some business partnerships, while at the same time raising an additional $2 billion in debt and equity financing. Are you an Airbnb employee or insider with insight to share?

This increase coincided with Instagram users posting more Stories to meet growing demand for content from their audiences.  \"I'm definitely using Stories a lot more,\" said Erica Chan Coffman, an Instagram influencer who runs the DIY website Honestly WTF. \"There's been an exponentially higher amount of Story views and likes. People are tagging me in Stories, saying 'Look at the thing I created using the HonestlyWTF tutorial,' and I'll repost it.\"Adoption of Instagram Live — the platform's livestreaming feature — also rose in March. A spokesperson for Instagram told BuzzFeed News that Live views in the US increased 80% during the month. In its report, Klear noted that the number of Instagram users who mentioned the word \"live\" in Stories jumped 288% between March 15 and April 14.\n\n\n\nInstagram was not the only platform that saw a big jump in livestreaming last month.The number of minutes that consumers spent watching live video on YouTube rose 19% between March 12 and 25, according to a report from the social-video analytics firm Tubular Labs. Views of livestreams on Facebook also spiked during the same two-week window in March, with the number of people watching a video in real time (or replaying a livestream after it ended) increasing by 37%. And watch time for livestreams on Twitch rose 16% during the same period. \"A ton of people are going live right now,\" said Elena Taber, a lifestyle influencer with 108,000 Instagram followers. \"Every time I open up Instagram, the Live feed is being used by four or five different influencers.\"\"We've seen live content really skyrocket, and specifically on Instagram,\" said Ellie Jenkins, an influencer-innovation manager at the marketing firm Mavrck. \"There are far more Live bubbles at the top than ever before with everyone's desire and need to feel connected to their friends, their families, and their audiences.\"\n\n\n\nAs part of its study of influencer behavior on Instagram during the coronavirus outbreak, Klear's research team surveyed 1,021 Instagram creators who had an average of 51,400 followers. The company focused on changes that occurred after March 15, when many countries, states, counties, and cities began implementing shelter-in-place measures. Here are four key takeaways for influencers and marketers from Klear's report:", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB12-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self":

New York will still hold its congressional and state-level primaries on June 23.New York Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs has said that the cancellation of the state's presidential primary would mean a lower expected turnout and a reduced need for polling places.\"It just makes so much sense given the extraordinary nature of the challenge,\" Jacobs said last week.\n\n\n\nLocal election officials and voting groups have called on the state to use federal funds to purchase cleaning supplies and protective gear, and boost staff ahead of 2020 elections.Both the state's Democratic Party and Gov. Andrew Cuomo have said they didn't ask election commissioners to make the change, which can happen because of a little-known provision in the recently passed state budget that allows the New York board of elections to remove names of any candidates who have suspended or terminated their campaign from the ballot.The decision to cancel a Democratic primary is left up to Democratic state election commissioners.Former Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders announced earlier this month that he had suspended his campaign. In a Sunday letter, a lawyer for the Sanders campaign asked the commissioners not to cancel the primary.\n\n\n\n\"Senator Sanders has collaborated with state parties, the national party and the Biden campaign, to strengthen the Democrats by aligning the party's progressive and moderate wings. His removal from the ballot would hamper those efforts, to the detriment of the party in the general election,\" the lawyer, Malcolm Seymour, wrote in a letter obtained by The Wall Street Journal.While Sanders suspended his campaign April 8, he is still staying in the race and collecting delegates to be able to influence the Democratic party platform at the Democratic National Convention scheduled for this summer.Currently, Biden has 1,280 pledged delegates in the Democratic primary compared to 947 for Sanders, according to estimates from Decision Desk HQ and the University of Virginia Center for Politics.  New York voters can now choose to vote with an absentee ballot in the June primaries under a Cuomo executive order that adds the risk of acquiring COVID-19 as a reason to vote absentee. Cuomo also recently announced the state is sending mail-in ballots to voters.\n\n\n\nJacobs has said it's a significant change but that the party's ready.\"It's a big process for us. We don't have many weeks to get it into place before the primary,\" Jacobs said. \"It's going to be difficult to execute but we're going to do it.\"Before canceling the presidential primary, Gov. Andrew Cuomo canceled a number of state legislative special elections and the special election for the borough president of Queens, according to City & State New York. \n \n Loading\n Something is

Despite an agreement made earlier this month by OPEC Plus, a coalition of oil-producing countries, to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day, prices have continued to free fall amid a lack of demand due to the pandemic. A negative price means that some traders and even producers may pay people to take oil off their hands, but as of Wednesday, prices have rebounded.Of course, people took to Twitter to share memes and comments on the price drop, with many expressing fake sympathy for the industry or talking about becoming an oil baron at a cheap price. Oil itself has become a broad cultural signifier for the United States' interventionist policies and has already shown up in meme culture, frequently used to comment on US foreign policy, as Mashable reported in March 2018.—Sunrise Movement 🌅 (@sunrisemvmt) April 13, 2020 Now, people are memeing the low oil prices.

(@WordWithBird) April 20, 2020 One person made an absurd, recombinant meme that appears to celebrate the oil price drop, combining a few viral elements: the \"Caramelldansen,\" a Swedish dance track popular in anime fandom, the character Chika Fujiwara from the anime \"Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War\" dancing in the background, and a moving graphic from the \"Coffin Dance\" meme featuring an oil

And Goldman Sachs Equity Derivatives Strategist Vishal Vivek says he's found a smart way for investors to take advantage in the newly inaugurated earnings season.\"We expect investors to increase focus on upside potential for these names, as management teams detail their new initiatives to increase wallet share in the online space,\" he wrote in a note to clients.Vivek's strategy involves trading away a small amount of a stock's potential upside in exchange for limiting possible losses. He's applying that to a series of companies with critical online sales initiatives, as they could convert their coronavirus-connected gains to a long-term edge.\"We recommend investors buy call spreads on these stocks to accentuate upside within a range, as management teams focus on these e-commerce initiatives on their earnings calls,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe's presenting detailed trades for two companies. For Chipotle Mexican Grill, which reports its earnings on April 21, he says, Goldman's analysts believe online takeout orders started climbing in mid-March and consumers are strongly motivated by restaurant rewards programs. Chipotle has a large one of those. Vivek says options prices imply Chipotle will move 13% after its earnings, well above the average move of 8% up or down after its last eight reports.That leads to a recommendation that investors buy the CMG $770/830 Jun-20 monthly call spread, recently offered at $35.10.Meanwhile Target might prove to be a good deal because options prices are falling and its stock has lagged the market so far this year. Vivek says it looks like its e-commerce sales were strong in March and its mix of necessities and grocery items will lead to strong sales over the long term.\"The company is competitive with Amazon on price and delivery speed,\" he added. So he suggests investors buy the $105/$115 Jun-20 monthly call spreads recently offered at $4.85 ahead of its May 20 report.\n\n\n\nThe rest of his seven recommended trades are as follows:",

New Zealand also closed its borders on March 20, denying entry into New Zealand to everyone who is not a citizen, resident, or close family member of a citizen or resident.The number of confirmed cases decreased for consecutive days beginning April 4.This isn't the first time Ardern, the leader of New Zealand's Labour Party, has been praised for her efforts — since taking office she has fought against sexism, led gun reform policies, and tried to normalize being a working mother in politics. Here's everything you need to know about the prime minister:", "categories": [{"confident": true,

Wu will be donating his 2020 salary to an Employee Relief fund, and will be joined by other executives. \"Given the shelter-in-place guidelines, we've seen declines in the number of people buying, selling, and moving during this time of uncertainty,\" Wu said in the statement. \"In response, we've announced to the company that we've made the difficult decision to reduce our team by 35%. This was necessary to ensure that we can continue to deliver on our mission and build the experience consumers deserve.\"\n\n\n\nThe coronavirus and the shutdowns that've followed have hit the previously-humming US housing market hard.Other companies in the residential real estate world have been slammed too, with Compass, a SoftBank-backed brokerage, laying off 15% of its staff last month and Redfin furloughing almost half of its agents and laying off 7% of its staff. SoftBank earlier this week said that it expects its $100 billion Vision Fund to book an annual loss of $16.5 billion as its tech bets sour. House-flipping is a low-margin business and profitability is closely tied to market conditions and the ability to shave off operational costs. iBuyers use technology to quickly evaluate a home's value and purchase the home with all-cash offers, rapidly renovate and repair it, and then sell it at a profit.Opendoor, last valued at $3.8 billion, was the first iBuying company, but has attracted some competition. Zillow launched its iBuyer business, Zillow Offers, in April 2018 in Phoenix, Arizona, the home of the iBuying phenomenon, and real estate brokerage Redfin launched its Redfin Now program in January 2017 in the Inland Empire region of southern California.  \n\n\n\nZillow lost roughly $5,000 per home it sold in 2019 and finished the year with 2,707 yet-to-be sold homes on its balance sheet.",

More than 25,500 people have died.An animated map shows the outbreak's progression across the country since the first case was confirmed in January.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nOn January 20, the US reported the first coronavirus case on American soil — a traveler who'd returned from Wuhan, China, in Washington state. In the two-and-a-half months since, cases in the country have surged. More than 600,000 people have gotten sick — far more than in any other country — and that number only includes those who've been tested. More than 25,500 people have died.The animated map below tracks the spread of the virus across the country week by week, showing when the first cases were confirmed in each state and how the outbreak has grown. A timeline of the coronavirus' spread in the US From January 20 to February 24, coronavirus cases were reported in six states. By March 2, the number of states grew to 11, then by March 9, cases had been confirmed in 37 states. But for a time, each state's case count remained relatively low — the only three states with more than 100 cases as of March 9 were California, New York, and Washington. However, at that time, US was not testing widely, due to errors and delays in the federal test rollout.\n\n\n\nBy March 23, every state had reported cases of the virus.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ruobing Su/Business Insider\n \n \n As of April 6, every US state had at least 100 cases. Nine states had more than 10,000, while New York state had more than 130,000. As of Monday, more than half of all states — 27 — have more than 1,000 cases. Thirteen have more than 10,000, and nine have more than 20,000, including New York, which has more than 195,000.Here's where the US cases have been reported, county by county:Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last week that he expects the US to soon start seeing the effects of lockdowns and social distancing reflected in its epidemic curve.\n\n\n\n\"I think we're going to start to see soon, within the next week or so, kind of a plateauing out and a turning around,\" Fauci said. \"We've got to be cautiously optimistic, not be overconfident. But I think we're going to start seeing that.\"", "categories": [{"confident": false, "id": "IAB14-6", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB14-6",

Amazon's spokesperson confirmed his death in an email to Business Insider.\"We are saddened by the passing of a member of our management team in Hawthorne, California. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting his fellow colleagues,\" the spokesperson said.It's unclear where Tuzara first contracted the disease. His last day at work was March 6, as he went on a vacation to Mexico until March 20. Shortly upon returning to the US, Tuzara started experiencing illness on March 26 and was subsequently hospitalized, Amazon's spokesperson said. Amazon has been in contact with Tuzara since late March and is talking to his family every day, the spokesperson said. \n\n\n\nNonetheless, Tuzara's death could further ignite calls for Amazon to build safer working conditions for its warehouse and delivery workers. Groups of employees have expressed concerns over the company's weak safety measures over the past month, staging employee walkouts across several facilities. There have been reports of at least 74 Amazon facilities with an infected employee, according to the Washington Post. The Hawthorne facility, called DLA8, is one of the six warehouses in Southern California to have been infected by the disease, according to an LA Times report earlier this month. Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment on the exact number of employees affected by the disease.In response, Amazon has pledged to add some new safety measures, like providing face masks and regular temperature checks for all of its warehouse employees. It's also increased the hourly pay throughout April, while offering paid time off to those diagnosed with the disease. Amazon is hiring an additional 75,000 new warehouse employees, after having hired 100,000 new workers over the past month.Still, Amazon has sparked controversy over the way it handled employee calls for better working conditions. Last month, it fired Chris Smalls, the warehouse worker who organized the walkout at its Staten Island facility. On Monday, it fired three more office workers who had been critical of Amazon's response to the coronavirus pandemic.Lawmakers across the country have been critical of Amazon's way of handling workers' protests. Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted on Tuesday urging Amazon to provide a safer workplace.\n\n\n\n\"Instead of firing employees who want justice, maybe Jeff Bezos—the richest man in the world—can focus on providing his workers with paid sick leave, a safe workplace, and a livable planet,\" Sanders wrote.Some of Tuzara's friends have left an emotional message in a letter mourning his death that has been circulating Amazon warehouses lately.\"Gerry was an Air Force officer, a loving husband, son and uncle,\" the letter said. \"He will be greatly missed.\"", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id":

More than 486,000 people have gotten sick — far more than in any other country — and that number only includes those who've been tested.

By March 2, the number of states grew to 11, then by March 9, cases had been confirmed in 37 states. But for a time, each state's case count remained relatively low — the only three states with more than 100 cases as of March 9 were California, New York, and Washington. However, at that time, US was not testing widely, due to errors and delays in the federal test rollout.\n\n\n\nBy March 23, every state had reported cases of the virus.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ruobing Su/Business Insider\n \n \n As of April 6, every US state had at least 100 cases.

The Ad Studio allows interested parties to create audio ads from scratch and manage Spotify campaigns from one location — it's ideal for small businesses looking for a fast, low-cost means of reaching music fans. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Business Insider Intelligence\n \n \n The Ad Studio first launched in 2017 and was, until now, only available in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. With the international expansion, Spotify is increasing the number of targetable geographies from 2,000 to 180,000, as well as adding new CTA options such as Share or Shop Now.As most consumers are quarantined in their homes, early data suggests the loss of commuting time appears to be having an adverse impact on time spent with audio content:Music streaming. According to analytics firm Alpha Data, music streaming has declined in the past few weeks. In the period between March 13 through March 20, streams across music streaming services like Spotify and Pandora pulled 9% fewer streams than the week prior, with the drop-offs the highest in the pop, rap, R, and Latin Music genres. Interestingly, the classical, folk and children's genres saw an increase in streams — likely as consumers gravitate towards more calming music or genres that appeal to their homebound children.Podcast streaming. Since early March, US podcast listening has been trending down as well — in the week of March 15 to March 22, the total US podcast audience fell 8% week-over-week, after declining 2% in the week prior according to Podtrac. Among the top podcast categories, the True Crime genre saw the largest drop-off with the weekly audience year-to-date falling 6%.For Spotify, offering low-barrier, targetable options to a wider pool of small businesses will likely help stave off a serious revenue decline even as listening takes a hit. With most small businesses — especially restaurants — losing access to regular foot traffic, local brand awareness is likely a top concern. Spotify's international expansion will provide a novel way for many small businesses to reach their local communities with its wide list of targetable geographies.Moreover, the low barriers that the Ad Studio provides to ad creation will likely appeal to cash-strapped small businesses: Any advertiser can simply upload a script to the ad studio and within 48 hours they will have a fully produced ad in their native language, a service that Spotify reports 37% of advertisers already take advantage of.While we think this expansion will help Spotify mitigate some of the negative effects of the pandemic, it's worth noting that it likely has limited upside right now, due to the current economic climate. That's especially true for small businesses, who are hit hard by the coronavirus. Want to read more stories like this one?

{"author": {"avatar_url": null, "id": 2447818, "name": "Helena Wasserman"}, "body": "South Africa has been under strict lockdown since March 27, despite only a small number of Covid-19 deaths in that country.No-one is allowed out for exercise, and the sale of alcohol, cigarettes, and clothing has been banned.The country's president has just sanctioned a government minister for visiting a friend's house. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nAmid one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, South Africa's minister of communication has been put on leave from her job for having lunch with a friend.South Africa has effectively been shut down since March 27, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed before a single person died of the novel coronavirus in the country. Authorities moved fast amid concerns about the high percentage of the population with compromised immune systems, which would make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. South Africa has among the highest prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis in the world. But so far, only 13 people have died from Covid-19 in the country of almost 60 million people – due in part to the stringent lockdown. Streets are deserted as movement outside of residences is restricted to grocery shopping and visiting the doctor. Exercise or dog walking is not allowed. The sale of alcohol, cigarettes, clothing, homeware and all other goods deemed non-essential is illegal. South Africa has also banned fast-food deliveries. With South Africans now effectively confined to their own homes, many stripped of an income, the Instagram picture of the 42-year old Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams enjoying lunch at the home of a friend instantly spread on social media – to massive outrage.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, less than a day after the photo first surfaced, President Cyril Ramaphosa put the minister on two months' leave, one of which will be unpaid, and said he was \"unmoved\" by her excuses for the outing – her friend earlier claimed that she was picking up a donation of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer. Ramaphosa said the law must be allowed to take its course in determining whether she breached lockdown regulations. He also demanded a public apology, which Ndabeni-Abrahams delivered shortly thereafter, asking South Africans to \"find it in your hearts to forgive me\".She wasn't the first public figure to flout new coronavirus-related rules. On Sunday Scotland's chief medical officer, Caroline Calderwood, resigned after she visited her country home during lockdown – twice. Earlier this week, New Zealand's health minister, David Clark, was demoted after being photographed going biking and taking his family to the beach.Ramaphosa's next big challenge will be a decision whether to extend the current lockdown, which is supposed to be lifted on April 17.While the country is rolling out mobile coronavirus test stations, so far testing has not been widespread and there are concerns that with the arrival of colder autumn temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere it may be too early to lift restrictions. The current stringent measures have also brought unexpected benefits.  \n\n\n\nMany emergency rooms are unusually quiet as the impact of restrictions on travel and alcohol sales ban are seen in fewer car accidents and a sharp fall in crime. In the first week of lockdown, only 94 murders were recorded in the country – from 326 in the same week in 2019. The number of rapes were down 86%. Still, the enormous damage to an economy which was already grappling with sky-high unemployment and a recession — even before the pandemic — may persuade Ramaphosa to at least ease restrictions.", "categories": [{"confident": true, "id": "IAB20-2", "level": 2, "links": {"_self": "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB20-2", "parent":

It lasted in the US from December 2007 until June 2009, and the economic contraction resulted in two straight years of declines in US ad spending.More than 10 years later, as the new coronavirus spreads around the world, the US faces what looks to be another recession.In 2008 and again in 2009, spending on US advertising declined—including an almost 18% drop in spending in 2009. With many businesses in financial distress and consumers keeping wallets shut, marketers were forced to be conservative.Digital ad spending declined in 2009 as well, but only by single digits—and that was after eking out an increase in spending in 2008. At the time, digital was a relatively small share of total ad budgets, and digital advertising was still playing catch-up in terms of its share of ad spending vs. consumer attention. Digital's measurability made it attractive to frugal marketers looking to drive performance.In Looking Back at the Great Recession as the World Faces a Coronavirus Pandemic, eMarketer examines the current advertising atmosphere amid the coronavirus pandemic relative to the Great Recession more than a decade ago. Here are some key takeaways from the report:Today, digital is a more significant chunk of budgets compared to the Great Recession.The nature of this downturn is different, with supply and demand shocks—many of which may not be felt yet or at all, depending on the course of the pandemic and governments' responses to it.Not only do consumers spend more time online and with mobile devices than they did a decade ago, their media usage habits are evolving in the face of large-scale social distancing.In full, this report:Provides a look back at our estimates of US ad spending during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.Includes a revised outlook over time.Discusses what is and isn't applicable to the coronavirus pandemic from the Great Recession.Interested in getting the full report?
