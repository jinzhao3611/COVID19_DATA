"Eventually treated like a human diorama by the tourists who traveled to peer at them through the glass triangles of their quarters , the terrestrial astronauts ( terranauts ? ) who volunteered to sequester themselves in a collection of seven mini - biomes were tarred as a naive cult at best , and charlatans at worst .","Eventually treated like a human diorama by the tourists who traveled to peer at their through the glass triangles of their quarters , the terrestrial astronauts ( terranauts ? ) who volunteered to sequester themselves in a collection of seven mini - biomes  the terrestrial astronauts ( terranauts ? ) who volunteered to sequester themselves in a collection of seven mini - biomes in a collection of seven mini - biomes were tarred as a naive cult at best , and charlatans at worst ."
"“ Spaceship Earth ” helpfully deconstructs those accusations , first by delving into the project ’s origins in 1960s San Francisco , when a charismatic Oklahoma transplant named John Allen gathered a group of bookish , artistically inclined young people to get things going , whether in the form of experimental plays , a farm in New Mexico or an oceangoing ship that they built from scratch in Oakland , Calif.","“ Spaceship Earth ” helpfully deconstructs those accusations , first by delving into the project ’s origins in 1960s San Francisco , when Allen gathered a group of bookish , artistically inclined young people to get things going , whether in the form of experimental plays , a farm in New Mexico or an oceangoing ship that a group of bookish , artistically inclined young people built from scratch in Oakland , Calif."

"With a wealth of archival material to work with , Wolf does a superb job of sending viewers back into the 1980s and 1990s — whose scratchy , juddering VHS - era production values and “ Galaxy Quest”-worthy uniforms might be tough on the eyes , but are note - perfect in conjuring the time period .","With a wealth of archival material to work with , Wolf does a superb job of sending viewers back into the 1980s and 1990s — whose scratchy , juddering VHS - era production values and “ Galaxy Quest”-worthy uniforms might be tough on the eyes , but are note - perfect in conjuring the time period ."

"Anyone who fears going stir crazy at a time when going to the store is more akin to scrubbing in for surgery than running a light errand will relate when tensions rise and systems begin to break down ; if the Biospherians ’ two - year sojourn in the Arizona desert proved anything , it might be just how much a whiff of fresh air can do .","Anyone who fears going stir crazy at a time when going to the store is more akin to scrubbing in for surgery than running a light errand will relate when tensions rise and systems begin to break down ; if the Biospherians ’ two - year sojourn in the Arizona desert proved anything , it might be just how much a whiff of fresh air can do ."
