A polar vortex that remained above the polar region without weakening and a strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) were among a combination of factors that led the contiguous U.S. to experience higher - than - normal temperatures from December 2019 through February 2020 .,A polar vortex that remained above the Arctic without weakening and a strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) were among a combination of factors that led the contiguous U.S. to experience higher - than - normal temperatures from December 2019 through February 2020 .
