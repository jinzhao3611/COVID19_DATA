"The UK ’s variable climate , which scientists recently suggested was responsible for disguising some of the impacts of the climate crisis while the impacts in other parts of the world are growing more obvious , makes it crucial to understand why some parts of the UK are wetter or drier than others and to discern long - term trends .","The UK ’s variable climate , which scientists recently suggested was responsible for disguising some of the impacts of the climate crisis while the impacts in other parts of the world are growing more obvious , makes it crucial to understand why some parts of the UK are wetter or drier than others and to discern long - term trends ."
"For instance , extreme years – a year - long drought in 1921 and the notoriously wet summer of 1912 – can tell scientists a lot , and their understanding will be vastly improved if the weather sources from those years can be viewed at last .","For instance , those years – can tell scientists a lot , and scientists understanding will be vastly improved if the weather sources from those years can be viewed at last ."
