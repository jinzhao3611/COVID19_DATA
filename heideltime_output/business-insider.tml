Addressing the nation via a video conference , Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear that the threat could only be combatted with the full cooperation of the people , a token demonstration of which , he said , would be to light candles , lamps and mobile torches for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT9M">nine minutes</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">April 5</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2020-04-05T21:00">9 pm</TIMEX3> .
“ There is no bigger force than our conviction and resolve .
There is nothing we can not achieve with these forces , ” he said .
Many are wondering when the world is busy fighting Covid-19 and scientists are trying to make a vaccine against the virus why did we first bang thalis , then blow conch shells and then were asked to light candles .
People want to remind the government that they have always shown solidarity at the time of a national calamity or crisis — be it the devastating <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> tsunami or the global economic meltdown in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> or the massive floods in Uttarakhand in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> .
Even <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , millions of migrants left jobless have reconciled themselves to the situation .
The people of India do not need gimmicks to prove their collective will , the history of India is proof itself .
Countries such as South Korea , Hong Kong and Singapore had launched huge nationwide testing programmes to identify , isolate and treat infected patients from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2021-01-20">January 20</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2021-03-19">March 19</TIMEX3> but even <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">today</TIMEX3> , the government has not launched mass testing .
It ’s time that the government demonstrated its dedication to Indians through actions to eliminate and not count on banging thalis or lighting candles .

Govt may consider allowing flight operations in staggered manner post lockdown .
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2020-04-05T17:52:11">2020-04-05 17:52:11</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The government may consider allowing flight operations in a staggered manner after the 21 - day nationwide lockdown ends on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2020-04-14">April 14</TIMEX3> , officials said on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Except Air India , all other airlines have been taking bookings for commercial passenger services from <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> .
Officials said the government may consider allowing operations of passenger flights from <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> in a staggered manner , at the same time suggesting that flights may not be allowed to operate on all sectors .
Reacting to reports on likely resumption of flights , Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri called them " mere speculation " .
He referred to a tweet by him on <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> stating that a decision on resumption of flights after the end of the lockdown period remains to be taken .
India suspended domestic and international commercial passenger flight operations from midnight on <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2020-03-24">March 24</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DURATION" value="P21D">21 days</TIMEX3> in sync with the nation - wide lockdown .
However , cargo flights , medical evacuation flights , offshore helicopter operations and flights permitted on special ground by the aviation regulator DGCA were allowed to operate during the period .
" about resumption of passenger flights in a staggered manner from <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">15 April</TIMEX3> is mere speculation .
The correct position is spelt out in my tweet of <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">2nd April 2020</TIMEX3> , " Puri tweeted on <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> , he had tweeted : " The <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> lockdown on both domestic and international passenger flights is till <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> .
A decision to restart the flights after this period remains to be taken .
If required , we will have to assess the situation on a case by case basis . "
Asked at a press conference on <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> about resumption of international flights , Puri had said : " Air India had first cancelled the flights to China , then the other carriers stopped flying . "
" So far as the lockdown is concerned , the lockdown is till <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> .
And , we can start considering the resumption of flights on a case - by - case basis depending on where they are coming from after that , " he said .
When asked about resumption of passenger flight services , Civil Aviation Secretary P S Kharola 's statement at the briefing indicated that the government direction is very clear that the lockdown is up to <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="2020-04-14">April 14</TIMEX3> .
" As far as post that ( <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DATE" value="2020-04-14">April 14</TIMEX3> ) is concerned , it is all up to airlines .
Airlines have to judge the situation and they can take the bookings , " he had said on <TIMEX3 tid="t69" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> .
" In case the lockdown gets extended , then the same process ( of cancellation ) has to be followed , and if the lockdown is not extended , then the bookings will be honoured , " said the secretary .
Like many other countries , civil aviation sector has been hit hard in India too following restrictions of flight operations due to the coronavirus pandemic .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> , Air Deccan became the latest casualty of the crisis as it announced indefinite suspension of flight operations and asked all employees to go on sabbatical without pay .
As revenues have fallen significantly due to the coronavirus crisis , IndiGo has announced a pay cut of up to 25 per cent for its senior employees .
Another airline , Vistara , too has announced a compulsory leave without pay of <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DURATION" value="P3D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to three days</TIMEX3> for its senior employees .
SpiceJet has stated that its employees ' salaries would be reduced between 10 to 30 per cent while the Air India has announced a 10 per cent cut in allowances for every employee , except cabin crew , for the coming <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .
GoAir has cut salaries of its employees , laid off its expat pilots and introduced leave without pay for employees on a rotational basis .

Relaxing banks' stress: Staggered <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DURATION" value="P180D">180-day</TIMEX3> bad loans breather on cards .
<TIMEX3 tid="t77" type="TIME" value="2020-04-05T16:39:16">2020-04-05 16:39:16</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and the ministry may take up the issue of relaxation in the delinquency period for the classification of banks ’ non - performing assets ( NPAs ) to <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DURATION" value="P180D">180 days</TIMEX3> , from <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DURATION" value="P90D">the current 90 days</TIMEX3> .
The rescheduling of accounts classified as overdue , stressed or as on <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DATE" value="2019-12">December 2019</TIMEX3> without being downgraded , and fresh funding ( with a minimum repayment period of <TIMEX3 tid="t92" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">24 months</TIMEX3> ) is to be considered .
<TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="DATE" value="2020-05">This may</TIMEX3> include going easy on the insistence for additional collateral as a pre - condition by The NPA delinquency relaxation to <TIMEX3 tid="t101" type="DURATION" value="P180D">180 days</TIMEX3> “ may be heavily qualified to prevent its abuse ” , said a source .
The staggered NPA relaxation glide path can be expected to have ‘ start - stop dates ’ , which will finally settle down to the <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> 90 - day timeline by the close of <TIMEX3 tid="t102" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t103" type="DATE" value="2021">21</TIMEX3> .
The interest accrued , but not received after <TIMEX3 tid="t111" type="DATE" value="2020-01-01">January 1 , 2020</TIMEX3> , may be allowed to be repaid in six <TIMEX3 tid="t117" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> instalments from <TIMEX3 tid="t113" type="DATE" value="2020-10-01">October 1</TIMEX3> to end - <TIMEX3 tid="t114" type="DATE" value="2021-03">March 2021</TIMEX3> .
This ties in with the possibility of the delinquency period for classification of being extended to <TIMEX3 tid="t119" type="DURATION" value="P180D">180 days</TIMEX3> .
A key concern is that the three - month moratorium on term loans by the central bank , and its linkage to the account being ‘ regular ’ to avail of the same , may lead to a situation wherein weaker borrowers come under even more stress .
“ These borrowers may default and get downgraded as under the <TIMEX3 tid="t124" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> norms due to their inability to service the interest component on which there is no breather , ” said a source .
“ This is especially since sales in the <TIMEX3 tid="t129" type="DATE" value="2020-06">June 2020</TIMEX3> quarter will be extremely poor .
Their ability to get fresh financing will also be under a cloud , ” he added .
The amount that can avail of by way of refinance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development , National Housing Bank , and the Small Industries Development Bank of India is also to be looked at .
A reference may be made to International Accounting Standard 10 pertaining to ‘ events after the reporting period ’ .
Its applicability to the Indian context is said to have been examined .
Receipts , payments , recoveries , or provisions made or received up to <TIMEX3 tid="t139" type="DATE" value="2020-09-30">September 30 , 2020</TIMEX3> , could be considered while finalising the accounts for <TIMEX3 tid="t136" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t137" type="DATE" value="2020">20</TIMEX3> ( FY20 ) .
Or an additional <TIMEX3 tid="t141" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> will be captured in banks ’ accounts for FY20 .
It has been gathered that ‘ talks with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI ) have been initiated on this aspect ’ .
The additional provisioning norm under the central bank ’s <TIMEX3 tid="t144" type="DATE" value="2020-06-07">June 7</TIMEX3> circular and incorporation of a three - month breather in its key trigger points may also be warranted .
The additional provisioning have to comply with under the <TIMEX3 tid="t148" type="DATE" value="2020-06-07">June 7</TIMEX3> circular is as follows — 20 per cent after <TIMEX3 tid="t151" type="DURATION" value="P180D">180 days</TIMEX3> from end of the review period ; and 15 per cent after <TIMEX3 tid="t152" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> ; or a total additional provisioning of 35 per cent .
It was given to understand that the central bank ’s insistence that the three - month moratorium ‘ shall be contingent on lending institutions satisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from Covid-19 ’ , has been flagged off to both its senior decision - making levels and to North Block .
Borrowers , especially micro , small and medium enterprises , service the interest just in time before the 90 - day NPA norm kicks in .
It was suggested to the RBI that it could have said the account should have been ‘ standard ’ — that is , it is not an NPA or a special mention account — rather than insist it should be ‘ regular ’ .

Italy donated PPE to China; <TIMEX3 tid="t153" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> China wants Italy to buy back the same PPE .
<TIMEX3 tid="t157" type="TIME" value="2020-04-05T09:55:06">2020-04-05 09:55:06</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
At the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in China , Italy had donated Personal Protection Equipment ( PPE ) to China and <TIMEX3 tid="t158" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> when Italy is in dire need of PPE , China wants to sell them to Italy , according to a report in the Spectator magazine .
The China - originated bug , which crossed continents to make Italy its epicentre in Europe ,
wreaked havoc on its people , especially the frontline warriors- the doctors and nurses .
Within days , more than 15,000 people were killed and over a lakh others got affected by the dangerous pathogen .
In an attempt to restore its humanitarian image following the crisis , China projected to the that it would donate PPE to Italy .
But later it was revealed , it was not a humanitarian gesture but a business-
Beijing had actually sold , not donated , the PPE to Italy , several media reports claimed .
A senior Trump administration official was quoted by The Spectator as saying that it is much worse than that and China " forced Italy to buy back the PPE supply that it gave to China during the initial coronavirus outbreak . "
" Before the virus hit Europe , Italy sent tons of PPE to China to help China protect its own population , " the administration official explained .
" China then has sent Italian PPE back to Italy -- some of it , not even all of it ... and charged them for it , " he added .
Unfortunately , China 's diplomacy in the wake of the pandemic outbreak has been slippery .
Much of the supplies and testing kits that China sold to other countries have turned out to be defective .
Spain had to return 50,000 quick - testing kits to China after discovering that they were faulty .
In some cases , instead of apologizing or fixing the issue , China has blamed its defective equipment on others .
It condescendingly told The Netherlands to ' double - check the instructions ' on its masks , for example , after The Netherlands complained that half of the masks they were sent did not meet safety standards , the media reported .
" It 's so disingenuous for Chinese officials <TIMEX3 tid="t159" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to say we are the ones who are helping the Italians or we are the ones who are helping the developing when , in fact , they are the ones who infected all of us , " the senior administration official said .
" Of course they should be helping .
They have a special responsibility to help because they are the ones who began the spread of the coronavirus and did not give the information required to the rest of the to plan accordingly , " he added .
The official also said that China 's ' disinformation campaign ' of lying to the world about the seriousness of its COVID-19 outbreak has further delayed the response by countries .
As China downplayed the outbreak within its borders , nearly half a million people traveled to the US potentially carrying the virus , the official said .
As the lethal virus paves its way through continents and various territories across the globe , killing people in millions and crippling economies , China has still been underreporting about the accurate figures in the mainland .
The country has also claimed no new deaths from the virus , even as thousands of ash urns are shipped to local hospitals .

Amid virus fears, Pakistan searches for pilgrims from mass gathering .
<TIMEX3 tid="t163" type="TIME" value="2020-04-04T19:50:21">2020-04-04 19:50:21</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Pakistani authorities are searching for tens of thousands of worshippers who attended an Islamic gathering in Lahore <TIMEX3 tid="t164" type="DATE" value="2020-03">last month</TIMEX3> just as the novel coronavirus was taking root in the impoverished nation , officials said on <TIMEX3 tid="t165" type="DATE" value="2020-04-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Authorities want to test or quarantine those who congregated at the Tablighi Jamaat -- an Islamic missionary movement -- from <TIMEX3 tid="t168" type="DATE" value="2020-03-10">March 10</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t169" type="DATE" value="2020-03-12">March 12</TIMEX3> amid fears they are <TIMEX3 tid="t170" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> spreading COVID-19 across Pakistan and overseas .
Organisers say about 100,000 people went to the meeting , which took place despite government requests to cancel it in light of the worsening coronavirus pandemic .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , an official at Lahore 's district commissioner 's office told AFP the gathering 's location outside the eastern city has <TIMEX3 tid="t171" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been sealed off .
" Authorities in all districts ( of the country ) are trying to find those who have attended the event , " the official said .
About 2,500 attendees -- including 1,500 foreigners -- who had remained around the event site , which includes a mosque and sleeping quarters , have been placed in quarantine .
So far , at least 154 worshippers who went to <TIMEX3 tid="t172" type="DATE" value="2020-03">last month</TIMEX3> 's Jamaat have tested positive for coronavirus , with two fatalities to date , authorities told AFP .
Working through word of mouth and from lists of names provided by Jamaat organisers , officials have so far tracked down approximately 7,000 attendees in Punjab province and placed them in quarantine .
Tablighi Jamaat is considered one of the world 's largest faith - based movements , with millions of followers , particularly in South Asia .
It sends preachers to countries to spread Islam 's ideals .
According to organisers , a number of foreign nationals also attended <TIMEX3 tid="t173" type="DATE" value="2020">this year</TIMEX3> 's gathering from countries including China , Indonesia , Nigeria , and Afghanistan .
About 1,500 foreigners are <TIMEX3 tid="t174" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> quarantined in Pakistan , but others left the country without being tested .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t176" type="DATE" value="2020-03-23">March 23</TIMEX3> , Gaza 's health ministry confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus were Palestinians who had attended the gathering .
Pakistan 's Science Minister Fawad Chaudhry expressed exasperation the Jamaat took place , and blamed " the stubbornness of the clergy . "
" Any group of people who will not adhere to the government advice and will continue to do their normal activities will become a danger to others , " he told AFP .
Speaking to AFP , senior Tablighi preacher Naeem Butt said it was " ignorant " and " irresponsible " to blame the movement for spreading the virus .
" We cancelled our event after <TIMEX3 tid="t177" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> when the authorities told us to do so , " he said .
At the time , organisers blamed rainy weather , not the virus , for ending the event .
Coronavirus has killed at least 41 people in Pakistan , though with only limited testing available , observers worry the number is far higher .

It quoted sources who said all railway safety personnel , running staff , guards , TTE and other officials have been told to be ready to join from <TIMEX3 tid="t253" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> .
It said the railways has issued a “ restoration plan ” to all its zones with a schedule of trains to be run , their frequency and the availability of rakes .
All 17 zones have been sent a missive to be prepared to run their respective services , the source said .
Hours later , the railways clarified that no final decision has been taken yet on restoration of train services .
“ Train services will resume only on specific approval of each train from the Railway Board .
Suggestions for phase - wise planning should be given to the board , ” an official said .
This decision was taken after a video conference of railway minister Piyush Goyal with chairman of Railway Board on <TIMEX3 tid="t254" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> , said officials .
Trains , however , will begin operations only after receiving a green light from the government .

Where will the bodies go? Morgues plan as virus grows .
<TIMEX3 tid="t258" type="TIME" value="2020-04-04T17:57:58">2020-04-04 17:57:58</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
There are the new dead .
And then there are the bodies waiting in overcrowded mortuaries to be buried as cities struggle to meet demand and families wrestle with rules on social distancing that make the usual funeral rituals impossible .
Med Alliance Group , a medical distributor in Illinois ,
is besieged by calls and emails from cities around the country .
Each asks the same thing : Send more refrigerated trailers so that we can handle a situation we never could have imagined .
They 're coming from all over : From hospitals , health systems , coroner 's offices , VA facilities , county and state health departments , state emergency departments and funeral homes , said Christie Penzol , a spokeswoman for Med Alliance .
It 's heart - wrenching .
The company has rented all its trailers and there 's an 18 - week wait for new materials to build more , she said .
With U.S. medical experts and even President Donald Trump <TIMEX3 tid="t259" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> estimating the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic could reach 240,000 nationwide , the sheer practicalities of death where to put the bodies are worrying just about everyone as cities , hospitals and private medical groups clamor to secure additional storage .
The need is compounded by private mortuary space that is occupied longer than usual as people wait to bury their loved ones regardless of how they died because rules on social distancing make planning funerals difficult .
It 's a crisis being repeated worldwide .
In Spain , where the death toll has climbed to nearly 12,000 , an ice rink in Madrid was turned into a makeshift morgue after the city 's municipal funeral service said it could no longer take coronavirus bodies until it was restocked with protective equipment .
In Italy , embalmed bodies in caskets are being sent to church halls and warehouses while they await cremation or burial .
And in the coastal Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil , macabre images and pleas from families on social media show dead loved ones wrapped in plastic or cloth , waiting for days to be taken away by overwhelmed morgue workers .
In the U.S. epicenter of New York City , where the death toll was nearly 1,900 on <TIMEX3 tid="t260" type="DATE" value="2020-04-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> , authorities brought in refrigerated trucks to store bodies .
At Brooklyn Hospital Center , a worker wheeled out a body covered in white plastic on a gurney and a forklift operator carefully raised it into a refrigerated trailer .
Cities and states that have n't been hard - hit yet are trying to prepare for the worst .
It 's hard to say exactly how much morgue space is available nationwide .
Many cities and counties submit emergency preparedness plans for review by state and federal officials , but tallies are n't always complete and private mortuaries are n't always included .
Trade groups like the National Association of Medical Examiners do n't track those capacities either .
But , in general , few morgues in the country can hold even 200 to 300 bodies .
In Washington , D.C. , which has a morgue that can hold about 270 bodies , officials said they would seek help from federal partners if needed .
Dallas has a plan for refrigerated space as part of its emergency preparedness efforts .
And Chicago is already using a trailer outside the medical examiner 's office for the bodies of coronavirus victims , and may use a refrigerated warehouse if needed .
Meanwhile , the Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked the Defense Department for 100,000 body bags , Pentagon spokesman Air Force Lt . Col . Michael Andrews said <TIMEX3 tid="t264" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
On a daily basis , the system works at essentially full capacity in most jurisdictions , said Robert A. Jensen , co - owner of Kenyon International Emergency Services , a private disaster response company based in Texas .

Coronavirus may bug diesel may after gasoline, jet fuel price crash .
<TIMEX3 tid="t274" type="TIME" value="2020-04-04T14:10:04">2020-04-04 14:10:04</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The world over , one mainstream fuel -- -- has managed to remain a decent profit center for the oil refining industry at large as the novel ravages economies and their wider demand for petroleum products .
has risen in value relative to crude in <TIMEX3 tid="t275" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> due to a combination of continued industrial usage and purchasing of a near - identical fuel for stockpiling as a heating oil in Europe .
In addition , there have been curbs in refining to minimize a glut of products like gasoline and jet fuel .
But diesel ’s star is starting to fade , with its premium to crude oil <TIMEX3 tid="t278" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> dropping in trading hubs around the world .
As refiners try to maximize output of the fuel and with only a finite amount of land - based storage , it may be just a matter of time before the market starts to collapse .
“ It feels like we ’re running almost at full tilt into a brick wall , ” said Steve Sawyer , director of refining at Facts Global Energy .
Diesel ’s premium to crude in northwest Europe dropped to under $ 10 a barrel on <TIMEX3 tid="t285" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> , after settling at a little over $ 17 -- the highest since <TIMEX3 tid="t282" type="DATE" value="2019-10">October</TIMEX3> -- on <TIMEX3 tid="t284" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">March 30</TIMEX3> .
The premium , or so - called crack spread , has also dropped dramatically in Singapore and on the U.S. Gulf Coast in <TIMEX3 tid="t288" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
Until <TIMEX3 tid="t291" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , has been somewhat shielded from the troubles plaguing jet fuel and gasoline , which have tumbled in value as airlines ground flights and governments impose restrictions on people ’s movement .
Because of the collapse of those markets , refiners have been focusing on diesel production instead , building up a potential problem for the future .
The extent of the possible oversupply is unclear .
Diesel margins in Europe are likely to be hit first , Sawyer said , adding that the continent ’s relatively high number of diesel - powered passenger vehicles makes the fuel there potentially vulnerable to coronavirus - related lockdowns that sap demand .
Tankers hauling millions of barrels of unwanted product from Asia and Russia will further add to supplies .
America is also seeing waning demand .
Pilot Company , the country ’s biggest truck stop company , said diesel sales across its business were strong <TIMEX3 tid="t292" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several weeks ago</TIMEX3> , when the World Health Organization declared the a pandemic .
Since then , diesel sales have dipped , <TIMEX3 tid="t294" type="DATE" value="2020-W14">this week</TIMEX3> down about 10 - 15 % as industrial plants , other businesses and cities shut , according to Pilot Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Haslam .
Refineries across the globe have been curbing production as the outbreak spreads .
If supply drops enough , then the risk of a diesel glut will subside .
One factor to watch will be the amount of fuel that moves into storage .
In Europe ’s Amsterdam - Rotterdam - Antwerp region , diesel and gasoil supplies in independent storage are near their lowest seasonal levels in <TIMEX3 tid="t295" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> , data from Insights Global show .
Distillate inventories in the U.S. have also declined , according to government data .
“ We do n’t actually expect to see that much diesel end up in stock in the <TIMEX3 tid="t296" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> , ” said Eugene Lindell , senior consultant at JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna .
“ This is because it is the only product that is short , and therefore the only product that keeps refineries running .
So if demand falls more , supply will have to fall more as well . ”

Covid-19 Factoid: Rapid rise in new cases globally, but S Korea gets a grip .

Germany has overtaken China to become the fourth most impacted country , only behind the US , Italy and Spain , going by number of Covid-19 positive cases .
* 75 new cases were registered in Tamil Nadu in <TIMEX3 tid="t308" type="DURATION" value="P1D">the last 24 hours</TIMEX3> , taking the total tally to over 300 .
The state has been witnessing a major spike in Covid-19 cases in <TIMEX3 tid="t310" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the last few days</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t309" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has the most number of cases after Maharashtra .

It just took <TIMEX3 tid="t311" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> to add 200,000 Covid-19 cases across the globe .
The number of days taken to add 200,000 fresh cases to the global infected cases tally as well as the time taken to add 10,000 Covid-19 casualties is rapidly shortening .
It took <TIMEX3 tid="t316" type="DURATION" value="P122D">122 days</TIMEX3> to reach the 200,000 mark since the first Covid-19 positive case was registered on <TIMEX3 tid="t313" type="DATE" value="2019-11-17">17th November</TIMEX3> in China and <TIMEX3 tid="t317" type="DURATION" value="P67D">67 days</TIMEX3> to cross 10,000 fatalities .
At present , it takes just <TIMEX3 tid="t318" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> to attain the same number of fresh cases or deaths .

France added the most number of fatalities in <TIMEX3 tid="t322" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> Just <TIMEX3 tid="t319" type="DATE" value="2020-03-26">ten days ago</TIMEX3> , Italy ’s share in the total death toll of Covid-19 was the highest in the world .
Italy ’s share then was 29 % but has since shrunk to 13 % .
The share in the death toll of the new epicentre of the pandemic , the United States , <TIMEX3 tid="t323" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> stands at 16 % along with Spain .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t325" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">2nd April</TIMEX3> , France alone accounted for over 20 % of global fatalities .
Major reduction in the share in the number of deaths was witnessed in Italy and Spain which were earlier accounting for almost half of the overall Covid-19 deaths between <TIMEX3 tid="t328" type="DATE" value="2020-03-25">25th</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t327" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">30th March</TIMEX3> .
Apart from these four nations , the rest of the world has one - third share in the overall daily death due to South Korea saw a major spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the first week of <TIMEX3 tid="t329" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> .
At that time , the country was going through its deadliest phase – the death rate was at its peak , and the recovery rate was at its lowest and the country was adding more than 500 cases daily , on an average .
South Korea has since made significant strides in controlling the pandemic , with both metrics improving considerably in just <TIMEX3 tid="t330" type="DURATION" value="P1M">one month</TIMEX3> .
Experts have attributed this to aggressive testing and contact tracing by the government .
The number of cases being recovered daily are more than the number of new case additions .
Among the closed Covid-19 cases in the country , the outcome ratio between recoveries and deaths was almost equal during early days in <TIMEX3 tid="t331" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> .
However , South Korea made a massive comeback with the death rate reducing to less than 3 % as the recoveries have risen substantially in the country .

Coronavirus impact: Indian expats with expired visas on sticky wicket .
<TIMEX3 tid="t335" type="TIME" value="2020-04-03T17:36:14">2020-04-03 17:36:14</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Indian expatriates in the US and other countries , who have lost their jobs or have a work permit that has expired , may not be able to return before the <TIMEX3 tid="t337" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> ban on is lifted , in view of the virus outbreak .
Senior government officials have confirmed that no evacuation flights to the US are on the radar , given the surge in cases to above 245,000 ( as of <TIMEX3 tid="t340" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> ) , in the country .
“ For all jurisdictions , our first priority is students , tourists , and those on short - term visas .
However , India ’s six diplomatic missions across the US are in touch with affected citizens and preparing a tentative list of possible evacuees once and if evacuations do start , ” said a senior official in the Ministry of External Affairs .
The ministry ’s stance is based on the argument that “ Indians <TIMEX3 tid="t341" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> abroad on employment visas like H-1B work in multinational firms , draw significant wages , and in many cases have retrenchment benefits ” .
People in the know said no meetings were scheduled with the US State Department regarding the matter .
On the other hand , those stuck in the US also face no official legal guidance as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has temporarily suspended routine in - person services since <TIMEX3 tid="t343" type="DATE" value="2020-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3> .
The USCIS plans to re - open offices on <TIMEX3 tid="t345" type="DATE" value="2020-04-07">April 7</TIMEX3> .
The IT sector , a big beneficiary of H-1B visas , has been trying to sort out the issue with US authorities for some time <TIMEX3 tid="t346" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
“ In the US , we have requested the Departments of Homeland Service , Labor and U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services for a 90 - day grace period for professionals to depart the US following expiry of their H-1B/ L-1 visas .
Additionally , we have sought ease of Labor Condition Application ( LCA ) norms to allow for ‘ work from home ’ , ” said Shivendra Singh , vice - president and head ( global trade development ) of Nasscom .
The UK has announced visa extensions until <TIMEX3 tid="t348" type="DATE" value="2019-05-31">May 31</TIMEX3> for all foreign nationals , while France has also extended visas for <TIMEX3 tid="t349" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .
“ Many IT professionals in the US are at the risk of being laid off because their employers have lost end - client contracts .
Such individuals can remain in the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t351" type="DURATION" value="P60D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to 60 days</TIMEX3> , during which they can look for a new job with an employer who can file a new H-1B petition for them .
If there is no job in sight , the worker should leave to avoid running the risk of accruing unlawful presence , ” said Poorvi Chothani , managing partner of LawQuest .
Nasscom ’s Singh said people leading the MEA ’s COVID-19 efforts have confirmed they have advised Indian Ambassadors to take this up with foreign governments .
There have been reports of thousands of Indians under similar visa regimes being stuck in Japan , Australia , New Zealand , the UK , South Africa , and the UAE , among other areas .
At present , there is no standard operating procedure in place for airlifting stranded citizens from corona - hit nations , with the External Affairs ministry identifying particularly hit areas such as Iran , China , and South Korea .

Covid-19: Oil producers knock govt's door, seek relaxation in royalty, cess .
<TIMEX3 tid="t355" type="TIME" value="2020-04-02T17:11:53">2020-04-02 17:11:53</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Domestic operators have approached the government seeking a reduction and deferment of royalty , cess and profit petroleum paid by companies to the government , with the Covid-19 pandemic hitting demand and pushing international crude prices to new lows .
In addition , companies batted for a higher gas price compared to the existing $ 2.39 a million British thermal unit ( mBtu ) , effective from <TIMEX3 tid="t356" type="DATE" value="2020-04">April</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t359" type="DATE" value="2020-09">September this year</TIMEX3> .
In a letter to the finance ministry , the Association of Operators ( AOGO ) said operations are <TIMEX3 tid="t360" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> unviable owing to the higher share of government taxes .
The industry body ’s move comes after a decline in oil prices by around 60 per cent since <TIMEX3 tid="t362" type="DATE" value="2020-01-01">January 1</TIMEX3> , leading to a 97 per cent decline in operator revenue .
The operator share has shrunk to less than 3 per cent of the earlier revenue during this period .
“ The government , however , continues to take away a predominant share ( 98 per cent ) of revenue though cess , royalty & profit petroleum even in a low crude price regime .
This is forcing oil & gas operations to an unviable status , ” the letter said .
The association demanded that benefits arising to contractors from reduction in rates should be exempted from corporate income tax .
The operator group also indicated that gas prices are much lower than per barrel operating expenditure resulting in negative return .
“ We have asked the government to reduce its various shares .
In addition to this , other policy changes and timeline reconsiderations , too , along with more marketing and pricing freedom , ” said Ashu Sagar , secretary general , AOGO .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t363" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the price of Brent crude was seen at $ 27.12 a barrel .
The dip in international prices is positive for India as the country ’s import dependency in <TIMEX3 tid="t364" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t366" type="DATE" value="2020">20</TIMEX3> was around 85.1 per cent , up from 83.8 in <TIMEX3 tid="t365" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t367" type="DATE" value="2019">19</TIMEX3> .
Owing to lower prices , the import bill , too , dropped from $ 111.9 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t368" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t370" type="DATE" value="2019">19</TIMEX3> to around $ 95 billion till <TIMEX3 tid="t372" type="DATE" value="2020-02">February</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t369" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t371" type="DATE" value="2020">20</TIMEX3> .
The coronavirus pandemic has curtailed all activities and downsized the global energy demand , resulting in excess supply and low prices .
However , this lower price regime is denting the profits of domestic producers .
Based on industry estimates , domestic producers save the country more than Rs 1.7 trillion per annum with their production and consequent reduced imports .
AOGO , in its letter , added that production - sharing contracts that are due for renewal between <TIMEX3 tid="t384" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t381" type="DATE" value="2020-09">September 2020</TIMEX3> should be extended till <TIMEX3 tid="t382" type="DATE" value="2021-03">March 2021</TIMEX3> on same terms , and extension can be made effective from <TIMEX3 tid="t383" type="DATE" value="2021-04">April 2021</TIMEX3> under the PSC extension policy .
Other demands include allowing exploration cost recovery from existing revenues and removal of ceiling on gas price for difficult fields .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t385" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> ceiling price on domestic natural gas is $ 5.61 mBtu on gross calorific value basis .
The AOGO letter also asked the government to provide tax benefit for exploration and development activities by levying zero goods and services tax .

Earlier , Australia Test skipper Tim Paine had said that the team 's upcoming tour to Bangladesh slated to be held in <TIMEX3 tid="t663" type="DATE" value="2019-06">June</TIMEX3> is unlikely , conceding that one does nt need to be an " Einstein " for that amid the global crisis due to pandemic .

The series is part of the ICC World Test Championship and 120 points will be at stake for both the teams .
" You do n't have to be Einstein to realise ( the Bangladesh tour ) is probably unlikely to go ahead , particularly in <TIMEX3 tid="t668" type="DATE" value="2020-06">June</TIMEX3> .
Whether it 's cancelled or pushed back , we 're not quite sure at the moment , " Paine was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au .

Pay cut to no cricket: Here's what England Test captain Joe Root said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t677" type="TIME" value="2020-03-31T07:36:12">2020-03-31 07:36:12</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
England cricket team ’s Test captain expects his country 's cricket board and the players body to discuss a possible pay cut for him and his teammates " in the <TIMEX3 tid="t678" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> " as the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) faces the financial impact of the Covid-19 or pandemic .
With all professional cricket coming to a halt till <TIMEX3 tid="t681" type="DATE" value="2020-05-28">May 28</TIMEX3> in the United Kingdom ( UK ) and more delays expected , speculation is rife that the ECB is mulling pay cuts for its centrally - contracted players like Root and Jos Buttler .
However , the 29 - year - old is not stressing about it at the moment .
" I am sure at some point in the <TIMEX3 tid="t682" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> there will be a discussion but those discussions will probably take place between the PCA and the ECB .
Until that happens , that is not my area of expertise , " ICC ’s official website quoted Root .
" We just have to concentrate on being as fit as we can be for when we get back playing cricket and making sure we are doing everything we can to look after the community , " he added .
The cornavirus outbreak , which has infected over 7,00,000 people and caused more that 37,000 deaths worldwide , has forced the global sporting events to come to a standstill .

Here 's what Root said about the workload
But when normal cricket does resume , Root is bracing himself for an exponential increase in the workload .
" It would be a very tough <TIMEX3 tid="t688" type="DATE" value="2020-WI">winter</TIMEX3> , a huge amount of workload , especially on the multi - format players , but we have had some tough winters in the past and found ways to get through them . "
" It would be interesting to see how they would fit it in looking at the schedule as it <TIMEX3 tid="t689" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3>
but if it was to go ahead , we would have to be able to adapt , look at the squad sizes we take over and make sure guys were n't blown out and overworked .
With uncertainty looming , the skipper has kept an open mind regarding the scheduling .
" If we are lucky enough to be in a position where we can play then we should try but whether Tests overpower other formats is going to be difficult to know .
We have to be very open minded . "
Governments all across the world are calling for imposition of lockdowns and Root , like several other athletes , is also confined to his house .
The right - hand batsman , who has turned to home workouts , feels nothing can compare to training together as a group .
" You can never really replicate the dressing - room environment and building something as a group of players .
" " You spend a long time working towards something collectively and that 's something you can take for granted , especially when you play as much as we do .

India 's fruits and vegetable exports are likely to decline by 30 - 40 per cent during the ongoing grape and mango season due to global lockdown that has been implemented to prevent the spread of the ( Covid-19 ) pandemic .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's announcement of a lockdown ( a measure similar to curfew ) for <TIMEX3 tid="t761" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3> beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t760" type="DATE" value="2020-03-24">March 24</TIMEX3> has brought the entire value of fruits and vegetables to a standstill .
Despite several efforts to revive mandis , distribute essentials and instruct ports to facilitate exports , the situation is far from normal .
" Farmers have prepared early mango crops - Hapus or alphonso- for exports .
Many in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra ( the hub of Hapus mango production ) had kept their consignments ready for delivery .
Several enquiries were received before the lockdown .
We hope the government will open exports with some riders .
But , most importing markets are shut and this will make it difficult to executing orders .
Thus , exports would certainly be hit , " said Abid Raien , Director , Raien Fresh Produce , a Navi Mumbai - based fruit and vegetable exporter .
Many exporters have estimated a 30 - 40 per cent decline in exports this season , as by the time markets open , grape season would be over .
Most of the mango export season would also be lost .
The fruit and vegetable trade across India is gradually coming to a standstill due to sealing of state and district borders , which has hit plying of trucks and other carriages to mandis throughout the country .
Even after easing the rules , these exporters have not become active .
They have to protect themselves and also manage cancellations of orders .
The global lockdown and trade restrictions have forced large - scale cancellation of orders .
Actual defaults of exporters and importers would be assessed after opening up the world markets .

We do n't know whether they would be able to buy from us in future also , " said a worried mango farmer from Sindhudurg .
To ease the problems at least on India 's ports , the Union Ministry of Shipping has asked its employees to handle essential services and clear consignments wherever possible with adequate care .
Meanwhile , the European Union has eased its norms for import of fruits and vegetables from India under which Indian exporters do not require to submit a physical certificate assuring food safety and animal and plant health standard .
<TIMEX3 tid="t772" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> an online certification will be sufficient .

Covid-19: Amul faces glitches in inter-state transport with <TIMEX3 tid="t834" type="DURATION" value="P21D">21-day</TIMEX3> lockdown .

Even as the country goes into a 21 - day lockdown starting <TIMEX3 tid="t839" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to contain the ( Covid-19 ) spread , Gujarat Co - operative Milk Marketing Federation ( GCMMF ) , popularly known as Amul , is facing glitches in areas like inter - state transport and supply of packaging material .
While so far it has not seen any major impact on milk supplies , the leading dairy co - operative is working with respective state and central government authorities to sort out the issues before it begins to impact supply .
<TIMEX3 tid="t840" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3> , procures 26 million litres of liquid milk <TIMEX3 tid="t842" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of which 21 million litres is from Gujarat and rest from other states such as Maharashtra , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh .
While the dairy co - operative has been able to keep up with its average daily liquid milk sales of 15 million litres of which 6.5 million litres are sold in Gujarat and rest in other states , might face issues in supplementary services , GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi told Business Standard .
" We are ensuring that milk procurement from farmers continues with safety measures being taken .
However , we are facing some problem in workers being able to reach our factories due to lockdown .
But this should be gradually sorted out as we have all the permissions in place and are in touch with the relevant authorities , " said Sodhi .
In inter - state transport , the dairy cooperative is facing delay in empty trucks coming back from other states to Gujarat after delivering milk .
While trucks full with milk and milk products are being allowed to pass inter - state borders , returning empty trucks are facing delayed re - entry due to lockdown .
Along with other states , Gujarat had also begun sealing its borders by <TIMEX3 tid="t844" type="DATE" value="2020-03-22">March 22</TIMEX3> .
" We saw that trucks that go full are allowed at state borders but empty trucks coming back face problem at entry , " Sodhi added .
In terms of transport , is also facing issues in supply of ingredients for cattle feed .
While some of the ingredients are available within Gujarat , Amul 's cattle feed plants source raw materials like rice bran , corn , millet , and molasses from other states like Punjab , Haryana and Rajasthan .
" These ingredients are crucial so that we can supply cattle feed to farmers so that milk procurement is not hampered , " he said .
Another issue that could hamper Amul 's supplies is packaging material .
" No factory gives more than a fortnight of packaging material .
They should also be allowed to operate and there workers should be provided free movement so that milk and food items ' packaging supplies do not take a hit . "
According to Sodhi , while so far these issues have not had any major impact on its supplies , GCMMF has made representations to relevant authorities to ensure smooth supplies of milk and milk products .
Meanwhile , in a video message being circulated on social media , Sodhi is also urging consumers to not resort to panic buying amidst <TIMEX3 tid="t846" type="DURATION" value="P21D">the 21 days</TIMEX3> lockdown .
" I want to reassure our Amul consumers that I have read the Ministry of Home Affairs ' notification in detail in which milk and other food items and grocery stores are allowed to remain open .
And in Gujarat we see roughly 30 million litres per day of milk production which if you divide by a population of 60 million in the state then 500 ml per person milk is available .
So there is going to be no shortage of milk .
Milk parlours will remain open .
So I request all the consumers to not get into panic buying and buy only as much is required <TIMEX3 tid="t847" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> , " Sodhi urged consumers .

India's coal stocks breach 100 mt as demand weakens in coronavirus crisis .
<TIMEX3 tid="t917" type="TIME" value="2020-03-24T11:39:55">2020-03-24 11:39:55</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
India 's coal stocks breached 100 million tonne ( mt ) as power demand weakened , leading to lower coal sales since the outbreak of the novel Coal India officials said the company continues to produce around 2.5 mt of coal daily , but less than 2 mt was dispatched to the power sector in <TIMEX3 tid="t920" type="DURATION" value="P15D">the past 15 days</TIMEX3> which led stocks to pile up drastically in its pitheads .
While the coal stocks in the Maharatna company peaked to around 60 mt , coal stocks in power plants rose to 41.41 mt – the highest ever inventory level in the country till date .
Despite the overstock situation , coal output had peaked to a new high of 3.17 mt on <TIMEX3 tid="t925" type="DATE" value="2020-03-20">20 March 2020</TIMEX3> - the highest ever single day production so far - overtaking the 3.14 mt production recorded on <TIMEX3 tid="t926" type="DATE" value="2020-03-25">25 March 2020</TIMEX3> .
Officials estimate that another 4 mt-5 mt of stock will be piled up at the pitheads by the end of the month .
Before the Covid-19 outbreak in the country , around 4.5 mt of stocks was getting added <TIMEX3 tid="t934" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EVERY">every month</TIMEX3> on the average , however , in <TIMEX3 tid="t933" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March 2020</TIMEX3> , the net stock addition is expected to be around 11 - 12 mt .
“ It is happening because of a cascading effect .
Lower industrial activity results in lower demand for power which in turn leads to lower coal demand ” , a senior Coal India official said .
In fact , during the first <TIMEX3 tid="t938" type="DURATION" value="P15D">15 days</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t936" type="DATE" value="2020-04">this month</TIMEX3> , when the scare around Covid-19 surfaced , electricity consumption stood at 51 billion units ( BU ) which is 3.6 per cent lower than the demand in the same period in <TIMEX3 tid="t935" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> .
According to data from Central Electricity Authority , the is enough for plants to produce power for <TIMEX3 tid="t940" type="DURATION" value="P24D">24 days</TIMEX3> without any supply from Coal India .
Company sources suggested that power demand , until the first week of <TIMEX3 tid="t941" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> had grown on <TIMEX3 tid="t943" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> - on - year basis , but it started to decline thereafter .
The official suggested that measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak , included work from home , implying lower power demand from offices as well as schools , colleges , malls , cinema screens , parks and other public places shutting down temporarily .
" <TIMEX3 tid="t944" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> with the lockdown in place , demand for power is expected to go down further and hence the demand for coal as well ” , the official at Coal India said .
Despite the outbreak , Coal India has n’t suspended mining operations as it feels production and supply lines of coal needs to be kept open so that power generation remains unaffected and any exigency can be addressed .
According to a Central Coalfields Ltd ( CCL - a Coal India subsidiary ) official , almost all power plants linked to CCL are directly or indirectly refusing to accept more coal supply .
“ The hurdles faced by the company have reached to an unprecedented level , so much so that the power consumers have stopped making payments ”
, the CCL official said .
On the other hand , Coal India has suspended calculation of its annual stock measurement from <TIMEX3 tid="t947" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">April 1</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t948" type="DATE" value="2020-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> after the Centre and several state governments enforced mandatory travel restrictions .

India VIX , a measure of investors ’ perception about the risk of sharp swings based on options prices , touched 86.63 on <TIMEX3 tid="t957" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , higher than its historical closing peak of 85.13 during global financial crisis in <TIMEX3 tid="t956" type="DATE" value="2019-11">November</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t955" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
According to experts , the peaking of volatility can be a lead indicator of bottoming out .
“ We think that volatility needs to stabilise before the broader market can heal .
There is precedent for this .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t958" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t959" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t960" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t961" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> , equity volatility peaked well ahead of the ultimate low , ” Morgan Stanley said in a note .

The Nifty was trading 3.4 per cent higher on <TIMEX3 tid="t964" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> ( at <TIMEX3 tid="t965" type="TIME" value="2020-03-31T14:00">2 pm</TIMEX3> IST ) .
The spike in volatility , combined with sharp daily swings , has forced futures and options traders to avoid holding onto their positions .
“ Traders should be in wait - and - watch mode and avoid leveraged trades in such volatile markets , ” said a technical and derivatives analyst .
Market participants pointed out that the volatility seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t966" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> amid the ( Covid-19 ) scare has been abnormal .
In year - to - date , the Nifty is down 35 per cent , while Sensex is down 37 per cent .

Olympics-Tokyo <TIMEX3 tid="t972" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> Games will be postponed: IOC member Dick Pound .
<TIMEX3 tid="t976" type="TIME" value="2020-03-23T21:05:50">2020-03-23 21:05:50</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Senior ( IOC ) official Dick Pound said <TIMEX3 tid="t979" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> a postponement of <TIMEX3 tid="t977" type="DATE" value="2020">this year</TIMEX3> 's Tokyo Olympics is <TIMEX3 tid="t978" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> inevitable as the world reels from the pandemic .
The IOC said on <TIMEX3 tid="t984" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> the body would wait <TIMEX3 tid="t985" type="DURATION" value="P4W">four more weeks</TIMEX3> before announcing its decision on the fate of the <TIMEX3 tid="t982" type="DATE" value="2020-07-24">July 24</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t983" type="DATE" value="2020-08-09">August 9</TIMEX3> Games , amid mounting calls for them to be rescheduled .
Pound however believes the IOC -- which ruled out a cancellation of the Games -- is <TIMEX3 tid="t986" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> laying the groundwork for a postponement .
" My interpretation of the IOC 's communications is they do n't want to cancel , and they do n't think they can continue with the <TIMEX3 tid="t988" type="DATE" value="2020-07-24">July 24</TIMEX3> date , " Pound told AFP . "
So you 're looking at the ' P ' word - postponement .
" They 're going to explore options with the Japanese of course , and then there all kinds of stakeholders -- international federations , NOCs , athletes .
"
And then in <TIMEX3 tid="t989" type="DURATION" value="P4W">four weeks</TIMEX3> they 're going to try and come out with a plan B and make it as specific as they can make it in that time period . "
Pound , who is Canadian , said the " astonishing " spread of COVID-19 across the globe left the IOC with no other choice .
" This is not something that 's going to clear up by <TIMEX3 tid="t991" type="DATE" value="2020-07-24">July 24</TIMEX3> , " Pound said .
" And this thing is n't going to go away by <TIMEX3 tid="t992" type="DATE" value="2020-09">September</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t993" type="DATE" value="2020-10">October</TIMEX3> .
A lot of the biggest countries in the world are just about overwhelmed , and it 's just starting to take root in Africa .
It 's a no - go in my view .
" A one - year postponement to <TIMEX3 tid="t994" type="DATE" value="2021">2021</TIMEX3> remained the most likely option , Pound added .
" I think the one - year postponement is the most feasible because it gives you the most time to organise , " he said .

Stock market rout: India Inc's overall m-cap declines by Rs 14.2 trillion .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1001" type="TIME" value="2020-03-23T18:01:02">2020-03-23 18:01:02</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The coveted club of companies with market capitalisation in excess of Rs 1 trillion has shrunk drastically in <TIMEX3 tid="t1003" type="DURATION" value="P1M">the last one month</TIMEX3> .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t1004" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> ’s sharp 13 per cent drop in the benchmark indices , there are only 18 listed firms in that club .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1006" type="DATE" value="2020-02-20">February 20</TIMEX3> — just before the coronavirus - induced sell - off began — there were 30 companies with an m - cap of at least Rs 1 trillion .
Several blue chips such as Axis Bank , Wipro , ONGC , Bajaj Finserv , and Titan have fallen off the list following unprecedented declines in their stocks .
If the market continues to fall , the list could shrink further , with firms such as ( L&T ) hanging on to Rs 1 trillion in m - cap with the skin of their teeth .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1009" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> , India Inc ’s overall m - cap declined by Rs 14.2 trillion to Rs 102 trillion .
Down nearly Rs 59 trillion from the peak , India ’s m - cap had stood at Rs 161 trillion on <TIMEX3 tid="t1011" type="DATE" value="2020-01-17">January 17</TIMEX3> .
Needless to say , bulk of the erosion in terms of value took place in India ’s most - valued firms .
For instance , Mukesh Ambani - led Reliance Industries alone has lost Rs 3.8 trillion in m - cap , followed by HDFC Bank , which has seen its value erode by Rs 2.45 trillion and Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) , which has lost Rs 1.85 trillion to stand at Rs 6.24 trillion , making it India ’s most - valued .
At present , RIL has an m - cap of Rs 5.6 trillion , making it the second - most valuable .
Only in <TIMEX3 tid="t1014" type="DATE" value="2019-11">November 2019</TIMEX3> , RIL had become India ’s first company to touch Rs 10 trillion in market value .
Axis Bank , which had an m - cap in excess of Rs 2 trillion <TIMEX3 tid="t1015" type="DATE" value="2020-03" mod="APPROX">about a month ago</TIMEX3> , is presently valued at Rs 87,000 crore .
The private lender is the latest to move out of the club , following a 28 per cent crash in its share price .
A further 2 per cent drop in the market would lead to India ’s overall m - cap falling below Rs 100 trillion .
India had first crossed that mark in <TIMEX3 tid="t1021" type="DATE" value="2016-11">November 2016</TIMEX3> .
Interestingly , it took India <TIMEX3 tid="t1022" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> to move from Rs 100 trillion to Rs 160 trillion .
However , the reversal has taken only <TIMEX3 tid="t1023" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> .
Given the velocity of the latest correction , many experts have termed the <TIMEX3 tid="t1024" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> turmoil in the market the ‘ worst ever ’ .
Experts believe the revival could be steep on account of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic .
“ Indian are worst - hit as the rapidly spreading pandemic has sent major states , including the country ’s capital , into a lockdown .
There are increasing fears that the outbreak could bring world economies to a grinding halt .
The OECD has warned that the world will take years to recover from the pandemic , ” says Deepak Jasani , head ( retail research ) , HDFC Securities .

Simultaneously , the government will also ask banks to offer soft loans to airlines at 1 or 1.5 percent interest rate from banks based in Gujarat International Finance Tec - City ( GIFT ) .

Delhi Lockdown: Things you need to know before stepping out from home .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1073" type="TIME" value="2020-03-23T09:38:27">2020-03-23 09:38:27</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The citizens of this country enthusiastically observed the 14 - hour - long voluntary restriction , the Janata Curfew , on <TIMEX3 tid="t1075" type="DATE" value="2020-03-22">March 22</TIMEX3> , which was meant to check on the rapid spread of the pathogen .
But were things back to normal post <TIMEX3 tid="t1076" type="TIME" value="2020-03-22T21:00">9:00 pm</TIMEX3> ?
Not really .
However , the next thing that happened , after the loud applause was Delhi Chief Minister in a briefing announced a complete shut down to control the spread of ( Covid-19 ) in the region .
The lock down kicked in from <TIMEX3 tid="t1081" type="TIME" value="2020-03-30T06:00">6 a.m. Monday</TIMEX3> and will last till <TIMEX3 tid="t1078" type="DATE" value="2021-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> .
The chief minister has mentioned that all dairies , grocery shops , chemists and petrol pumps will remain open during the period .
However , no public transport service will run , with exception of 25 per cent to help people reach essential services .
But what exactly are essential services ?
In this case , essential services that have been exempted from the lock down are : Hospitals , food and milk supplies , chemist and pharmacies , police stations , armed forces , fire , telecom , internet , postal , e - commerce , banks , media ( both print and digital ) municipal and aviation services among others , keeping in view the smooth supply chain of goods .
This means , even metro train services will remain shut till <TIMEX3 tid="t1083" type="DATE" value="2021-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> and only 25 per cent of Delhi Transport Corporation ( DTC ) buses will hit the roads .
No other modes of public transport , including private buses , taxis , auto - rickshaws , rickshaws and e - rickshaws will be permitted during the lock down period .
For the first time in its 167 - year - old history , the has also cancelled all services of passenger trains , including suburban ones , till <TIMEX3 tid="t1085" type="DATE" value="2021-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> .
The nearest equivalent of this was the 54 - day railway strike in <TIMEX3 tid="t1086" type="DATE" value="1974">1974</TIMEX3> , when trains did not run in the country .
The railways , however , said goods trains would run .
Meanwhile , the Delhi police have imposed section 144 of CrPC which prohibits assembly of four or more people in one place till <TIMEX3 tid="t1088" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> .
They have put up barricades at the border areas including Kapashera which connects Gurugram to Delhi and Vasundhara Enclave which connect Noida with the city .
Police officials at the borders were seen asking people to go back and were only allowing those exempted from the lock down order .
The CM also directed private firms to give compulsory paid leave to all employees , including contractual — until <TIMEX3 tid="t1090" type="DATE" value="2021-03" mod="END">the end of March</TIMEX3> .
So far , the total number of Covid-19 cases in India rose to 415 on <TIMEX3 tid="t1091" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> , with 15 more people testing positive in Maharashtra .
While the Delhi government has already put the capital under a lock down for <TIMEX3 tid="t1092" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> , the Centre has also ordered all the states to enforce lock down strictly .

Securities transaction tax collection up 5% on higher derivatives trade .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1096" type="TIME" value="2020-03-22T20:00:03">2020-03-22 20:00:03</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The weak markets have not had an impact on the government ’s ( STT ) kitty , which went up about 5 per cent year - on - year ( YoY ) in <TIMEX3 tid="t1097" type="DATE" value="2020">the current fiscal year</TIMEX3> to date .
According to an official in the Income Tax Department , STT collection stood at Rs 11,247 crore for fiscal year <TIMEX3 tid="t1099" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t1100" type="DATE" value="2020">20</TIMEX3> ( FY20 ) , until <TIMEX3 tid="t1102" type="DATE" value="2020-03-15">March 15</TIMEX3> , against the targeted Rs 12,500 crore .
The department is hoping that the target will be crossed .
The reason for the higher STT is heightened volumes in the futures and options segment during <TIMEX3 tid="t1108" type="DATE" value="2019-04">April 2019</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1109" type="DATE" value="2020-01">January 2020</TIMEX3> , even as volumes fell in <TIMEX3 tid="t1107" type="DATE" value="2020-02">February</TIMEX3> .
So far <TIMEX3 tid="t1110" type="DATE" value="2020">this fiscal year</TIMEX3> , equity derivatives turnover have gone up 43 per cent , while overall market turnover across both cash and derivatives segments was up 39 per cent .
Even tax payouts from dividend distribution tax ( DDT ) are up 2 per cent because of changes in the tax structure from <TIMEX3 tid="t1113" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">April 1</TIMEX3> , which require firms to shell out more on dividends in <TIMEX3 tid="t1112" type="DATE" value="2021">the next fiscal year</TIMEX3> .
Typically , collections had declined during weak market conditions or fall in stock prices , but <TIMEX3 tid="t1114" type="DATE" value="2020">this year</TIMEX3> ’s activity on the futures and options front is helping tax collections .
For instance , collection dropped below Rs 500 crore in FY13 amid a downturn in the market .
Since then , collection has been on the rise thanks to an upward trend in the market .
In FY19 , the government collected Rs 11,528 crore from STT , of which Mumbai contributed Rs 11 , 235 crore .
The market performed relatively well between <TIMEX3 tid="t1122" type="DATE" value="2019-04">April 2019</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t1123" type="DATE" value="2020-01">January 2020</TIMEX3> , but in <TIMEX3 tid="t1121" type="DATE" value="2020-02">February</TIMEX3> , the sharp sell - off sparked by the coronavirus outbreak pushed the Nifty and Sensex into bear territory , eroding billions of rupees of investor wealth .
Total derivatives trading volume fell 22 per cent in <TIMEX3 tid="t1124" type="DATE" value="2020-02">February</TIMEX3> , while in the cash segment total volumes were down 2 per cent .
Introduced in <TIMEX3 tid="t1125" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> , the STT is levied on all stock market transactions .
The tax is in the range of 0.017 per cent and 0.125 per cent of the transaction amount .
The STT rate for delivery - based trades is 0.1 per cent , while that on intra - day trades is 0.025 per cent .
Similarly , the tax levy on derivatives trade is between 0.01 per cent and 0.05 per cent , unless an option contract is exercised .
Meanwhile , DDT collection ( up to <TIMEX3 tid="t1127" type="DATE" value="2020-03-15">March 15</TIMEX3> ) stood at Rs 51,873 crore .
Of this domestic companies paid Rs 46,720 crore and mutual funds payout was Rs 5,153 crore .
In FY19 , the total collection was Rs 57,114 crore , according to data .
This is because dividends payouts were advanced by the companies in <TIMEX3 tid="t1128" type="DATE" value="2020-02">February</TIMEX3> after the Union Budget announced changes in DDT structure .
The Budget announced abolition of DDT of 20.56 per cent paid by companies , but said taxes on dividends would be levied on individuals .
Market players say companies are advancing their dividend payouts to lower the tax burden of promoters , who will have to pay tax in excess of 40 per cent from <TIMEX3 tid="t1129" type="DATE" value="2020-04">April</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1130" type="DATE" value="2020-02">February</TIMEX3> , about 200 companies declared interim dividends , which was over double that of the corresponding period <TIMEX3 tid="t1131" type="DATE" value="2019">last year</TIMEX3> .
Payouts , too , were higher than <TIMEX3 tid="t1132" type="DATE" value="2019">last year</TIMEX3> .
Total direct tax ( net collection ) up to <TIMEX3 tid="t1134" type="DATE" value="2020-03-15">March 15</TIMEX3> , however , slipped by 5.3 per cent and stood at Rs 9.57 trillion against the revised target of Rs 11.7 trillion .

The <TIMEX3 tid="t1145" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> terror attack was a series of 12 bomb explosions that rocked Mumbai ( then known as Bombay ) , on <TIMEX3 tid="t1147" type="DATE" value="2020-03-12">12 March</TIMEX3> .
The single - day attacks resulted in 317 fatalities and 1,400 injuries , according to reports .
Among the targeted locations was the building in Fort .

The stock exchanges , as a result was closed for trading on <TIMEX3 tid="t1157" type="DATE" value="2019-11-27">November 27</TIMEX3> in response to the development .
While acknowledging that the health and safety is of paramount importance , analysts say shutting the exchange <TIMEX3 tid="t1158" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> for a prolonged duration in the backdrop of COVID-19 can send a wrong signal to foreign investors .
“ Foreign investors have a huge investment in the Indian financial and shutting the exchange for long will send out a wrong signal .
That said , the authorities have taken appropriate steps to ensure safety of employees and also taken adequate measures that the investors / traders and the other stakeholders do not panic , ” says G Chokkalingam , founder and managing director at Equinomics Research .

Meanwhile , market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) on <TIMEX3 tid="t1163" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> halved position limits for certain stock futures , restricted short - selling of index derivatives and raised margin rates for some shares in a bid to curb volatility .
That apart , market - wide position limit ( MWPL ) has also been halved for highly volatile stocks — those that see an average daily variation of 15 per cent during the week .

The banking system is not running a liquidity deficit .
There is , in fact , Rs 2.93 trillion of surplus liquidity in the system , shows the RBI data .
But bond yields have risen as foreign investors liquidated their holdings in search of safe haven .
The bond market , in such cases , would need to depend on domestic investors who may want liquidity support to invest in bonds , say bond dealers .
Besides , RBI ’s expressed liquidity operations also help boost the morale as the market gets a signal that the central bank is there to take care of any need , should there be any market disruption because of the coronavirus pandemic , they said .

YES Bank crisis: Court sends Rana Kapoor to judicial custody till <TIMEX3 tid="t1190" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1194" type="TIME" value="2020-03-20T13:34:40">2020-03-20 13:34:40</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The session ’s court in Mumbai on <TIMEX3 tid="t1197" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> sent Rana Kapoor , former managing director ( MD ) and chief executive officer ( CEO ) of YES Bank , to judicial custody till <TIMEX3 tid="t1196" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> .
This came after the ( ED ) submitted before the court that it does not need Kapoor ’s custody any further .
The Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) has also moved a production warrant to take Kapoor into custody .
The CBI had filed a case against Kapoor for allegedly obtaining illegal gratification by acquiring a property in New Delhi from Gautam Thapar ’s Avantha group .
In exchange , waived the industrial house ’s dues and advanced new loans .
Earlier , Kapoor ’s ED custody was extended by <TIMEX3 tid="t1200" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1199" type="DATE" value="2020-03-20">March 20</TIMEX3> while the ED had asked for a six - day custody .
The former banker was arrested on <TIMEX3 tid="t1202" type="DATE" value="2020-03-08">March 8</TIMEX3> by the ED under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) and was since in the probe agency ’s custody .
Kapoor told the court on <TIMEX3 tid="t1203" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> that he is suffering from asthma , and because of his age , he is vulnerable to coronavirus .
The court has asked the jail authorities to take appropriate precautions on this count .
Meanwhile , a number of high profile corporate promoters were summoned by the investigative agency , including Anil Ambani , Naresh Goyal , Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan , Subash Chandra and Sameer Gehlaut in connection with the case .
Anil Ambani was questioned by the ED on <TIMEX3 tid="t1204" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> and asked to furnish some important details which are crucial for the case , said an ED official .
Ambani ’s Reliance group is among the largest borrowers of the bank , with an exposure of around Rs 13,000 crore .
Ambani sought more time from the agency to provide further clarifications on some specific queries .
The probe agency has asked him to appear again on <TIMEX3 tid="t1206" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">March 30</TIMEX3> .
Other big defaulters of YES Bank , who had been summoned by the ED to appear <TIMEX3 tid="t1207" type="DATE" value="2020-W14">this week</TIMEX3> , did not show up .
During investigations , the probe agency found that a loan of Rs 202 crore was sanctioned to Mack Star Marketing , which is a joint venture among HDIL promoters Sarang Wadhawan & Rakesh Wadhawan , former Punjab and Maharashtra Co - operative ( PMC ) Bank chairman Waryam Singh and the De Shaw group .
The first three hold only 16.64 per cent shares in the entity while the De Shaw group holds majority stake .
The ED found that the loan of Rs 202 crore , sanctioned to Mack Star Marketing , was used by HDIL to pay off its previous loans .
The loan was sanctioned to the entity with the specific purpose of renovating its office building .
Further investigations have revealed that about 78 companies owned by Kapoor ’s family members were being controlled and managed by Kapoor himself .
The ED has also found that had bought debentures of Dewan Housing ( DHFL ) worth Rs 3,700 crore while the latter gave a loan to a company owned by Kapoor ’s daughters for Rs 600 crore .
Both the transactions were suspicious as the company owned by Kapoor ’s daughters did not have sufficient businesses or assets .
Also , the mortgage shown for the loan was only a property worth around Rs 40 crore .
The property mortgaged was an agricultural land shown as residential land with its worth inflated .

Pharmaceutical industry expects coronavirus vaccine in <TIMEX3 tid="t1211" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t1210" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18 months</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1215" type="TIME" value="2020-03-19T22:06:11">2020-03-19 22:06:11</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The expects it will take <TIMEX3 tid="t1219" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1218" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18 months</TIMEX3> to roll out a vaccine , executives said <TIMEX3 tid="t1216" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> , as they jointly pledged to make it available worldwide based on need .
Bureaucracy could be slashed to speed up the process -- but the time needed for safety testing could not be compromised , industry chiefs and the Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations told a virtual press conference hosted in Geneva .
" We 're confident technology will arrest this disease , " said IFPMA president David Ricks , the chairman of Eli Lilly and Company .
The global death toll has risen to over 9,000 with more than 217,000 confirmed infections , according to an AFP tally based on official sources .
" When you think about how many people we will want to vaccinate -- once we have a vaccine -- around the world , we 're talking billions , and that 's a huge challenge , " said David Loew , the executive vice president of Sanofi Pasteur .
" We need to ensure the safety .
It 's going to take <TIMEX3 tid="t1222" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1221" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18 months</TIMEX3> until you have a registered vaccine on the market . "
Rajeev Venkayya , president of the Global Vaccines Business Unit at Takeda Pharmaceuticals , said that timeline was " very aggressive
but we think it might be feasible " .
Dozens of clinical trials for vaccines and treatments are under way around the world after the virus 's genome was shared by China , where COVID-19 first broke out in <TIMEX3 tid="t1223" type="DATE" value="2019-12">December</TIMEX3> .
But industry chiefs said they could not lower the testing standards to get a preventative vaccine on the market more quickly .
" You 're injecting this into healthy people , so you do n't want to have suddenly people getting sick because you are short - cutting , " said Loew .
" It could also have deleterious effects on other vaccines , if people lose trust in vaccination , " he added .
" The regulatory authorities are cutting red tape , and that 's the way we can accelerate getting to the market quicker . "
Venkayya added that some , if not most of the testing programmes being run , would fail to produce a viable vaccine .
However , the value of running multiple trials simultaneously was that " some will succeed and get across the finish line " , he said .
Venkayya said the industry would " prioritise access and equity in the distribution " of any effective vaccine .
Paul Stoffels , chief scientific officer at Johnson and Johnson , said the industry would make sure that any vaccine , wherever it is produced , " will be available " to everyone " who needs it " across the globe .
" That 's a promise for what we are doing jointly as an industry , " he stressed .
Stoffels said the problem in reaching solutions was that the virus had new characteristics compared to outbreaks such as SARS .
" This virus is extremely transmittable -- and that 's what is so new .
So it 's a new virus which needs new tools , and that 's where we have to start from scratch on the research . "
Meanwhile Ricks said money was not the issue for pharmaceutical giants in finding solutions .
" This is not a capital resource problem <TIMEX3 tid="t1224" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , more of a human resource problem , " he said .
Ricks said nobody in the industry was talking about how to take the credit and make money out of vaccines and treatments , while public - private partnerships could help share any financial risks .
IFPMA director - general Thomas Cueni said the industry was putting on an unprecedented united front to conquer the virus .
" We wo n't rest until we find the solution , " he said .

Coronavirus spread: Banks' exposure to travel, hospitality sectors at risk .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1228" type="TIME" value="2020-03-19T20:38:06">2020-03-19 20:38:06</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Lenders ’ exposure to the travel and hospitality sectors is at risk because of the economic disruption from the novel ( COVID-19 ) .
The 65 listed companies in the sector had combined outstanding loans worth around Rs 30,500 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1231" type="DATE" value="2019-09" mod="END">the end of September 2019</TIMEX3> , up 37.2 per cent year - on - year ( YoY ) compared to the corresponding period <TIMEX3 tid="t1234" type="DATE" value="2018-09">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
The companies had total loan outstanding of around Rs 22,200 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1240" type="DATE" value="2018-09" mod="END">the end of September 2018</TIMEX3> .
Hotels are the biggest borrowers followed by airlines .
Hotel chains such as Indian Hotels , Chalet Hotels , Lemon Tree Hotels , and Asian Hotels ( North ) accounted for around 50 per cent of the combined borrowings of firms that Business Standard analysed .
( See the adjoining chart )
The analysis excluded unlisted large borrowers such as Air India and defunct companies such as Jet Airways , Cox & Kings and Kingfisher Airlines .
Among individual companies , SpiceJet was the most indebted in the industry .
The airline had total outstanding debt of around Rs 8,800 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1245" type="DATE" value="2019-09" mod="END">the end of September 2019</TIMEX3> , against Rs 1,217 crore <TIMEX3 tid="t1248" type="DATE" value="2018-09">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
It was followed by Coffee Day Enterprises , which had debt worth Rs 6,500 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1254" type="DATE" value="2019-09" mod="END">the end of September 2019</TIMEX3> , up from Rs 4,410 crore <TIMEX3 tid="t1257" type="DATE" value="2018-09">a year ago</TIMEX3> ; Indian Hotels ( Rs 3,500 crore ) ; and , Mahindra Holidays ( Rs 1,770 crore ) .
Airlines are facing the brunt of the disruption caused by COVID-19 as countries restrict air travel and travelers themselves cancel holiday plans .
A prolonged decline in air travel is likely to hit SpiceJet ’s finances , given its highly leveraged balance sheet .
Its debt of around Rs 8,800 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1263" type="DATE" value="2019-09" mod="END">the end of September 2019</TIMEX3> was backed by a negative net worth of Rs 461 crore , putting the airline and its lender in a financially vulnerable position .
In comparison , market leader Interglobe Aviation that runs IndiGo had total outstanding debt of around Rs 622 crore at the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t1266" type="DATE" value="2020-H1">first half</TIMEX3> of financial year <TIMEX3 tid="t1267" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t1268" type="DATE" value="2020">20</TIMEX3> ( H1FY20 ) , backed by net worth of around Rs 6,200 crore .
This gives it a greater resilience to survive the downturn .
In the hospitality or hotel industry , smaller chains such as Lemon Tree Hotels , Asian Hotels ( North ) , and Asian Hotels ( West ) look more vulnerable to a downturn than their larger peers such as Indian Hotels , EIH and Chalet Hotels .
In the first <TIMEX3 tid="t1269" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine months</TIMEX3> of FY20 ( 9MFY20 ) , these smaller hotels chains had much lower interest coverage ratio ( ICR ) — a measure of the company ’s debt servicing ability — than larger and well established chains .
For example , Lemon Tree Hotels , which reported total borrowings of Rs 1,285 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1272" type="DATE" value="2019-09" mod="END">the end of September 2019</TIMEX3> has ICR of 1.6x compared to 3.3x for Indian Hotels and 6.5x for EIH .
Similarly , Asian Hotels ( North ) reported ICR of 0.6x , which was close to a default , while Asian Hotels ( West ) had ICR of 1.5x during 9MFY20 .
A company with ICR below 1.5x is treated by rating agencies as being close to default .
Coffee Day Enterprises could also face financial difficulty .
The café chain operator reported total debt of around Rs 6,500 crore at <TIMEX3 tid="t1277" type="DATE" value="2019-03" mod="END">the end of March 2019</TIMEX3> , backed by net worth of around Rs 2,530 crore .
This translated into an uncomfortably high debt to equity ratio of 2.6x at <TIMEX3 tid="t1282" type="DATE" value="2019-03" mod="END">the end of March 2019</TIMEX3> .

Coronavirus outbreak: Start-up entrepreneurs call for lockdown across India .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1288" type="TIME" value="2020-03-17T17:39:12">2020-03-17 17:39:12</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
As the country grapples with rising cases , start - up have come up with an action plan requesting the government to impose Section 144 in major cities across the country for <TIMEX3 tid="t1290" type="DURATION" value="P14D">14 days</TIMEX3> in order to avoid a Wuhan - like situation in the country .
The plan has been signed by over 50 start - up including RedBus founder Phanindra Sama , Cred CEO Kunal Shah , Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl and Bounce founders Vivekananda Hallekere , Varun Agni , and Anil G among others .
“ <TIMEX3 tid="t1292" type="DURATION" value="P2W">The next two weeks</TIMEX3> are very crucial and we are helping the government with data points to take quick action , ” said Hallekere , chief executive of bike sharing platform Bounce .
“ We are also ensuring that the infrastructure for isolation is managed — be it converting a hotel into an isolation centre or getting delivery companies to ramp up supply chain during the lockdown , ” he added .
Gaurav Munjal of Unacademy , Abhishek Bansal of Shadowfax , and Urban Company founder too have endorsed the note .
It has also been signed by several venture capitalists such as Kalaari Capital ’s Chirag Gandhi and Accel Partners ’ Prashanth Prakash .
The group claims that India could have between 600 - 2,500 positive cases as compared to the <TIMEX3 tid="t1293" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> 137 reported in the country as learnings from Wuhan suggest actual undiagnosed cases are typically 5 - 20 times the diagnosed cases .
It also points out that countries which have acted early and strongly such as South Korea , Singapore , and Japan have been able to bring down cases compared to those which waited and watched such as Iran , Italy and France .
“ Hence , while containment efforts should continue , imposing a lock - down and Section 144 <TIMEX3 tid="t1295" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> versus <TIMEX3 tid="t1294" type="DATE" value="2020-04-16">30 days later</TIMEX3> might reduce deaths by 5 times , ” says the note .
It suggests that from <TIMEX3 tid="t1300" type="DATE" value="2021-03-20">March 20</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1301" type="DATE" value="2020-04-12">April 12</TIMEX3> there should be Section 144 across all major affected areas , businesses should work from home , and stores , schools , cinemas all should be shut down and public transport should run on a limited need basis .
In the second stage , between <TIMEX3 tid="t1304" type="DATE" value="2020-04-13">April 13</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t1305" type="DATE" value="2020-05-17">May 17</TIMEX3> , the government should reassess the situation and lift off Section 144 in most if not all places .
It should continue to selectively keep schools , colleges , temples and places of large gathering closed .
In stage 3 , between <TIMEX3 tid="t1309" type="DATE" value="2020-05-18">May 18</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t1310" type="DATE" value="2020-05-31">May 31</TIMEX3> a decision should be made to have another round of lockdown , so that there is no second peak after initial restrictions From <TIMEX3 tid="t1308" type="DATE" value="2020-06">June</TIMEX3> onwards , government should open up everything with social distancing but monitor the situation It urges the government to maintain a supply chain of essentials such as medicines , food and healthcare access during the lockdown period and create war rooms headed by the chief minister of each state .
The group also advises scaling up of testing infrastructure by opening it to the private sector .

Coronavirus outbreak: Uncertainty looms large over steel's <TIMEX3 tid="t1406" type="DATE" value="2020-04">April</TIMEX3> price hike .

that had increased <TIMEX3 tid="t1411" type="DATE" value="2020-04">this month</TIMEX3> are still holding ground in spite of the outbreak which has put the global economy on the edge .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1412" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> , companies had increased prices across - the - board by Rs 500 - 800 a tonne , the fourth in a row , taking the hot rolled coil ( HRC ) price to Rs 37,000 a tonne .
However , companies are not sure whether an increase in <TIMEX3 tid="t1413" type="DATE" value="2020-04">April</TIMEX3> will be possible in the wake of the virus outbreak .
M C Agrawal , executive director ( sales & ITD ) , Steel Authority of India Limited ( SAIL ) ,
said the price increase in <TIMEX3 tid="t1414" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> was holding .
" There is no change in demand which is already recovering .
Auto has also started picking up . "
" Whether an increase in price will happen in <TIMEX3 tid="t1415" type="DATE" value="2020-04">April</TIMEX3> is difficult to say , " he added .
But he sounded confident about a recovery in demand for steel .
" There is a fear factor <TIMEX3 tid="t1416" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> because of coronavirus , but things will settle .
At best , the pick - up could be delayed by <TIMEX3 tid="t1418" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> or two , " he said .
For the time being there could be some ups and downs due to coronavirus , said Hervinder Singh , president- mining & international projects , Jindal Steel & Power Limited ( JSPL ) .
" Prices are holding for <TIMEX3 tid="t1419" type="DATE" value="2020-04">this month</TIMEX3> , " he added .
" The India story is very positive , and at JSPL , we have crossed all records in production , " Singh said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1422" type="DATE" value="2020-Q1">The last quarter</TIMEX3> was the best so far , and <TIMEX3 tid="t1423" type="DATE" value="2020-Q2">this quarter</TIMEX3> ending in <TIMEX3 tid="t1421" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> will be even better , " he added .

The steel sector has been gradually recovering from lows since <TIMEX3 tid="t1426" type="DATE" value="2019-11">November</TIMEX3> .

However , primary and secondary producers are unsure how the virus outbreak would play out in <TIMEX3 tid="t1429" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the next few weeks</TIMEX3> .
The secondary producers said that the sentiments had hugely been impacted by the outbreak .
" There is no visibility on where things are headed <TIMEX3 tid="t1430" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , " said a secondary producer .
ICRA , in a <TIMEX3 tid="t1431" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> report on the sector , said that prices were expected to come under pressure in the near term as an aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak .
The price rise in India was in line with the global trend .
Chinese export HRC prices had increased from $ 428 a tonne end - <TIMEX3 tid="t1433" type="DATE" value="2019-10">October</TIMEX3> to $ 496 a tonne in <TIMEX3 tid="t1435" type="DATE" value="2020-01">January 2020</TIMEX3> , ICRA noted .
However , since mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t1438" type="DATE" value="2020-01">January</TIMEX3> , due to a slowdown in China 's steel consumption , following outbreak , prices had witnessed a six per cent fall .
But producers pointed out that the situation in China had <TIMEX3 tid="t1441" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been contained and shipments were moving out while that in Europe was spiralling out of control .
For the steel producers , though China is not a major market , it is a source for consumables and spares .
A major steel producer said that <TIMEX3 tid="t1442" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> there was no threat to business continuity .
The domestic were <TIMEX3 tid="t1443" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> trading at a discount of seven per cent to landed cost from China and at a discount of three per cent to landed cost from Japan , said ICRA .
" While this provides a headroom to domestic steelmakers to increase steel prices , rising number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in India remains a concern , and the same along with continuing macroeconomic headwinds , could affect domestic steel consumption and pressurise steel prices in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1444" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> , " it said .
Consequently , ICRA expects the domestic steel consumption growth to remain between four and five per cent in FY2021 as against the <TIMEX3 tid="t1448" type="DATE" value="2019-11">November 2019</TIMEX3> forecast of 6.5 per cent .

With international investors finding immunity in gold against the coronavirus , the price of the metal in the international market is marching towards another multi - year high and looking at $ 1,700 in the near term .
This despite the sharp reversal <TIMEX3 tid="t1455" type="DATE" value="2020-W13">last week</TIMEX3> and the subsequent claw - back .

11,000 is the last ray of hope for bulls: Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking .

Terrible week for financial markets , 11,000 last ray of hope
It ’s been <TIMEX3 tid="t1483" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> of distress , intimidation and a lot of uncertainties for all equity across the globe .
Until <TIMEX3 tid="t1484" type="DATE" value="2020-W13">last week</TIMEX3> , probably no one had sensed how massive the overall adverse effect of Coronavirus would be .
The moment it started spreading rapidly outside China , things became worse and this eventually resulted into a complete meltdown in global For us , we saw some hope of revival on <TIMEX3 tid="t1485" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> but <TIMEX3 tid="t1486" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> ’s huge gap down followed by sustained selling poured water on it .
Eventually , we concluded by registering the biggest weekly cut after <TIMEX3 tid="t1487" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
There was no respect shown for any major support as we saw breaching of crucial points one after another .
Honestly speaking , no analysis works in such kind of fearsome environment .
Although , the next path of action is solely dependent on further developments with respect to coronavirus ; but still , let us see where we stand <TIMEX3 tid="t1488" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and what are the next key levels to watch .
At present , we are placed precisely at the 161 per cent retracement of the <TIMEX3 tid="t1489" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> up move from 11,614.50 to 12,246.70 .
In case if the Nifty slides further , then the last ray of hope would be the lower end of multi - year ‘ Upward Sloping Channel ’ placed at 11,000 .
On the upside , <TIMEX3 tid="t1490" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> ’s huge gap area of 11,384.80 – 11,536.70 remains to be an immediate hurdle .
In our sense , if any sustainable recovery has to happen <TIMEX3 tid="t1491" type="DATE" value="2020-W14">this week</TIMEX3> , it should be V - shaped or steep in nature .
If that does n’t happen and if the recovery is gradual , that would be an ominous sign for the bulls .
Momentum traders are advised to stay light and should avoid leveraged positions in such kind of global uncertainty .
But having said that , historically it ’s been proven that such panics generally offer very good opportunity for investors who are willing to build their portfolio .
Hence , one should start nibbling into quality propositions .

Slowing of growth has had a definite impact on the Centre ’s revenues , but revenue spending , most of which is salaries , and interest payments , has grown massively ( chart 6 ) .
Capital expenditure has grown slower over years .

After Infosys, <TIMEX3 tid="t1570" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Wipro hires a Capgemini top executive as CEO & MD .

A French national , he would be based out of Paris .
also said that since Neemuchwala would leave the company from <TIMEX3 tid="t1585" type="DATE" value="2020-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> , its chairman Rishad Premji would oversee the daily operations of the firm during this interim period .
During his twenty - <TIMEX3 tid="t1586" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five year</TIMEX3> career with Capgemini , Delaporte held several leadership roles including that of chief executive officer of the global financial services strategic business unit , and head of all global service lines .
His experience in overseeing Capgemini ’s India operations- one of the largest delivery centres of the company- is likely to put him in good stead in managing the operations of Wipro .
He has a bachelor ’s degree in economy and finance from Sciences Po Paris and a Masters in Law from Sorbonne University .
“ I am delighted to welcome Thierry as CEO and Managing Director of the company .
Thierry has an exceptional leadership track record , strong international exposure , deep strategic expertise , a unique ability to forge long - standing client relationships , and proven experience of driving transformation and managing technological disruption .
We believe that Thierry is the right person to lead Wipro in its next phase of growth , ” said Rishad Premji , Chairman at
Wipro Ltd.
“ I want to thank Abid for all that he has done for Wipro and for making this transition as smooth and seamless as possible despite his personal commitments . ”
The appointment has come at a time when Wipro continues to lag its peers in driving top line growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t1587" type="DATE" value="2019">the past years</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1588" type="DATE" value="2019">the past years</TIMEX3> , Wipro has taken many steps to realign its business operations for driving faster growth under the incumbent CEO like .
While the West Asia business of the IT services firm has been restructured , Indian business has also been reorganised by carving out a separate unit for state - run public sector undertakings and government organisations from enterprise business .
The IT services firm has also divested its low margin data centre business as part of its portfolio restructuring initiatives .
Despite all these measures , Wipro posted 1.7 per cent growth in its revenues from IT segment at $ 8.256 billion in the last financial year .
So , the appointment is critical for the IT services firm to accelerate its revenue growth at a time when the industry is staring at a dip in demand owing to ongoing Covid-19 crisis .
Meanwhile , Wipro also announced the appointment of Deepak M Satwalekar , a financial services professional and former MD of HDFC Ltd , to its board of directors for <TIMEX3 tid="t1593" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> effective <TIMEX3 tid="t1591" type="DATE" value="2020-07-01">July 1 , 2020</TIMEX3> .

India's cement production to <TIMEX3 tid="t1595" type="DATE" value="2025-FA">fall 25</TIMEX3>-30% in FY21 as Covid-19 saps demand .

in the country is slated to fall by 25 - 30 per cent this fiscal as Covid pandemic has sucked demand from end user industries .
This is billed as the steepest fall for the industry in any year .
Capacity utilisation in FY21 is seen at 40 - 45 per cent .
Even before the onset of Covid-19 , cement producers were wrestling with an economic slump .
In the last fiscal , cement output fell by 0.8 per cent as against a growth of 13.3 per cent registered in FY19 .
“ The was already impacted by the general economic slowdown prevalent in the economy and <TIMEX3 tid="t1605" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with the Covid-19 pandemic prevalent , it has further added on to the weakness present in the industry even though the macros seem strong in the long term .
is usually closely in - line with demand which is also poised to fall sharply given the related restrictions present as the virus is showing no signs of abating .
The nationwide has come at the time when construction activities is at its peak and it will be followed by the monsoon season where again the construction activity will be impacted thereby affecting entire dynamics of demand - supply for cement ” , said a report from CARE Ratings .
After easing of curbs , cement manufacturers have resumed operations .
However , due to limited manpower availability and logistics constraints , the plants are running at depleted capacity .
Logistics and transportation continue to be a stumbling block as priority of Railways is on transporting essential goods .
Due to bleak outlook and unfavourable business conditions , cement companies are unlikely to make fresh additions to existing Capex ( Capital expenditure ) as demand stays muted .
Besides , some of the players are likely to defer Capex spends .
Flagging demand in the domestic market has unnerved cement makers as India is the world ’s second - largest cement market , both in production and consumption .
“ Weakness in housing demand , prolonged rains in many parts of the country and decline in demand from the infrastructure segment due to lack of funding and halting / temporary stoppage of state projects following change in government post state elections has had a negative bearing on the production of cement in the domestic markets .
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Indian sub - continent which forced the government to announce a nationwide lockdown from <TIMEX3 tid="t1609" type="DATE" value="2021-03-25">March 25</TIMEX3> onwards also affected the domestic during FY20 .
Construction activity across the country was halted , which is normally at its peak in the month of <TIMEX3 tid="t1610" type="DATE" value="2021-03">March</TIMEX3> , affected the cement offtake .
Production fell by 24.7 per cent during <TIMEX3 tid="t1615" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March 2020</TIMEX3> as compared with the 15.7 per cent growth achieved during <TIMEX3 tid="t1616" type="DATE" value="2019-03">March 2019</TIMEX3> ” , the report added .
As per the Cement Manufacturers Association , India accounts for eight per cent of the world ’s installed capacity .
The nameplate capacity of cement manufacturers has increased at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate ( CAGR ) of 7.1 per cent during FY16 - FY20 .
Manufacturers maintained a capacity utilisation rate of 65 - 70 per cent between FY15 and FY19 .
But prolonged rains and government - enforced nationwide lockdown shrunk the capacity utilisation rate from 70 per cent in FY19 to 61 per cent in FY20 .

One RE will give an investor the option to subscribe to one RIL share in the rights issue , which too opened simultaneously on <TIMEX3 tid="t1622" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .

The difference between the <TIMEX3 tid="t1629" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> price and price is Rs 180.4 , or 14.35 per cent .
Technically , the cost of acquisition for one share for those buying REs in the secondary market works out to Rs 1,469 ( Rs 1,257 plus RE price of Rs 212 ) .
Market players said the premium of Rs 32 was to factor in interests cost .
“ Investors have to pay only a fourth of the amount <TIMEX3 tid="t1630" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
The remaining 75 per cent over next <TIMEX3 tid="t1632" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18 months</TIMEX3> .
Purely by adding interest cost of 9 per cent for an 18 - month period , those buying RE at <TIMEX3 tid="t1633" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> price still stand a chance to make money .
The underlying assumption , however , is that you are bullish on the prospects of RIL , ” said SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com , an investment advisory firm .
RIL rights issue is carried out in three trances .
At first shareholders have to pay 25 per cent of the issue price ( Rs 314.25 ) , another 25 per cent ( Rs 314.25 ) in <TIMEX3 tid="t1639" type="DATE" value="2021-05">May next year</TIMEX3> and the remaining 50 per cent ( Rs 628.5 ) in <TIMEX3 tid="t1638" type="DATE" value="2021-11">November 2021</TIMEX3> .
Those participating in the rights issue will have to make these staggered payments irrespective of where RIL shares trade in the secondary market .

At a time when the economy is likely to see a severe contraction , we continue to apply band - aid .
There was hope after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a Rs 20 - trillion package , roughly translating into 10 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product .
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's Rs 21 trillion largesse does n’t translate into more cash - in - hand for most .
For example , the Rs 3 - trillion central government guaranteed credit line for micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSME ) sounds great .
After all , there will be a moratorium of <TIMEX3 tid="t1645" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> .

<TIMEX3 tid="t1649" type="DATE" value="2019-09">Last September</TIMEX3> , the government gave hefty tax sops to India Inc.
Result : Due to the reduction in tax liabilities , the price - to - earnings ratio improved .
The markets cheered for <TIMEX3 tid="t1650" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> .
But as days went by , there was a clear realisation that no fresh investments will happen because there was no demand .
At the same time , non - banking financial companies went into deeper stress as people stopped borrowing and there was a general fear about lending money to these firms .
When the skeletons came out of the cupboards , the realisation dawned that many of these were riding tigers .
For example , the <TIMEX3 tid="t1651" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> interest liability of a non - banking financial company was Rs 1,500 crore on a loan book of around Rs 1 lakh crore .
This NBFC was clearly raising money at an unaffordable rate during a falling interest rate regime .
Then , Covid-19 happened .
And the lockdown began .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1652" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , after <TIMEX3 tid="t1654" type="DURATION" value="P50D">50 days</TIMEX3> of the lockdown , a grand stimulus package has been announced .
But it again focusses mostly on the supply side , and reforms that will give results in months or years later .
Meanwhile , demand has suffered badly .
Most companies , barring an odd Asian Paints , have announced salary or job cuts … some of them severe ones .
Even the central and state governments have cut salaries so one can not blame the private sector only .
So , in terms of income , an upper middle class family will most likely going to be downgraded to middle class , middle class to lower middle class and so on .
So car companies can make cars , builders may build houses , banks may lower interest rates , malls may open and there could be grand discounts at the best hotels , but few would be able to or interested in spending on such luxuries .
The ones who do are n’t dependent on salaries but dividend incomes .
Instead , there will be downtrading .
A Pears soap user may go for Lux .
And a Lux user may seek comfort in Lifebuoy .
Managing such times is an ‘ out of syllabus exercise ’ for any government .
But this could be a good time for free lunches and tax holidays .
A one - year tax income holiday for everyone or up to a certain salary level is likely to ensure that people do n’t down trade or defer basic expenses .
Yes , a car or home buying may not happen immediately , but even being able to maintain the existing lifestyle will help growth and India Inc.
Few would want a loan <TIMEX3 tid="t1671" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> , but most need a free lunch .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t1674" type="DATE" value="199">the nineties</TIMEX3> , successive governments have sold the ‘ middle - class spending power ’ dream to attract investments from global companies .
It ’s time to protect it .

No saliva to DRS: Cricket will see these key changes in post-Covid-19 world .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1678" type="TIME" value="2020-05-19T10:16:50">2020-05-19 10:16:50</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Cricket is set to do away with one of its oldest practices -- the use of saliva to polish the ball – as ( ICC ) is gearing up to resume the operations amid ( Covid-19 ) pandemic .
The ICC cricket committee led by has recommended some changes in the existing rules .
The recommendation included banning the use of saliva , no neutral umpires and increase the use of Decision Review System ( DRS ) .
However , the ICC Cricket Committee saw no health hazard in continuing with the use of sweat .
So , how the cricket as we know it is going to be changed in post - Covid-19 world : The use of saliva to polish the ball has been a significant method used from <TIMEX3 tid="t1680" type="DATE" value="199" mod="START">early 90s</TIMEX3> , which help the bowler to reverse swing the ball after it gets old .
If ICC accepts the recommendation on use of saliva , then it would be very hard for the bowler to get the swing .
This will make the batsman more dominant .
But the committee advocated the use of bowler - friendly pitches to balance the gap .
The headed committee , though , allowed the use of sweat to shine .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1681" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3> , Australian manufacturer Kookaburra has also said that it will ready a wax applicator as an alternative to saliva and sweat to help bowlers shine cricket balls in the post Covid-19 world .
"Kookaburra 's research and development centre in Australia has been working on a product to replace the traditional methods of polishing a ball that could be controlled and managed by the match umpire .
We have developed a unique wax formula for polishing a cricket ball , " Brett Elliott , group managing director of the brand , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t1683" type="DATE" value="2019-05-05">May 5</TIMEX3>."The pocket size sponge applicator would enable umpires or players to apply a thin layer of wax which could then be rubbed and polished in a traditional manner to enhance the shine on the ball , " Kookaburra ’s MD said .
According to cricket website ESPNcricinfo , the cricket committee has discussed the use of artificial substance for shinning the ball .
But , it felt that the use of any artificial substance on the ball is termed as ball - tampering under the existing law .
The Kumble - led committee felt bending the rule at present would lead to complications .
The committee also suggested the re - introduction of two non - neutral umpires in bilateral series at least till the time travelling becomes safer .
"Given the challenges of international travel with borders being closed , limited commercial flights and mandatory quarantine periods , the Committee recommended that local match officials be appointed in the short - term , " the governing body stated in its release .
The concept of having two neutral umpires officiating in matches came in <TIMEX3 tid="t1684" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t1685" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t1686" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , it involved one local and one neutral umpire .
The committee said that the appointments will continue to be made via the ICC from local Elite and International Panel referees and umpires .
Where there are no Elite Panel match officials in the country , the best local International Panel match officials will be appointed .
This effectively means that Anil Chaudhary , Shamshuddin and Nitin Menon can officiate in Test matches in India .
However , the neutral umpires have been brought in the Test matches so that it would not favour the home team .
The cricket committee also addressed this problem by suggesting the use of technology .
In case non - neutral umpires are introduced , then teams may get an additional review ( <TIMEX3 tid="t1688" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> two per innings)."The Committee also recommended that the use of technology is increased to support the appointments of a wider pool of umpires from around the world and has proposed an additional review per team per innings is introduced in each format as an interim measure .

The IBA has further sought relaxation in the RBI ’s <TIMEX3 tid="t2069" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> directive to banks , asking them to make additional provisioning of 10 per cent on their books for all moratorium loans .
The RBI has allowed a three - month moratorium on all term loans , including agriculture , retail and crop loans , along with credit cards and working capital payments , as long as the account did n’t turn into an NPA before <TIMEX3 tid="t2071" type="DATE" value="2020-03-01">March 1</TIMEX3> .

However , the dispensation may be availed of only by SFBs due for listing in <TIMEX3 tid="t2095" type="DURATION" value="P5Q">the next five quarters</TIMEX3> .
“ This dispensation may only be a one - time leeway as listing requirements according to licensing norms are unlikely to be modified , ” said a source .
The banking regulator mandates that SFBs must get listed within <TIMEX3 tid="t2100" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> of their net worth reaching Rs 500 crore .
SFBs with a net worth below that can also get listed voluntarily .

It filed the draft red herring prospectus ( DRHP ) in <TIMEX3 tid="t2114" type="DATE" value="2019-12">December 2019</TIMEX3> .
Given the present situation , industry sources say it would be very challenging for SFBs to hit the market in the near future .
“ Our business had almost come to a standstill for <TIMEX3 tid="t2116" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> and we have just started focusing on restoring normal operations , ” said the chief executive officer of an SFB who did not want to be named .

rivals have taken its aircraft and routes , but employees and creditors continue to wait for their dues <TIMEX3 tid="t2199" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> after the airline 's closure .
The airline operated its last flight between Amritsar - Mumbai on <TIMEX3 tid="t2202" type="DATE" value="2020-04-17">April 17</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2201" type="DATE" value="2019">last year</TIMEX3> as lenders turned down its demand for an emergency funding .
The Naresh Goyal - founded airline , among the first private carriers to take to the skies in <TIMEX3 tid="t2203" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> , collapsed under a mountain of debt and a cash crunch .
It is under insolvency since <TIMEX3 tid="t2205" type="DATE" value="2019-06">last June</TIMEX3> with admitted claims to the tune of Rs 16,000 crore .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2206" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , the Covid-19 crisis has dashed it 's revival prospects .
Before the nationwide lockdown , the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) granted an additional <TIMEX3 tid="t2207" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> to the airline 's resolution professional to find a suitor on the grounds that lenders would get better value for their assets if these were sold via a formal resolution plan , instead of the liquidation route .
Till <TIMEX3 tid="t2208" type="DATE" value="2020-03">last month</TIMEX3> , the Russian Development Fund and Prudent ARC were in the fray to revive the airline , but did not submit a concrete plan .
“ In view of the order passed by the NCLAT in suo moto appeal , the period during which there is a lockdown will be excluded while calculating the period of resolution process , ” , said Ashish Pyasi Associate Partner Dhir and Dhir Associates .
“ By giving extension , the NCLT gave additional life to the process so that viable resolution plan can be explored .
It is pertinent to note that the nature of assets is such that in liquidation these assets may not fetch the same value and may become obsolete .
Therefore , for maximisation of asset value it is important that some viable resolution plan is explored , ' Pyasi added .
However , bankers believe given the <TIMEX3 tid="t2215" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> situation , a revival for Jet looks very difficult .
" Overall aviation industry is in a crisis and airlines have cash flow problem .
Expecting a company to submit a revival plan for looks out of question .
Even realising good value from liquidation would be difficult as globally airlines are grounding planes , " said a bank executive .

While several pilots , engineers and cabin crew have found jobs in other airlines in India and abroad , about 4000 employees are still on the rolls of Jet Airways .
" It has been difficult for employees to sustain without a regular income .
Many have sold their ornaments or broken their fixed deposits to run household .
Some have even gone to the native places , " said Nidhi Chaphekar , Jet 's cabin manager turned motivational speaker .
Chaphekar and a few of her colleagues are still optimistic about Jet 's revival .
“ The Jet brand is still alive .
The aircraft have been preserved .
All we are hoping is that government support revival and pay us <TIMEX3 tid="t2217" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least one month</TIMEX3> salary , " she added .
“ I have exhausted all my savings and my sister is helping me pay my home loan EMIs .
In the absence of regular income I have been forced to put up my house in Mumbai for sale and move to Orissa with my children , " said Geetanjalee Parelkar , a Boeing 777 pilot in the airline .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t2220" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March 2020</TIMEX3> , more than 20,000 claims have been made totaling to over Rs 37,000 crore .

Working capacity at 25% may be unviable as industry awaits end of lockdown .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2227" type="TIME" value="2020-04-13T18:03:43">2020-04-13 18:03:43</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Amid concerns in some sectors , like auto , that a staggered opening up of manufacturing capacity to about 25 per cent could be unviable , broad swathes of the industry are readying strategies after the possible partial lifting of lockdown post <TIMEX3 tid="t2229" type="DATE" value="2020-04-14">April 14</TIMEX3> .
The department for promotion of industry and industrial trade ( DPIIT ) had written to the home ministry <TIMEX3 tid="t2230" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few days ago</TIMEX3> detailing out a path for staggered lifting of the lockdown in industry and extend it beyond just essential products .
It had recommended that big companies in textiles , automobiles and electronics could start production of up to 20 - 25 per cent capacity in one shift , to begin with .
All eyes are <TIMEX3 tid="t2232" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is expected to announce some relief for the industry on <TIMEX3 tid="t2233" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Auto component vendor Nippon Paint India said that at 25 per cent capacity , it will not even meet plant overhead costs , leave alone company overheads .
Sharad Malhotra , the company ’s president of automotive refinishes and wood coatings , said , “ For us to run a viable unit , we need to produce around 60 per cent , and even then , the margins are small .
However , once we are allowed to open , we will use it to complete some of our urgent export orders .
And , we hope we can move to 100 per cent in <TIMEX3 tid="t2234" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> . ”
A top executive of a leading passenger car company in north India also agreed that producing cars with such limitation would be a challenging .
Cement manufacturers like Shree Cement would prefer to wait and watch rather than rush in .
H M Bangur , managing director of Shree Cement , who prefers to wait for <TIMEX3 tid="t2236" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> before he takes a decision to open his plant , said , “ There are two issues – demand for cement is not there as construction is put on hold and all expenses of capex are getting deferred .
Secondly , there is a big issue on logistics . ”
Bangur added that workers are unwilling to come to the factory .
So , he will wait before taking a final call .
Mobile device manufacturers are in sync with the government plan for staggered production .
Hari Om Rai , director of Lava Mobiles , one of the leading Indian manufacturers , said , “ The 25 per cent utilisation of capacity is fine with us .
It will also help us in gauging the demand for mobile phones from consumers which I believe will also go up gradually . ”
So , instead of about 3,500 workers , Lava would initially run its factory with 600 - 700 staff , which is the minimum threshold required for production .

“ Stores in the UK , EU and the US have been asking exporters for samples , to give approvals and place orders .

The 25 per cent capacity limit is enough for us to address the samples and tackle fear psychosis , ” said Raja M Shanmugam , president of the Tirupur Exporters Association .
Thermax , for instance , has already restarted its chemical factories as they were supplying to essential services like FMCG but with one shift instead of the normal three .
M S Unnikrishnan , managing director of the company , said , “ For our equipment manufacturing units , which are in Gujarat , Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh , even if the lockdown is lifted , we will restart operations gradually .
We need to put in safety measures . ”
