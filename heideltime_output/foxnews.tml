Thomas Metzmacher had to get creative to keep his business open in Germany during the coronavirus pandemic .
After toying with the idea of a delivery service , he instead turned his half - timbered restaurant in Frankfurt into a makeshift drive - thru .
“ The restaurant had to close , nobody was allowed to sit inside anymore , so it was either give up or fight , ” he said .
“ I decided to fight . ”
Metzmacher was faced with the prospect of having to shut down his traditional German restaurant specializing in a traditional tart hard cider because of German regulations prohibiting groups of people from gathering amid the pandemic .

<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2019" mod="END">Late last year</TIMEX3> — long before most people had heard of the new coronavirus <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sweeping the globe — scientists in Germany jumped into action to develop a test for the virus that originated in China .
They had one by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2020-01">January</TIMEX3> — and labs around the country were ready to start using it just weeks later , around the same time that Europe ’s most populous country registered its first case .
“ It was clear that if the epidemic swept over here from China , then we had to start testing , ” said Hendrik Borucki , a spokesman for Bioscientia Healthcare , which has operated 19 labs in Germany .
That quick work stood in stark contrast to delays and missteps in some other countries .
“ The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses , ” said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten , whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin ’s Charité hospital — established <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1720" mod="MORE_THAN">over 300 years ago</TIMEX3> to treat plague victims .

Metzmacher ’s Zum Lahmen Esel restaurant , which has been in operation since <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1807">1807</TIMEX3> , meanwhile , normally would seat 200 people inside and another 200 in an outdoor garden .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , cars have driven up to a small booth in front of the restaurant , where one of Metzmacher ’s 36 employees took each order before pushing a plastic tub down a makeshift slide to the car ’s window to take payment at a safe distance .
Driving ahead , customers would get their orders in another tub pushed to their window .
“ It ’s going great , ” Metzmacher said .
“ My regulars are supporting me , they ’re really happy I ’m open . ”
CORONAVIRUS : WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Without people sticking around for a few more of the signature ciders , profit margins have been low -- but Metzmacher said it ’s better than nothing .
“ At least we ’re carrying on and we ’re continuing to work , ” he said .

Former Vice President Joe Biden said that <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2020">this year</TIMEX3> ’s Democratic National Convention might need to be a virtual one due to the coronavirus pandemic .
Biden , the Democratic presidential front - runner , said that while hosting a convention is necessary , it might not be possible or wise to have thousands of people traveling to one place during the outbreak .
“ We ’re going to have to do a convention , ” Biden said during an interview on ABC ’s “ <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2020-W14">This Week</TIMEX3> . ”
“ We may have to do a virtual convention .
I know I think we should be thinking about that <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> . ”
He added : “ What we do between <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and then is going to dictate a lot of that as well . ”
TRUMP WARNS OF ROUGH WEEK AHEAD : ' THERE WILL BE DEATH '
The Democrats already announced <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2020-W13">last week</TIMEX3> that they are pushing back their convention from a <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2020-07-13">July 13</TIMEX3> start date to <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2020-08-17">August 17</TIMEX3> because of fears that the country will still be on lockdown from the coronavirus .
“ In our <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> climate of uncertainty , we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention , ” Joe Solmonese , CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee , said in a statement .
“ During this critical time , when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown , we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health care professionals and emergency responders . ”
Biden ’s comments <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> on ABC were not totally unexpected , as the former vice president has expressed his hesitancy about holding the convention in numerous interviews .
Biden said in an interview on MSNBC on <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="TIME" value="2020-03-31TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> that “ it ’s hard to envision ” thousands of Democratic convention delegates , officials , media and other spectators packed inside an arena <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2020-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> .
But Biden added that “ we ought to be able to do what we were able to do in the middle of the Civil War , all the way through to World War II : have Democratic and Republican conventions , and primaries , and elections , and still have public safety .
And we 're able to do both .
But the fact is that it may have to be different . "
Biden and his fellow candidate , Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont , have been forced by the pandemic to do virtual rallies and campaign events from their homes in Delaware and Vermont , respectively .

The coronavirus outbreak , which has spread globally , has forced most Americans to huddle in their homes in hopes of preventing the spread of the virus , which causes the deadly COVID-19 disease .
Those venturing outside are urged to practice social distancing – keeping a minimum of 6 feet apart – and all large gatherings have been scrapped .
The Democratic convention will <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be held the week before the Republican National Convention , which is scheduled to take place <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2020-08-24">Aug. 24</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2020-08-27">27</TIMEX3> in Charlotte , N.C.
Moving the Democratic convention to <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2020-08">August</TIMEX3> -- which was under consideration for weeks by top Democratic Party officials -- became easier to do after the International Olympic Committee <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2020-W13">last week</TIMEX3> postponed the <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2020-SU">Summer</TIMEX3> Games in Tokyo .

EXCLUSIVE - Multiple patients infected with coronavirus were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort from the Javits Center in New York by mistake , three U.S. officials tell Fox News .

The patients were transferred sometime <TIMEX3 tid="t121" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> , according to the officials .
At the time the patients were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort , the initial screening did not indicate they were positive , officials said .
The hospital ship is located on Pier 90 on Manhattan ’s west side and arrived in New York <TIMEX3 tid="t122" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The vessel has a “ couple dozen ” patients on board <TIMEX3 tid="t123" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , according to chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman .
Part of the protocol before receiving patients onboard Comfort is for a coronavirus test to be performed .
The swab test came back hours later , but not before the patients had spent a night onboard the vessel , which is only supposed to treat trauma patients , not Covid-19 positive patients .

The Covid-19 positive patients have already been delivered back to the Javits center <TIMEX3 tid="t125" type="TIME" value="2020-04-04TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> to continue their treatment , one official said .
The Javits Center has been transformed into a 3,000 bed makeshift hospital by the Army Corps of Engineers .
The officials called the risk to the hospital ship ’s crew “ low , ” because of the protocols were already in place .
“ We planned for this to happen , ” one official said .
Another official pointed out this was why the hospital ship did not want to fill all 1,000 beds on board too quickly because the risk of the virus coming on board is so great .
The Comfort crew is scrubbing the area where the patients were housed on board .
All U.S. Navy medical personnel were wearing complete PPE ( personal protective equipment ) , the officials added .
“ We have infectious disease specialists on board as well , ” another official said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t126" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> both hospital ships Comfort in New York and Mercy in Los Angeles do not take Covid-19 patients , but top Pentagon leaders are “ reassessing ” that policy , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Army Gen.

Sailor Brinkley is shutting down social media criticism that the model said she received after wearing a protective mask in public amid the novel coronavirus pandemic .
The 21 - year - old was out and about in Brooklyn on <TIMEX3 tid="t384" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> with her boyfriend Ben Sosne when the pair was photographed donning the highly coveted N95 personal protective facemask that many health care professionals have gone without during the COVID-19 outbreak , as confirmed cases pile up and hospitals continue to operate at full capacity .
Brinkley and Sosne were reportedly out picking up groceries when they were spotted with their masks on and afterward , the daughter of Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook put the angry backlash to bed once and for all .
CORONAVIRUS : WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
“ To everyone reaching out ( very angrily ) about me having a mask .
My mom is an artist and does projects that require her to wear a mask so she had a stash of them in her art studio , ” she explained on her Instagram Story , according to People magazine .
“ We did n’t buy them upon hearing about the spread of COVID-19 .
She kept one mask for each one of our family members and then donated the rest to local hospitals . ”
Brinkley said her mother is continuously working to “ find supplies and keep hospital workers safe as well , ” adding that the legendary model is also donating 30 percent of her brand ’s proceeds to the Direct Relief Foundation , an organization at the frontlines of providing hospitals with masks and other personal protective equipment .

Trump campaign blasts Jeff Sessions as 'delusional,' demands Senate campaign stop promoting ties to president .
<TIMEX3 tid="t389" type="TIME" value="2020-04-02T19:24:05">2020-04-02 19:24:05</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
President Trump ’s re - election campaign on <TIMEX3 tid="t390" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> blasted former Jeff Sessions as “ delusional ” and demanded that the former attorney general “ immediately stop ” promoting ties to the president in his primary campaign for the U.S. Senate in Alabama .
Trump campaign chief operation officer Michael Glassner , in a scathing letter to Sessions , slammed his campaign ’s efforts to show his “ support ” for the president -- despite Sessions ' and Trump 's rocky history .
ALABAMA POSTPONES PRIMARY RUNOFF PITTING SESSIONS AGAINST TRUMP - ENDORSED TUBERVILLE
“ The Trump Campaign has learned that your U.S. Senate campaign is circulating mailers like the one I have enclosed , in which you misleadingly promote your connections to and ‘ support ’ of President Trump , ” Glassner wrote in the letter , which was first reported by The New York Times and later obtained by Fox News .
Glassner attached the mailer , which was a form for Sessions ’ donors and mentioned Trump by name “ 22 times . ”
“ The letter even makes the delusional assertion that you are President Trump ’s “ # 1 Supporter , ” Glassner wrote .
“ We only assume your campaign is doing this to confuse President Trump ’s loyal supporters in Alabama into believing the President supports your candidacy in the upcoming primary runoff election . ”
He added : “ Nothing could be further from the truth . ”
“ We want to be absolutely clear about it , ” Glassner wrote .
“ President Trump and the Trump Campaign unambiguously endorse Tommy Tuberville . ”
TRUMP SNUBS SESSIONS , ENDORSES TUBERVILLE IN ALABAMA SENATE RACE Glassner went on to quote the president ’s <TIMEX3 tid="t392" type="DATE" value="2021-03-10">March 10</TIMEX3> endorsement of Tuberville , Sessions ’ primary rival and the former head football coach at Auburn , where he called him a “ winner ” and said he “ has my Complete and Total Endorsement . ”
“ President Trump and his Campaign do not support your efforts to return to the U.S. Senate , ” Glassner wrote .
“ We demand that you and your campaign immediately stop circulating mailers — or any other similar communication — that wrongly suggest otherwise . ”
Both Both Tuberville and Sessions will be on the GOP ticket for a runoff election after no candidate received 50 percent of the vote in <TIMEX3 tid="t393" type="DATE" value="2020-03">last month</TIMEX3> ’s GOP primary .
That runoff was originally scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t395" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">this Tuesday</TIMEX3> , but due to coronavirus , was postponed until <TIMEX3 tid="t396" type="DATE" value="2019-07-14">July 14</TIMEX3> .
Sessions previously held the Senate seat he is running for , which Sen. Doug Jones , D - Ala. , <TIMEX3 tid="t398" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> holds before he vacated it to become Trump ’s attorney general .
Before their relationship soured , Sessions was one of Trump 's most prominent supporters -- he was the first senator to endorse Trump 's presidential campaign in <TIMEX3 tid="t399" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> .
But the president fired Sessions as his attorney general in <TIMEX3 tid="t402" type="DATE" value="2018-11">November 2018</TIMEX3> after frustration over Sessions ' recusal from the Russia investigation .
<TIMEX3 tid="t403" type="DATE" value="2020-03">Last month</TIMEX3> , Sessions responded to Trump ’s endorsement of Tuberville by tweeting that the president “ can endorse anyone he chooses for the U.S. Senate election in Alabama .
But the Constitution expressly empowers the people of Alabama , and only them , to select their Senator .
I intend to take my case directly to the people of Alabama . ”
Fox News was unable to reach Sessions for comment on <TIMEX3 tid="t404" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> .

NSW Health said at the time that about a dozen passengers had felt unwell and taken tests for COVID-19 — though other passengers were not alerted of this update , ultimately departing the ship without screening and traveling home .
A spokesperson for Princess Cruises was not immediately available to offer further comment .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t424" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">April 2</TIMEX3> , there are eight cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew lingering off the coast of NSW , 9News reports .
Though the Australian government has ordered the ships to leave during the coronavirus crisis , they have refused to comply , according to The Guardian .

The popularity of the hit Netflix documentary series “ Tiger King : Murder , Mayhem and Madness ” has shed new light on its subject , Joseph Maldonado - Passage ( better known as Joe Exotic ) and his reported connection to late singer Michael Jackson .
Those who have seen the seven - part series know that in <TIMEX3 tid="t529" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> a fire at Joe Exotic ’s Oklahoma zoo took out not only his recording studio but a nearby facility that housed multiple alligators , all of which died in the blaze .
The fire was suspected to be an arson , but no one was charged .
What the documentary does n’t cover is the fact that the animals that died are believed to have been previously owned by Jackson on his Neverland Ranch .

At the time of the fire , Joe told the Los Angeles Times that seven of the alligators and a crocodile that died in the fire were taken from Neverland following its closure .

The documentary sees those involved with Joe ’s story posit several theories as to who started the fire , with some even believing that Joe started it himself in an effort to destroy potentially damaging footage that was being housed in the recording studio for a potential reality show that was being filmed .

Dr. Sarosh Janjua , a cardiologist who was caught speeding by a Minnesota state trooper and was " issued " five brand new N95 masks instead of a ticket , said on “ Fox Friends ” on <TIMEX3 tid="t547" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that she “ needed to be reminded that ultimately it ’s not toilet paper and N95 masks that are going to save us , it ’s each other . ”
Janjua said she lives in Massachusetts and was working on temporary assignment in Minnesota <TIMEX3 tid="t548" type="DATE" value="2020-03">last month</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t550" type="DATE" value="2020-03-21">March 21</TIMEX3> , Janjua was headed to Minneapolis after getting off work at Essentia Health in Duluth when she was pulled over by Trooper Brian Schwartz for going 85 mph in a 70 mph zone , The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t551" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t552" type="DURATION" value="P1W">One week</TIMEX3> after she was pulled over , Janjua described what happened during the traffic stop in a Facebook post .
“ I waited for him to write me a ticket .
Instead , he told me he was going to let me off with a warning , ” Janjua wrote .
CORONAVIRUS : WHAT TO KNOW
She said he then handed her what she assumed was her license back ,
but were “ five N95 masks , from the supply the state had given him for his protection . ”
Doctors and nurses at U.S. hospitals treating coronavirus patients have reported a shortage of N95 masks , making them a priceless commodity .
“ I burst into tears .
And though it may just have been the cold wind , I think he teared up a little as well , before wishing me well and walking away , ” Janjua wrote in the post .
Speaking via FaceTime on <TIMEX3 tid="t556" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Janjua said , “ It ’s been very isolating to take care of suspected COVID-19 patients .
“ It ’s hard to look at stories of selfishness and hoarding , ” she continued .
“ Whenever you turn on the news it seems like there are more stories of people clearing the shelves and keeping things for themselves rather than giving them away and , I think particularly at that time , I really needed to believe that we ’re going to stay together as human beings and I needed to be reminded that ultimately it ’s not toilet paper and N95 masks that are going to save us , it ’s each other . ”
Janjua ’s Facebook post has gone viral and , as of <TIMEX3 tid="t557" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , had more than 29,000 views and was shared more than 23,000 times .
Reacting to the response on social media , she said , “ I think the emotional and psychological health of this nation has declined quite a bit <TIMEX3 tid="t558" type="DURATION" value="PXW" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last couple of weeks</TIMEX3> especially and it can be very hard to just be locked up at home and just listen to the news and just look at all the scary numbers and we ’re not interacting the way we normally do to reassure ourselves about things .
“ I think people just needed to hear a good story , ” she continued .
“ They needed to hear that we are going to be there for each other . ”
Minnesota State Patrol thanked Janjua in a Facebook post on <TIMEX3 tid="t559" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> , writing , “ Thank you to Sarosh for her hard work and dedication .
Troopers are working hard during the pandemic and are thinking about all the first responders who are caring for Minnesotans during this critical time .

“ It was humbling , ” Janjua continued .
“ I think state troopers and policemen , they often get a very bad rap simply for doing their jobs and I just think that it ’s time they got their due recognition . ”

THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( AP ) - A painting by Dutch master Vincent van Gogh was stolen in an overnight smash - and - grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus , police and the museum said <TIMEX3 tid="t594" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam said " The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in <TIMEX3 tid="t598" type="DATE" value="1884-SP">Spring 1884</TIMEX3> " by the Dutch master was taken in the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t596" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> .

Museum General Director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is " angry , shocked , sad " at the theft .
The value of the work , which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen , was not immediately known .

"
This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen - removed from the community , " he added .
" It is very bad for the Groninger Museum , it is very bad for the Singer , but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us , the community , to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from , especially in these difficult times . "
The 10 - by-22 - inch oil on paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background .
It dates to a time when the artist had moved back to his family in a rural area of the Netherlands and painted the life he saw there , including his famous work " The Potato Eaters , " in mostly somber tones .
Later , he moved to southern France , where he developed a far more colorful , vibrant style of painting as his health declined before his death in <TIMEX3 tid="t606" type="DATE" value="1890">1890</TIMEX3> .
Police said in a statement that the thief or thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum .
That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it were gone .
A team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbors .
Van Os said the museum 's security worked " according to protocol , " but he added : " Obviously we can learn from this . "
The Dutch government on <TIMEX3 tid="t608" type="DATE" value="2020-03-12">March 12</TIMEX3> banned large crowds among its measures to halt the spread of the virus , leading several museums to close temporarily .
Before the closure , the museum was hosting an exhibition titled " Mirror of the Soul " with works by artists ranging from Jan Toorop to Piet Mondrian , in cooperation with Amsterdam 's Rijksmuseum .
The Singer Laren 's collection has a focus on modernism such as neo - impressionism , pointillism , expressionism and cubism .

It is not the first high profile theft from the museum .

“ People ask when is this over , I think the testing , you tell me when they come up with an inexpensive home test or point of care test that can be brought to volume , I think that ’s probably when you see a real return to normalcy in the workforce , " he said .
“ If you could test <TIMEX3 tid="t663" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">today</TIMEX3> millions of people , you could send them to work <TIMEX3 tid="t664" type="DATE" value="2020-04-06">tomorrow</TIMEX3> . ”

" I know we feel under attack , " Cuomo said .
"
No one is going to attack New York unfairly , and no one is going to deprive New York of what it needs . "
Trump ended up not ordering a quarantine , and Rhode Island repealed its order .
Cuomo also addressed the struggles families will face in the <TIMEX3 tid="t665" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> with the <TIMEX3 tid="t666" type="DATE" value="2021-04-04">Easter</TIMEX3> and Passover holidays , which are typically celebrated with religious services and family gatherings .

Bolsonaro himself denied reports he tested positive for the coronavirus but has refused to publish his medical test results .

“ I ’m the manager of the team and the team is playing very well . ”

Taliban, Afghan government held Skype call on prisoner releases, officials say .
<TIMEX3 tid="t879" type="TIME" value="2020-03-23T01:10:58">2020-03-23 01:10:58</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot interviews Afghan president Ashraf Ghani .
Amid a <TIMEX3 tid="t880" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> warming of relations , the Taliban and the Afghan government held a “ virtual ” meeting to discuss prisoner releases on <TIMEX3 tid="t881" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> , according to officials .
The two sides spoke for <TIMEX3 tid="t882" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> in a Skype meeting facilitated by the U.S. and Qatar .
Under a Taliban peace agreement signed by the U.S. <TIMEX3 tid="t883" type="DATE" value="2020-03">last month</TIMEX3> , the Afghan government was to release 5,000 prisoners before intra - Afghan talks began .
In exchange , the Taliban would release 1,000 Afghani prisoners .
But , <TIMEX3 tid="t884" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> after the peace deal was signed , Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected the notion of releasing Afghan prisoners as a precondition for peace negotiations .
The impasse threatened the historic peace agreement which included the withdrawal of the bulk of foreign forces from Afghanistan after <TIMEX3 tid="t886" type="DURATION" value="P18Y">18 years</TIMEX3> of fighting .
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT
TO RELEASE 1,500 TALIBAN PRISONERS , MAJOR STEP IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS On <TIMEX3 tid="t888" type="DATE" value="2020-03-10">March 10</TIMEX3> , Ghani agreed to release 1,500 prisoners as a precondition to talks with the Taliban -- and an additional 500 prisoners <TIMEX3 tid="t889" type="SET" value="P2W" quant="EVERY">every two weeks</TIMEX3> after talks began until the number reached 5,000 .
It was unclear whether the Taliban would accept the deal , as they previously had refused to speak to the Afghan government until all prisoners were released .
" Everyone knows clearly that the threat of Coronavirus makes the release of prisoners urgent , " U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted .
“ All sides reaffirmed their firm commitment to reducing violence , inter - Al - Afghani negotiations , and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire .
We also agreed on the next technical meeting in <TIMEX3 tid="t891" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next couple of days</TIMEX3> , ” Khalilzad added .
“ Everyone clearly understands the coronavirus threat makes prisoner releases that much more urgent , ” he said .
“ All sides conveyed their strong commitment to a reduction of violence , intra - Afghan negotiations , and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire . ”

The Taliban ’s Doha office spokesman Suhail Shaheen confirmed the meeting on Twitter but stressed it was only about the release of prisoners .
The Afghan government and the Taliban have sparred often <TIMEX3 tid="t893" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few days</TIMEX3> , including a storming of the Afghan military base on <TIMEX3 tid="t892" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> , which investigators blamed on the insurgent group .

Hannity to Biden: Stop fundraising off and politicizing the coronavirus .

Former Vice President Biden is confused yet again .
As the country comes together to battle the COVID-19 pandemic , Biden seems to think that it was all President Trump ’s fault .
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t898" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> statement , he accuses the president of “ dithering on preparing ” for the pandemic , and “ lying ” about the federal government ’s response .
PETER NAVARRO :
CORONAVIRUS – HOW BUSINESSES ARE STEPPING UP , COLLABORATING WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Per usual , Biden is struggling with reality .
So let ’s take a walk down memory lane .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t899" type="DATE" value="2020-01-21">Jan. 21</TIMEX3> , the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the United States .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t900" type="DATE" value="2020-01-31">10 days later</TIMEX3> , on <TIMEX3 tid="t901" type="DATE" value="2020-01-31">Jan. 31</TIMEX3> , President Trump declared a public health emergency , implemented quarantines and announced a ban on travel to and from China .
On the very <TIMEX3 tid="t904" type="DATE" value="2020-01-31">same day</TIMEX3> , Biden called the president ’s response “ hysterical xenophobia ” , and “ fear - mongering ” .
To <TIMEX3 tid="t906" type="DATE" value="2020-01-31">this day</TIMEX3> , Biden is STILL against travel bans of any kind — even though Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said the bans saved us from untold amounts of suffering .
In the days and weeks after <TIMEX3 tid="t907" type="DATE" value="2020-01-31">Jan. 31</TIMEX3> , the Trump administration organized a massive public - private partnership , implemented brand new drive - up testing sites , engaged the U.S. military for support , cut red tape across the board to speed up research and development , and declared a national emergency .
My message to Joe Biden is simple : If you refuse to be a part of the solution , you might consider heading to a church ( reminder – it ’s <TIMEX3 tid="t908" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> , not “ Super <TIMEX3 tid="t909" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> ” ) , and pray to … “ you know the thing . ”
The response is unprecedented , but pandemics are not .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t912" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April 2009</TIMEX3> , during the H1N1 outbreak ( or N1H1 , as Biden mistakenly called it ) , Obama ’s Health and Human Services Department quickly declared a public health emergency .
However , the Obama / Biden administration failed to declare a national emergency until <TIMEX3 tid="t915" type="DATE" value="2009-10">October 2009</TIMEX3> .
By that point , over 1,000 Americans had been killed by the disease and tens of thousands more were infected .
In the first year of the H1N1 pandemic , nearly 13,000 Americans lost their lives .
Ultimately , over 60 million Americans contracted the virus , and hundreds of thousands were hospitalized .

Clearly , he ’s does n’t remember his administration ’s lackluster response in <TIMEX3 tid="t916" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , or perhaps , he still does n’t understand the seriousness of a worldwide pandemic .
Because <TIMEX3 tid="t917" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , instead of lending support , he ’s using this crisis as a political weapon .
In fact , his campaign is fundraising off of COVID-19 .
Yes , Biden is actually trying to raise money in the middle of a pandemic .
My message to Joe Biden is simple : If you refuse to be a part of the solution , you might consider heading to a virtual church ( reminder – it ’s <TIMEX3 tid="t918" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> , not “ Super <TIMEX3 tid="t919" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> ” ) , and pray to … “ you know the thing ” ( God the Creator of everything ) .
Or , perhaps , you could just ask your son , Hunter “ Zero experience ” Biden , for some of his millions , so you can travel the world , and let the adults respond to this crisis in a serious manner .
By the way , if you ’re wondering who to blame for the outbreak , ask your son .
I hear he knows a lot about the country of China .
And while you ’re at it , you can ask them how Hunter got that lucrative deal with the Bank of China .

Bill Hemmer provides a coronavirus country comparison showing where cases are rising and translates the domestic virus story
Although Amazon has taken steps to ban countless scam products that claim to cure or treat coronavirus , the retailer is still flooded with third - party sellers using bogus reviews and other manipulative methods to sell fake N95 masks to panicked people .
A Gizmodo scrape of 75 products returned from a search for “ N95 Medical Masks ” on Amazon revealed thousands of “ verified purchase ” reviews across 13 different products that were likely generated by bots or were plagiarized from completely unrelated products .
The problem of fake reviews is nothing new for the Seattle - based company , of course .
A British consumer report in <TIMEX3 tid="t963" type="DATE" value="2019-04">April 2019</TIMEX3> found that many tech products were being boosted by fake reviews .
Just 24 pairs of headphones contained 10,000 reviews from unverified purchasers , a strong sign of being fake .

<TIMEX3 tid="t967" type="DATE" value="2020-03">Last March</TIMEX3> , for the first time ever , the Federal Trade Commission took an Amazon seller to court for allegedly purchasing fake reviews to boost a product on the platform .
Sen. Edward Markey , D - Mass. , sent the FTC a letter that urged the agency to crack down on online scams related to COVID-19 .
" The FTC should not allow any consumer to suffer from a scam or predatory business practice during this public health emergency , " the letter states .
Saoud Khalifah , the founder and CEO of Fakespot , a firm using machine learning to find fake reviews and fraud as a way to make online shopping more transparent , told Gizmodo the third - party sellers " are using fake reviews to pump their product when people search for antiviral masks .
Our system gives all the aforementioned examples F and D grade for fraud and people should be wary buying them . ”

According to Gizmodo , Fakespot uses a database of over 6 billion reviews to train a machine learning model to “ recognize patterns of inauthenticity and deception ” in Amazon listings .

Many institutions of higher education , both private and state , are taking a similar approach .
As they embark on this new strategy of education , many students may be concerned of the impact this will have on the remainder of their semester , including major events ( such as graduation ) and their individual academic success .
But , like many universities following a similar plan of action , for our campus this temporary shift to remote instruction will not change the academic calendar .
At Southeastern , our final exams , start and end dates for the semester , and our commitment to academic excellence will remain the same .
Moving to a remote and virtual learning space , we are seeking to remain flexible and supportive of all of our students throughout this season .
Similar to how other campuses are operating , faculty will continue to communicate directly with students as their classes progress forward , and remain on schedule .
Of course , these transitions to remote instruction require patience and cooperation .
Both parents and students may be alarmed by these developments , but these steps of action are being taken as a precaution .
All of this is in an effort to contribute to the decrease of the spread of the coronavirus .
Our teams continue to work diligently to accommodate this transition for our campus , and we are providing additional information as it becomes available .
During this time , our administration , faculty and staff will continue to remain focused on their roles to see our students succeed .
While the <TIMEX3 tid="t1127" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> present a very different way of doing life together as a university , we believe this season will only strengthen us further .
It is easy to allow stressful situations to get the best of us , and these uncertain times surely present a unique way of approaching education .

Hannity: This Trump decision likely saved 'thousands and thousands of Americans' from contracting coronavirus .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1287" type="TIME" value="2020-03-03T04:33:46">2020-03-03 04:33:46</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
President Trump 's critics are using the natural fear of the coronavirus as a political weapon .
Sean Hannity spent much of his opening monologue <TIMEX3 tid="t1288" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">Monday</TIMEX3> lambasting Democrats for " weaponizing " the coronavirus outbreak and creating chaos hours after officials confirmed the virus has killed a total of six people in the U.S.
" It needs to be very clear to every American ... that the Democrats , the media mob , they will stop at nothing .
They will do anything , and I mean anything , to stop Donald Trump , " Hannity said .
" They will do anything , and I mean anything , to stop Donald Trump . "
— Sean HannityThe primetime host added Democrats have resorted to the use of " natural fear of a virus as a political weapon , " an indication that their " rage , hate - Trump psychosis is far worse than I thought . "

" The level of derangement is off the charts , " he added .
Hannity applauded President Trump 's early efforts to contain the virus , recounting Trump 's decision in <TIMEX3 tid="t1290" type="DATE" value="2021-01" mod="END">late January</TIMEX3> to close America to foreign nationals who had been to China within <TIMEX3 tid="t1293" type="DURATION" value="P14D">the past 14 days</TIMEX3> .
" My sources who were actually in the room when the president made this decision ... said , ' Well , there are about 25 people in the room .
No one agreed with the president to implement the travel ban , said that there would be political consequences if he did , ' " Hannity said .
" But he did it anyway , and he did it in record time .
Everyone else said , ' Well , maybe it 's too early . '
He made the call , and my sources confirmed to me <TIMEX3 tid="t1294" type="TIME" value="2020-04-05TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> ...
this one early bold decision of this president likely prevented thousands and thousands of Americans from contracting this virus . "
The host then expressed confidence in the task force assembled by the president and railed against the mainstream media who seemed uninterested in Barack Obama 's delayed response to the <TIMEX3 tid="t1295" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> swine flu outbreak .
" So far , thankfully less than ten people in the country have died from this virus , " Hannity said .
" <TIMEX3 tid="t1296" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , we need to put that in perspective .
Let us compare this to the swine flu virus .
It hit the U.S.
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1299" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April of 2009</TIMEX3> .
It was n't until <TIMEX3 tid="t1302" type="DATE" value="2009-10">six months later</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t1303" type="DATE" value="2009-10">October of 2009</TIMEX3> , after more than 20,000 Americans were hospitalized , more than 1,000 of our fellow citizens died , [ that ] President Obama declared a national emergency . "
Hannity continued , " <TIMEX3 tid="t1305" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> do you remember at that time anybody in the media stirring up these types of hysteria as they are doing <TIMEX3 tid="t1306" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ?
Do you remember the end of days predictions ?
Did the stock market tank because of all the reckless lying and fearmongering ?
That did not happen in <TIMEX3 tid="t1307" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .
In fact , the market went up , as swine flu cases mounted . "
" Pretty interesting ... a tale of two presidents , " he went on .
Hannity said the double standard indicates a " corrupt and morally bankrupt media mob . "
" The one thing they care about and the only thing is placating the psychotic rage and hypocrisy and double standard because they hate Donald Trump . "
Addressing his audience just hours before Super <TIMEX3 tid="t1309" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , Hannity called on his viewers to fight back in <TIMEX3 tid="t1308" type="DATE" value="2020-11">November</TIMEX3> .

Some human coronaviruses can live on surfaces for <TIMEX3 tid="t1314" type="DURATION" value="P9D">9 days</TIMEX3>, study finds .

Chinese health officials sent out an optimistic message about progress against the coronavirus , the South Korean Prime Minister says the country has entered an emergency phase ; Fox News correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports .
The novel coronavirus that ’s sickened nearly 80,000 people globally and killed some 2,600 may be able to live on surfaces , namely metal , glass or plastic , for <TIMEX3 tid="t1322" type="DURATION" value="P9D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to nine days</TIMEX3> — if it resembles some of its other human coronavirus - causing “ cousins , ” that is .
In an analysis of 22 studies on other human coronaviruses — such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) , and endemic human coronaviruses ( HCoV ) — researchers found the viruses can “ persist on inanimate surfaces like metal , glass or plastic for <TIMEX3 tid="t1323" type="DURATION" value="P9D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to nine days</TIMEX3> . ”
More specifically , the viruses can remain infectious on such materials between “ <TIMEX3 tid="t1325" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t1324" type="DURATION" value="P9D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to nine days</TIMEX3> , ” according to the paper published in The Journal of Hospital Infection .
ARE PACKAGES FROM CORONAVIRUS - HIT CHINA SAFE TO HANDLE ?
The researchers also found that temperatures of 30 or 40 degrees Celsius ( about 86 degrees Fahrenheit and 104 degrees Fahrenheit , respectively )
“ reduced the duration of persistence ” of some of the viruses .
What ’s more , they also found that many of the coronaviruses studied could be “ efficiently inactivated ” by common household cleaners .
Disinfectants “ with 62 - 71 percent ethanol , 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite ” — bleach — was able to inactive the viruses within <TIMEX3 tid="t1327" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> , according to the study .
“ We expect a similar effect against the SARS - CoV-2 , ” or the novel coronavirus , researchers said .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) on its website warns human coronaviruses most commonly spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes , close contact with an infected person ( shaking hands , for example ) , but also by touching an object or surface that has been exposed to the virus , then touching your mouth , nose , or eyes with dirty hands .
COULD CORONAVIRUS BECOME A PANDEMIC ?
WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CLASSIFICATION Transmission via inanimate objects sparked concerns that imported goods from China could pose a health risk .
But an infectious disease expert previously told Fox News it ’s unlikely the virus will survive the journey from China to your front door .
“ The virus on materials they ordered would not survive such a trip .
Outside the body , we believe this virus only survives on [ an ] object minutes to <TIMEX3 tid="t1329" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> or so , not the days it takes your goods to travel the globe , ” Patricia A. Stinchfield , vice president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases ( NFID ) , told Fox News at the time .
“
As always after handling things , wash your hands before touching your eyes , nose or mouth . ”

Starbucks has implemented procedures where customers order coffee via its app and then wait outside its cafés until receiving a pick - up notice , Reuters reported .
Orders are placed on tables just inside café entrances .
If customers enter Starbucks locations , they must submit to having their temperature taken at the door , as fever is one of the main symptoms of infection , and baristas wear masks .
For delivery , Starbucks said it regularly sterilizes containers and its delivery people have their temperature taken daily , the report said .
Indoors staff must wash hands every <TIMEX3 tid="t1346" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">30 minutes</TIMEX3> , and public areas are sterilized every <TIMEX3 tid="t1344" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> .

Two men snuck into a bedroom with machetes after being hired to carry out a stranger 's sexual fantasy of being tied up in his underwear and stroked with a broom , only to discover they had got the wrong address .
The pair from Sydney , Australia , made their apologies and left the startled victim 's bedside as soon as they realized their mistake .
One of the men , Terrence Leroy , has <TIMEX3 tid="t1357" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been acquitted of entering the home in <TIMEX3 tid="t1358" type="DATE" value="2019-07">July 2019</TIMEX3> intending to intimidate while armed with an offensive weapon , after the New South Wales district court accepted his explanation .
Conceding " the facts of the case are unusual , " judge Sean Grant set out his reasons for the not guilty verdict , saying the evidence did not suggest the men 's actions were intentional .
" They carried the machetes either as a prop or something to use in that fantasy , " he said .
" The fantasy was unscripted and there was discretion as to how it would be carried out . "
According to court documents , a man living in western NSW , near Griffith , " wanted a broom handle to be rubbed around his underwear . "
" He was willing to pay $ 5,000 if it was ' really good , ' " court documents said .
Police said the intended client had " history and proclivity for engaging the services of people . "
He had made arrangements with a man on Facebook for people to engage in the role play , and sent his address - before he later updated it after moving house more than 30 miles away .

But the resident of the home where the men mistakenly turned up to told police that when he noticed a light on in his lounge at <TIMEX3 tid="t1359" type="TIME" value="2020-05-29T06:15" mod="APPROX">around 6:15 a.m.</TIMEX3> , he assumed it was a friend who visits daily to make coffee .
He said he called out : " B----- off , it 's too early . "
After hearing a voice asking " is your name Kevin ? "
the man said he turned his light on to see two men he did not recognize standing next to his bed , both holding machetes .
A conversation then ensued , in which the pair repeatedly sought to establish whether he was " Kevin , " each time being told " no " in response .
At one point , one of them asked : " Are you sure you are not Kevin as we were told to come to [ this address ] and pick up Kevin . "

Eventually accepting their error , the duo then left , with one saying " sorry mate " and shaking the resident 's hand , while the other said " bye . "
The resident then called police .

Northam reportedly visited the beach with Mayor Bobby Dye on the second day of the beach ’s reopening , according to local news outlet 13News <TIMEX3 tid="t1440" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> .
Virginia Beach 's reopening is considered a test to see if people can safely follow social distancing rules before other beaches in Virginia reopen .
But Northam , who previously served as an Army doctor , came under fire when images of him surfaced on social media not wearing a face mask and apparently in close contact with other community members .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reminded the public <TIMEX3 tid="t1441" type="DATE" value="2020-W14">this week</TIMEX3> that the coronavirus mainly spreads person - to - person when in close proximity , while it also revealed that surface contamination is far less likely than previously thought .
According to the state - mandated rules , people are allowed to be outside without a mask when sunbathing , swimming and fishing as long as they remain distant from other parties .

A Canadian woman who contracted the coronavirus in <TIMEX3 tid="t1487" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> has tested positive for the illness for an eighth time .
Tracy Schofield from Cambridge , Ontario , came down with COVID-19 symptoms including fever , chills and shortness of breath <TIMEX3 tid="t1490" type="DATE" value="2020-03-30">March 30</TIMEX3> and tested positive for the first time <TIMEX3 tid="t1491" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> , according to CTV News .
Since then , she has taken eight more tests , including one that inexplicably came back negative .
She is <TIMEX3 tid="t1492" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> preparing for her 10th test .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t1493" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> following her first test , Schofield self - quarantined in her room at home where her 17 - year - old son also lives .
During that period , she claims her fever reached 104.1 degrees Fahrenheit , and she also lost her sense of taste and smell .

After producing a positive result seven times , her eighth test came back negative .
“ I cried because I was so happy , ” Schofield said .
But according to World Health Organization guidelines , a patient must test negative twice consecutively before they can be declared “ recovered . ”
Unfortunately , a ninth test found that the virus was still strong in her system .
Health officials have warned that these tests have been known to produce false negatives and positives .
Early anecdotal reports suggested that some test kits correctly detected COVID-19 only 70 percent of the time , meaning about a third of patients would receive a false negative .

US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez wants to raise taxes on the rich — just not pay her own .
The Democratic socialist congresswoman from The Bronx still has n’t paid a 7 - year - old tax bill leftover from a failed business venture .
AOC had founded Brook Avenue Press , a publishing house that sought designers , artists and writers from urban areas to help paint The Bronx in a positive way in children ’s stories , in <TIMEX3 tid="t1528" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> .

As the Post previously reported , public records show the state dissolved the company in <TIMEX3 tid="t1531" type="DATE" value="2016-10">October 2016</TIMEX3> .
The state can make such a move when a business fails to pay corporate taxes or file a return .
The state Tax Department then filed a warrant against her <TIMEX3 tid="t1537" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - defunct business on <TIMEX3 tid="t1535" type="DATE" value="2017-07-06">July 6 , 2017</TIMEX3> , over a $ 1,618.36 unpaid bill .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t1538" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> , the tax warrant had still not been satisfied , and the outstanding balance had grown to $ 2,088.78 , the department said .

But Ocasio - Cortez ’s camp says the rep is challenging the $ 2,088.78 bill because it was issued “ in error . "
AOC 'S TOP AIDE ADMITS GREEN NEW DEAL ABOUT ECONOMY , NOT CLIMATE
“ The congresswoman is still in the process of contesting the tax warrant .
The business has been closed for <TIMEX3 tid="t1545" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t1544" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , and so we believe that the state Tax Department has continued to collect the franchise tax in error , ” said Lauren Hitt , an AOC spokeswoman .
“ As anyone who ’s tried to contest a tax bill in error knows , it takes time , ” Hitt added .

A Utah cop kept explicit photos of a terrified college track star who was being sextorted by her ex — and showed them off to a colleague just days before the young athlete was murdered , according to his force and a damning report <TIMEX3 tid="t1557" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
University of Utah student Lauren McCluskey , 21 , went to campus cops in <TIMEX3 tid="t1560" type="DATE" value="2018-10">October 2018</TIMEX3> because she was so scared of her blackmailer — twisted ex Melvin Rowland , 37 , a registered sex offender — she had already paid an initial $ 1,000 demand , the Salt Lake Tribune said .
POLICE RELEASES ‘ LAST KNOWN FOOTAGE ’ OF MISSING UNIVERSITY OF UTAH STUDENT MACKENZIE LUECK Officer Miguel Deras then saved the explicit images onto his personal phone , showing at least one male colleague — and bragging about being able to ogle them at any time , according to the Tribune ’s investigation .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t1562" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> after she reported the case , McCluskey was shot dead by Rowland — who then killed himself <TIMEX3 tid="t1561" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">the same day</TIMEX3> .
“ The people who were supposed to be helping and protecting Lauren were actually exploiting her , ” the murdered student ’s outraged mother , Jill McCluskey , told the paper .
“ I wish that Deras had used his time to arrest the man who was committing crimes against Lauren . ”
McCluskey ’s parents had <TIMEX3 tid="t1563" type="DATE" value="2019">last year</TIMEX3> already filed a $ 56 million lawsuit over the police handling of the case .
An independent review found Deras did little to investigate the case even when the victims reported attempts to lure her out of her dorm , the paper said .
LYFT DRIVER CLEARED IN DISAPPEARANCE OF UNIVERSITY OF UTAH STUDENT , POLICE SAY
“ This latest revelation makes me wonder when we ’ll hit bottom , ” her father , Matt McCluskey , told the Tribune .
One of Deras ’ colleagues confirmed to campus police that Deras had shown him an image , the force admitted to the Tribune , which said it also spoke to another officer who had overheard the initial conversations .
Deras — who later resigned and <TIMEX3 tid="t1565" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> works for Logan police , 85 miles away — did not respond to several requests for comment , the paper said .
While confirming the claim , university police insisted it was not reported at the time — and only came to light when the Tribune started making requests for records .
“ He was long gone before we had any inkling that that incident with the photo being shown had occurred , ” Lt . Jason Hinojosa told the paper .

The officer who saw the image was not disciplined because he had not asked to see it
, Hinojosa said .
Data later downloaded from Deras ’ phone was either corrupted or from after the McCluskey investigation , the paper said .
Maj .
Scott Stephenson , who oversees all police training in the state under the Utah Department of Public Safety , said it could be grounds for action against Deras ’ police certification .
“ It ’s very alarming to me , ” Stephenson told the Tribune , suggesting it might be a “ policy violation ” for having not been reported earlier .

Iran tankers sailing to Venezuela in effort to undermine US sanctions .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1569" type="TIME" value="2020-05-17T18:43:30">2020-05-17 18:43:30</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
The vote will be an uphill battle for Senate Democrats ; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill .
Iran and Venezuela are working together to circumvent United States sanctions , according to reports .
Five Iranian tankers are sailing to Venezuela , carrying at least $ 45.5 million worth of gasoline and similar products .
The capacity of the ships is believed to be around 175,000 metric tons .
“ This is like a new one for everyone , ” said Capt .
Ranjith Raja , an analyst who tracks oil shipments by sea at the data firm Refinitiv , of the gasoline shipments .
“ We have n’t seen anything like this before . ”
CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Raja notes the ships all appear to have been loaded from the Persian Gulf Star Refinery near Bandar Abbas , Iran , which makes gasoline .
One of the vessels , the Clavel , listed its AIS destination as Caracas beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t1571" type="DATE" value="2019-05-12">May 12</TIMEX3> , according to log data from ship - tracking website MarineTraffic.com .
The vessel later changed its destination as " TO ORDER " <TIMEX3 tid="t1572" type="DATE" value="2019-05-14">two days later</TIMEX3> , though the ship remains on route to what appears to be Venezuela as it leaves the Mediterranean Sea .
Given the crushing U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran , Venezuela appears to be the country willing to accept the shipments .
Raja said Refinitiv had no data on any Iranian gasoline shipment ever going to South America before .
Quoted by a website affiliated to Iranian state television , cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei on <TIMEX3 tid="t1574" type="DATE" value="2020-04-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> said he did not have any information on the ships .

“ We have to sell our oil and we have access to its paths , ” Rabiei said .
“ Iran and Venezuela are two independent nations that have had trade with each other and they will ” in the future .
Iran has warned America that it will retaliate against any actions should America act “ like pirates ” and attack any of the vessels .
“ If the United States , like pirates , intends to create insecurity on international highways , it will take a dangerous risk that will certainly not go unnoticed , ” warned Nour , an Iranian news agency believed to have ties to the country 's Supreme National Security Council .

The FBI coordinated very closely with the Obama White House on the investigation of Michael Flynn , while the Obama Justice Department was asleep at the switch .
That is among the most revealing takeaways from <TIMEX3 tid="t1583" type="DATE" value="2020-04-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> ’s decision by Attorney General Bill Barr to pull the plug on the prosecution of Flynn , who fleetingly served as President Trump ’s first national security adviser .

While working on the Trump transition team in <TIMEX3 tid="t1588" type="DATE" value="2016-12">December 2016</TIMEX3> , Flynn spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak , in conversations that were intercepted by our government ( because Russian - government operatives , such as Kislyak , are routinely monitored by the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies ) .

After the main briefing , the president asked Yates and FBI director James Comey to stick around to meet with him , along with Vice President Biden and National Security Adviser Susan Rice .
Yates was taken aback when Obama explained that he had “ learned of the information about Flynn ” and his conversation with Kislyak .
She was startled because , she later told investigators , she “ had no idea what the president was talking about . ”

They have no intention of abiding by the restrictions they impose on their citizens .
Tucker Carlson opened <TIMEX3 tid="t1666" type="DATE" value="2020-04-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> 's edition of " Tucker Carlson <TIMEX3 tid="t1667" type="TIME" value="2020-04-05TNI">Tonight</TIMEX3> " by slamming Democratic public officials who he claimed are abusing their powers and ignoring the disparity between the effects of coronavirus and those of the draconian measures they are instituting .
" Across the country , our leaders are making a mockery of the quarantines they so enthusiastically enforce , " Carlson said , later adding , " They have no intention of abiding by the restrictions that they impose on their fellow citizens , they have no interest in any scientific development ...
[ even as ] evidence accumulates that mass quarantines are not achieving what politicians claimed they would achieve , not even close . "
The host criticized former President Barack Obama for ignoring stay - at - home orders in the District of Columbia and Virginia to go golfing at the elite Robert Trent Jones Country Club in Prince William County , Va. , about 40 miles from his Washington home .
Showing a photo of Obama golfing that was published by Politico , Carlson said the former president " is clearly enjoying himself and honestly , why would n't he be ?
It 's beautiful out on the links .
" You 'll notice there are n't many people around , " the host added , " and that 's because both Virginia and Washington , D.C. , are still under quarantine .
Everybody else is locked at home , as they have been for <TIMEX3 tid="t1669" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> , but not former President Obama .
For him , golfing at his country club was an essential activity . "
Carlson noted that <TIMEX3 tid="t1671" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> after Obama was photographed on the golf course , District of Columbia residents received an automated phone message from Michelle Obama " urg[ing them ] to stay home except if you need essential health care , food or supplies -- or go to an essential job . "
" It did n't seem to occur to her that those standards might also apply to her family and that 's why she did n't mention essential trips to your country club , " Carlson said .
Carlson then turned to the state of Maine , whose Democratic governor , Janet Mills , extended the state 's stay - at - home order through <TIMEX3 tid="t1674" type="DATE" value="2020-05" mod="END">the end of May</TIMEX3> , with hotels and bars prohibted from reopening until <TIMEX3 tid="t1675" type="DATE" value="2020-07-01">July 1</TIMEX3> at the earliest .
" She told every church to keep its doors locked , ensuring that many of them will go defunct and disappear forever , " Carlson said of Mills , adding that at " the very moment [ Mills ] spoke , a grand total of 33 people were being treated in Maine hospitals for the coronavirus , 33 people out of a population of more than 1.3 million people .
Over the full course of this entire epidemic , just 51 people in the state of Maine have died from the coronavirus .

" You may be wondering where exactly does Janet Mills derive the power to invent a new normal for 1.3 million people , to remake human society in whatever form she chooses ? "
Carlson continued .
" Mills did not explain that . "
" People in power abuse their power -- that may be the lesson here , " he concluded .
" The arrival of a terrifying new virus from China gave our leaders more power than anyone has had in the history of this country .

With a field hospital set up in New York 's Central Park , there 's no doubt this is a battle ; a battle against an unseen enemy called the coronavirus .
Mount Sinai Hospital chaplain Rocky Walker believes he 's facing an even greater foe than he did <TIMEX3 tid="t1690" type="DATE" value="1990" mod="APPROX">nearly 30 years ago</TIMEX3> , when he served on the front lines of Operation Desert Storm in Iraq .
" I feel like I 'm much closer to death <TIMEX3 tid="t1693" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> than I was then .
Back then I was a field artillery lieutenant , " Walker told Fox News . "
With the COVID deaths <TIMEX3 tid="t1694" type="DATE" value="2020-04-05">today</TIMEX3> ...
These are all not just Americans , but these ... are innocent people . "
LAUREN GREEN : CORONAVIRUS CRISIS -- WHY SOME CHURCHES ARE DEFYING BANS ON GATHERING
Walker is one of several chaplains at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan 's Upper East Side .
He is on the front lines of this pandemic , providing spiritual and emotional support to patients and hospital staff in the city that never sleeps , which is the epicenter of America 's outbreak .
All the chaplains help people of all different faiths , even those without any stated religion .

LEADERSHIP ON HELPING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY RECOVER FROM CORONAVIRUS
" My job is to try to figure that out ... read between the lines and then meet them where they are , " he said .
"
All chaplains are trained to walk right alongside them where their faith is . "
While most COVID-19 patients will recover – Mount Sinai has discharged at least 2,000 – many do not .
And those are the ones Walker looks after , as he is the chaplain overseeing the intensive care unit .
He sees the most severe cases of the disease , sometimes providing a FaceTime chat for families and loved ones .
He ca n't go into a patient 's room , but through the glass doors can give families a view of their loved one .
" I 'll walk right up to the door and I 'll let them see their family members , which is oftentimes very hard to see someone they love hooked up to so many different machines , " he said , adding that he uses his own phone of FaceTime calls .
"
And at that time , it 's very personal between them and the family .
Sometimes I pray with them .
Sometimes I just let them look in . "
PETER ROSENBERGER :
CORONAVIRUS — AS A CAREGIVER FOR 30 YEARS , I KNOW HEALING POWER OF THIS ONE THING
Witnessing dozens of deaths has been difficult and painful for the staff .
The hardest cases are when the end comes too quickly .
" There 's been more than one for me that the patient dies before we could bring the family in , " Walker said , choking back tears . "
And that 's hard . "
As the virus continues to claim victims , his task is to help medical staff deal with the mounting battle fatigue .
The chaplain staff has provided a small safe room for them where they can cry , scream , or just sit and ponder the existential reality .
Walker sees his job as a humbling spiritual responsibility .

He offers these heartfelt words in prayer : " God you trust me to be with this person , right as they 're coming to meet you , " he said .
" It 's such an honor to me that all the people on Earth you would trust me to walk them or to walk with their family in this moment . "

Ted Cruz to introduce legislation preventing Chinese 'propaganda' from exploiting FCC regulations .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1698" type="TIME" value="2020-04-25T22:32:55">2020-04-25 22:32:55</TIMEX3> +00:00 .
Foreign Relations Committee member Sen. Ted Cruz on issues surrounding China 's actions before and after the COVID-19 outbreak .
Sen. Ted Cruz , R - Texas , announced <TIMEX3 tid="t1699" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> that he intends to introduce legislation that would prevent outlets -- like China 's Phoenix TV -- from using Canadian or Mexican stations to spread foreign propaganda across U.S. airwaves .
The move comes as the U.S. has criticized the Chinese government for its role in spreading disinformation about the coronavirus , which is thought to have originated in a lab in Wuhan .
Cruz 's office specifically mentioned Phoenix TV , which is reportedly using a Mexican broadcast tower to transmit Chinese propaganda into the U.S.
According to a press release , this particular legislation would amend communications law in a way that would preclude the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) from granting licenses to " broadcast applicants who intend to change the language of the station they are purchasing , unless the FCC can certify that the programming of the station will never be influenced by a foreign government or governing party . "
" China should not be able to set up shop in Mexico and blanket America with propaganda , " Cruz said in the press release .
CNN 'S HARWOOD CALLS TRUMP ' AUTHORITARIAN ' FOR QUESTIONING MEDIA OUTLET TIED TO CHINA 'S GOVERNMENT
" <TIMEX3 tid="t1700" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">Every year</TIMEX3> , the CCP [ Chinese Communist Party ] spends billions of dollars purchasing news outlets and waging information warfare to extend the reach of its propaganda and whitewash the unflattering and politically inconvenient truths about its totalitarian regime . "
He added : " We are seeing this play out <TIMEX3 tid="t1701" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> as news outlets across the country parrot Chinese talking points about the coronavirus pandemic -- a pandemic that could have prevented .
I look forward to introducing this legislation when Congress returns and closing FCC loopholes that allow China to wage their information warfare from across the border in Mexico . "
Phoenix TV previously caught attention when Trump questioned one of its reporters at a press briefing earlier in <TIMEX3 tid="t1702" type="DATE" value="2020-04">April</TIMEX3> on the coronavirus .
" Sounds like a statement more than a question , " Trump said at the time .
The reporter went on to cite a Chinese ambassador 's op - ed calling for cooperation with the United States .
" Are you personally working directly with China ? "
she asked .
TED CRUZ PRAISES BILL MAHER FOR ' RANT ' ABOUT CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATING IN CHINA
After Trump cited his trade agreement with China , the reporter again asked whether he was cooperating with China .
" Who are you working for ?
China ?
" Trump responded .
Phoenix TV is partially owned by a company backed by China 's government , and U.S. intelligence has reportedly identified the station as a propaganda outlet .

In <TIMEX3 tid="t1703" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , The Washington Post reported that Phoenix TV CEO Liu Changle served in the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) and worked as a " military journalist " for Central People 's Radio , a state - owned outlet that was later renamed " China National Radio .
" The Hoover Institution at Stanford University previously labeled Phoenix TV as " quasi - official " state media , adding it was " completely controlled by [ the ] Chinese government . "
Cruz previously expressed concern about this issue in <TIMEX3 tid="t1704" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> when the FCC was reviewing an application from a company -- HH Group --
tied to the Chinese government and Phoenix TV .
" I am concerned that approving this application would enhance the ability of the Chinese Communist Party [ CCP ] to broadcast objectionable political propaganda into America and to interfere in American domestic politics , " Cruz said at the time .

“ These three individuals died at home during a time when very limited testing was available only through the CDC , ” the county said in a statement .

Santa Clara officials believe that limited testing has led to an undercount of cases and deaths , a similar phenomenon that has played out in other municipalities and countries , including New York City .
“ As the Medical Examiner - Coroner continues to carefully investigate deaths throughout the county , we anticipate additional deaths from COVID-19 will be identified , ” the statement said .

Somehow , while fiddling with bloody hands , President Trump managed to impose his ban on alien - arrivals from China on <TIMEX3 tid="t1741" type="DATE" value="2021-01-31">January 31</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t1742" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic .
Since then , among many things , Team Trump has : deployed two hospital ships , some of whose medical personnel have disembarked to relieve their counterparts on shore .
ordered construction of 21 temporary infirmaries housing 8,540 medical - station beds .
rallied unprecedented private - sector initiatives and public – private partnerships .
accelerated trials of potential vaccines and the <TIMEX3 tid="t1743" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> or imminent use of 35 different therapeutics .

President Trump announced at the White House coronavirus press briefing on <TIMEX3 tid="t1752" type="DATE" value="2020-03-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that the United States will immediately halt all funding for the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , saying it had put " political correctness over lifesaving measures . "
Trump declared that the United States " will be forced " to pursue other options as it reviews why the WHO had caused " so much death " by " severely mismanaging and covering up " the coronavirus ' spread .
" We have deep concerns over whether America 's generosity has been put to the best use possible , " Trump said , accusing the WHO of failing to adequately keep the international community apprised of the threat of the coronavirus .
"
The WHO failed in this duty , and must be held accountable , " Trump said .
He added that the WHO had ignored " credible information " in <TIMEX3 tid="t1755" type="DATE" value="2019-12">December 2019</TIMEX3> that the virus could be transmitted from human to human .
As early as <TIMEX3 tid="t1757" type="DATE" value="2019-12" mod="END">late December</TIMEX3> , Wuhan medical staff were suspected to have contracted the disease , indicating likely human - to - human transmissibility .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1759" type="DATE" value="2020-01-04">January 4</TIMEX3> , in a statement first flagged by The National Review , the head University of Hong Kong ’s Centre for Infection warned that “ the city should implement the strictest possible monitoring system for a mystery new viral pneumonia that has infected dozens of people on the mainland , as it is highly possible that the illness is spreading from human to human . "
The Chinese government also began suppressing news about the virus .
Nevertheless , on <TIMEX3 tid="t1761" type="DATE" value="2020-01-08">January 8</TIMEX3> , the WHO declared : “ Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China ’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks . "
Again on <TIMEX3 tid="t1764" type="DATE" value="2020-01-14">January 14</TIMEX3> , the WHO simply echoed Chinese government statements :
“ Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human - to - human transmission of the novel coronavirus ( <TIMEX3 tid="t1762" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3> - nCoV ) identified in Wuhan , China . ”

By <TIMEX3 tid="t1771" type="DATE" value="2020-01-19">January 19</TIMEX3> , the WHO had changed its tune .
“ Not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted , the clinical features of the disease , the extent to which it has spread , or its source , which remains unknown . "
Several media organizations had also uncritically cited WHO 's assurances about the coronavirus .
MEDIA , DEMS CHANGE TUNE ON
TRUMP CHINA
TRAVEL BAN
The Washington Post even ran a story quoting a Chinese official asking for " empathy " and slamming the White House for acting " in disregard of the WHO recommendation against travel restrictions . "
Former Vice President Joe Biden , just hours after Trump announced travel restrictions on China on <TIMEX3 tid="t1772" type="DATE" value="2020-01-31">Jan. 31</TIMEX3> , criticized the president 's " hysterical xenophobia . "
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1773" type="DATE" value="2020-03">March</TIMEX3> , The Post finally acknowledged that critics accused China and WHO of " covering up or downplaying the severity of an infectious disease outbreak . "
This is a developing story .

A source told Fox News that it is unclear whether there will be people from outside of government “ officially ” brought into this council , or if they will only be included in the consultation process .
The president first announced the task force on <TIMEX3 tid="t1786" type="DATE" value="2020-04-03">Friday</TIMEX3> during a coronavirus task force briefing , saying that he understands the gravity of the situation as he prepares to make a decision on whether to ease social distancing guidelines to open the economy , which has been largely shuttered in many states to curb transmission .
“ I would say without question it ’s the biggest decision I ’ve ever had to make , ” Trump said .

The video games we had in <TIMEX3 tid="t1821" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> were visually uninteresting ( though I spent hours playing “ Frogger ” and “ Donkey Kong ” ) .
Screen time was unheard of -- and <TIMEX3 tid="t1822" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it is something kids and parents argue about <TIMEX3 tid="t1823" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
And as a result these days , kids struggle to imagine and create their own entertainment .
Then came social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic .
There was only so much looking at our phones that our brains could take .
And we ran out of shows to binge upon .
We started to crave other ways to spend all this time at home we are having <TIMEX3 tid="t1824" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
We want to keep communicating , encouraging , laughing and , most importantly , connecting .
And that has led to some wonderfully creative family projects .
For instance , I ’ve loved the family dance videos , such as this one from New Zealand and the coronavirus take on " Les Miserables " by this British family .
One of my favorites of these family endeavors was a video made by Ian Prior and his family .
They recreated the introduction to “ Growing Pains ” with the theme song utilizing his very cheerful and patient family and called it “ Growing Bored . ”

As my assistant and I work from home to get ready for “ The Daily Briefing , ” “ Storytime with Dana , ” and “ The Five , ” we often hear my husband Peter collapsing in laughter , unable to breathe , because of a video or a meme that he ’s just been sent from his son or a friend .
Here ’s one of his favorites .
We ’ve gotten such a kick out of all of it .
It ’s really kept our spirits up .
Keep it coming , Internet !

When some memes have been circulated in the past I have observed that , “ Some people have too much time on their hands . ”
Well , <TIMEX3 tid="t1825" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they do and the results are hilarious .
So if you ’re looking for a silver lining to this shutdown , where boredom has become something we are all grappling with at various times during the day , the reinvigorated imaginations of our fellow humans is certainly one .

Disasters like the coronavirus pandemic destroy things , including illusions .
For example , people assume business owners are rich .
Hardly .
In fact , profit margins are so thin , one storm could blow them over permanently .
Especially restaurants , which are getting hit hard these days .
By the time this is over , a night out will be heading to 7 - Eleven to buy beans .
TOM BASILE : WHO - CHINA CORONAVIRUS FAILURES — TIME FOR US TO DO THIS
AT THE UNITED NATIONS
We worry about waitresses , servers , and of course , every tavern 's ICU specialist , the bartender .
But to help them , you 've got to help the owners first .
It ’s like in airline emergencies , where the parent has to put on the oxygen mask before he or she helps the kids .

The guy who owns the bar needs help first
so then he can then pay his staff .
If not you end up with boarded - up storefronts .
A bustling street becomes skid row .
Towns die this way .
The solution ?
Glad you asked .
I once balanced my checkbook .
So , President Trump , if you 're listening – I know you are – first government needs to make loans directly to business owners .
Cut out hiring requirements .
If the owner ca n’t pay it back , it ’s on him or her .
They did this after 9/11 .
It worked .
The loans should also have a long payback period to reduce thoughts of suicide , because that ’s where debt can lead .
Sixteen percent of all suicides are financially driven .
The second part involves you , the viewer .
You need to go out and spend .
Get that oxygen pumping into the system .
But first , you need an incentive .
So how about for <TIMEX3 tid="t1831" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> , we make meals and beverages tax - deductible ?
Take those bar tabs and mark them all " self - entertainment . "

So if your family goes out and spends $ 200 , you get $ 60 back later .
Let ’s put the “ fun ” in “ refund . ”
Because if we do n’t , you could lose your favorite bar .
Which sucks , because after all this , you ’re going to need a drink .
